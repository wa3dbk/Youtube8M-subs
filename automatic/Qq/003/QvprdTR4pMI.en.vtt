 para para pa for the newsreel of muse 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.449
 hello that such demigods welcome a 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.920
 week more to this news of lol where 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.980
 we will talk about the most notes 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.810
 of the patch 4.8 on skins 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.720
 that are falling and on many others 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.339
 news so let's see it and this 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.130
 striped week has presented us the 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.800
 patch notes 4.8 and we're going to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.570
 reviewing we are going to review the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.820
 most significant notes of this patch 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.860
 so we started with mister bliss 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.170
 they think they have made a little buff and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.150
 is that the cv to the hook and the air that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.580
 is the shield that deals damage that makes 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.890
 explode because they have reduced the manna 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.500
 enough so it will be a little help 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.710
 for this cute champion too 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.050
 nice we passed with ropes of the gentleman 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.350
 ropes that you have to suck yogurt with a 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.820
 small to the latest and it's aired and it's 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.290
 now an increased range is 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.200
 say that now you can eat more 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.700
 distance and they have reduced the time of 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.970
 castellón is to say that if before it lasted 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.890
 050 now of steel like 25 seconds and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 we continue with the next champion who is 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.090
 nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.460
 it's time to reduce the energy of the q 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.130
 that have reduced the damage of those of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.350
 rays of stars falling from the sky and 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.380
 novelty have presented a novelty with 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.899
 soracá which was a skill that did not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.570
 he had mana that gave manna to the ally and 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.670
 The enemy is also silenced 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 Now whenever mutes the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.600
 enemy will spend 50 mana if he goes 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.660
 the ally does not reward anything but if he wins at 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 50 enemy of mana so o game was 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.810
 an ability that had always been 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.119
 well because you could piss it and not 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.560
 nothing was happening but now it seems to be 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.020
 that is now here you will have to think 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.380
 more than twice before going mute 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.330
 to the enemies and we continue with that skins 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.149
 what good shows last week 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.920
 they are skins that will come with this patch 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.140
 4.8 this is the blade win lisandra that already 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.410
 had presented last week and 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.780
 we went through the river spirit naming that 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.959
 good is very much and kauai very very cool 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.760
 If it's not right now, wait for me 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.720
 I like it less I 'm sorry 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.090
 yes it's good we also had it with 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.900
 new invoker icons this is the one of 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.790
 good tics they do honors the way 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.180
 wang foral that by the way with this 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.090
 patch comes the mode mirrors mode that 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.480
 means that now instead of being a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.340
 Team of 515 equal of the two teams 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 they will have to have the same champion is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 say that instead of team collisions 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 There must be 10 licenses all 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.140
 game with the same champion both a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.239
 team like another so let's see how and what 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.600
 this one with the invoker is to do or not 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.070
 now in this way and then we have another 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 what is this here that is called 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.840
 moment of pvh map in taquila so now 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.760
 we'll see what they do with it well then here 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 we have the last victim of a robot 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.850
 visual our dearest cardús that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.880
 well I also thought that I am very 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.620
 fan of cartos of all life and this 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.170
 splash that is the best there is of 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.489
 legends legends but well well I have not 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.819
 put the others because they have not yet 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.219
 fact 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.709
 but good if it is up to the new 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.389
 visual record can be a pass like that 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.819
 let's talk a little about the changes 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.450
 I know you've seen it maybe things 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.180
 most commented of the week but if not 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.909
 you pass here we have what we have 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.519
 been a big change I wanted to make a 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.319
 change of image not because I know it is 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.230
 as a little comical does not seem like a 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.000
 clown and I laugh a lot 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.909
 when I did not get it, it's not scary 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.939
 cartoon laughs to be very funny and 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.680
 with the last one to the one the hatred that 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.659
 has the world to this character is the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.250
 which makes it more comical and funnier 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.810
 he believed but he has made a good 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.000
 change now it is like fear 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.310
 intimidates more and good to me personally 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.889
 It reminds me a lot of the sounders of 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.169
 wow is a priest not some tier of 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.939
 these years ago because it reminds me 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:14.099
 pretty good we're also going with the skins 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.259
 we go with phantom letters that go to 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.299
 improve that is that it has changed 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.639
 very much and good is given to one aspect 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.590
 well it seems quite love of kaiser 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.090
 do not 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.660
 not 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.340
 and we still complete here the cartridge that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.650
 it's very good I keep saying what before 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.889
 that reminds me of something but it's good that 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.479
 I like that brutal but I 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.940
 I defend is equally that they treat us 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.080
 bad is so bad does not make the flush 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.870
 Do not look for your uncles do not dishonor word and 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.380
 we follow them with the cactus statue 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.220
 no, not the vastness of freedom 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.930
 and this would be a green card that also 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.820
 it was very good they seem pretty no 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.680
 it needed a record but well very well 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.630
 the time we like it I have to say that 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.750
 is very good the new visual robot of 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.520
 letters and we went through the good effects 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.050
 also like all the visual rigor 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.889
 they also change the effects this would be 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.129
 the last one not our darling multi 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.629
 nothing the wall that slows down the bombs 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:18.180
 you have also seen the aura and nothing and 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.830
 axis is not anticipated it happens the same 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.379
 good as I did not have a sprays of the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.469
 new clean skin because here I teach it 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:28.289
 not directly to sack is what what's 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.319
 court queen what good then there is water skin 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.729
 and also to be here and 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.580
 you see that it's pretty good this would be 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.650
 the serial times and this would be 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:43.789
 the bird version so good 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.789
 we hope you like tachán bird 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.360
 and to finish as always 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.699
 news then we will make a 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.500
 review of the sales of both skins and 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.590
 of champions we started against the each 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.900
 day d we continue with imperial looks and 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.789
 We finished with Bolívar Storm 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.110
 north and we passed with the champions of 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.699
 rebates that are leona veiga and varus and 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.560
 now we do a review as always to 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.509
 top 3 the division of honor the first 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.699
 team the team that is in the top 1 is 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.740
 salsa don team I remember that the team 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.080
 Céleres was signed by salsa what 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.120
 can be called salsa the last one 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.310
 they also signed master he played like lane 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.289
 and so good because it seems that they are going 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.940
 very good to be in first position in 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.710
 second position is play &amp; overy 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.990
 gaming and in third place we have 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.490
 Charon and good news too 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.710
 about division d'honor that has occurred 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.479
 this week is that the team that has been 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.000
 expelled from division of honor by the 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.699
 lvbp for identity theft 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.819
 it seems that one of the players 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:45.069
 gave his account to a division game 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.470
 of honor, well, he left his account 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.270
 to someone who obviously was not him 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.630
 therefore the pp has taken this 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.159
 decision and good are things that you have to 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.490
 be clear so that it does not return to 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:00.310
 happen so good then nothing that 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.870

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.360
