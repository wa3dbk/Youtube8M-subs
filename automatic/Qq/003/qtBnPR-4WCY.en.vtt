be<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.290> easier<00:00:34.800> than<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> other

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
be a little bit easier than the other

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
be a little bit easier than the other
characters<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.809> Captain<00:00:37.680> America<00:00:38.190> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
characters and I put Captain America in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
characters and I put Captain America in
the<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.610> position<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.780> he's<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the first position because he's got a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
the first position because he's got a
lot<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> hip<00:00:40.950> points<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.579> other<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.239> not

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
lot of hip points and other to do not

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.440 
lot of hip points and other to do not
and<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.710> i<00:00:43.739> played<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.370> Captain<00:00:44.879> America<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and when i played with Captain America I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.590 
and when i played with Captain America I
find<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:47.370> end<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.760> running<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
find that I just end up running out of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.920 
find that I just end up running out of
time<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:50.190> than<00:00:50.370> anything<00:00:50.640> else<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> don't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
time more than anything else so I don't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.729 
time more than anything else so I don't
mind<00:00:52.320> him<00:00:53.449> being<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.469> weak

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
mind him being with two really weak

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
mind him being with two really weak
characters<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.699> they're<00:00:56.879> gonna<00:00:57.000> need

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
characters because they're gonna need

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
characters because they're gonna need
the<00:00:57.449> hip<00:00:57.629> points<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.829> tag<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.399> out

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the hip points and I can tag them out

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.380 
the hip points and I can tag them out
and<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> he<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> heal<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.359> Hawkeye<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and so that he can heal and Hawkeye is
