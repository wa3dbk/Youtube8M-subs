00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.530
 two residents of the village with a share price of housing and 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.609
 social network 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.689
 price 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 its section is not so heavy 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 in the center of the modern car 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's see what happens 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.690
 Russians 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.050
 process 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.900
 now it has changed what the program thought 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.750
 clubs does it have to forcibly 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.740
 must be 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.600
 the second attack varenka now let's 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.630
 try to increase 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 us a lot of machine block 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.680
 let it be 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.060
 at first 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.160
 with population density 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 so let's go 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.510
 types of what has changed 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.950
 so let's try 10 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 can our pilots in the desert 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.710
 the question came up very quickly 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.460
 gives up 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 respectively 20 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.510
 need to admit 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 passed 30 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 we keep on not giving up 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 the mountain we are his victory 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.169
 so we see that how would 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.609
 calculation is made 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.639
 I do not know how correct and so clean 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 physically but to achieve something 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.329
 Paradise areas 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:00.400
 to
