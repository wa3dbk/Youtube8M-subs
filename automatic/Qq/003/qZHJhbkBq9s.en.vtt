00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.909
 I tell myself that I'm Us 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.240
 know yet I savor the season a 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.820
 at one the beats I was scared 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.950
 earth the horizons tin the bites 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.380
 slits like your body on mine 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.809
 I know that yes I love 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.060

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.490
 wings in my back geffroy suits 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.170
 absence is sure on my forehead of 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 armor of helplessness when I hear 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.900
 any name I have much doubted time 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 freeze links ignore passers-by and 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.610
 do not think of anything I want to leave well 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.640
 to say even resign myself but you forget 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.950
 it's my life is an animated dream I want 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.740
 to offer you the world to lose my faith 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.570
 slow down the second when you're near 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 I want to tap the walls 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.520
 even tap up to blood I do not care 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.560
 injuries I want to be alive I 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.990
 want to run out until my last 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.220
 breath create up to the ural on the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.380

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.850
 I can not do it for myself 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.920
 turned towards pretending to exist is seen 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.470
 in my eyes I can not hide anything from you 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.030
 the moment it's a question of hope a 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.890
 willing look I would like to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.410
 undo tasks and your smell 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.390

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.800
 is soaked in hope I would like to give up 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.990
 before it's too late yes but the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.990
 clenched fists and the audacity to believe it
