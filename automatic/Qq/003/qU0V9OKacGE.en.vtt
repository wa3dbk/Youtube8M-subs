last decade satellite internet has come
a<00:00:26.010> long<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.119> wasn't<00:00:27.300> until<00:00:27.599> 2012<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a long way but it wasn't until 2012 that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.529 
a long way but it wasn't until 2012 that
the<00:00:28.740> technology<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.609> took<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the technology really took off with the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.440 
the technology really took off with the
introduction<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.260> Exede<00:00:31.759> we<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.000> kinds

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
introduction of Exede we get all kinds

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.150 
introduction of Exede we get all kinds
of<00:00:33.540> great<00:00:33.719> stuff<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.050> satellite<00:00:34.530> these<00:00:34.710> days

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of great stuff from satellite these days

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
of great stuff from satellite these days
satellite<00:00:35.820> radio<00:00:36.110> GPS<00:00:37.110> navigation<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
satellite radio GPS navigation and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.709 
satellite radio GPS navigation and
chances<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.610> you've<00:00:38.790> already<00:00:38.910> got<00:00:39.210> satellite

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
chances are you've already got satellite

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
chances are you've already got satellite
TV<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.920> takes<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> dish<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:41.820> house

TV all it takes is a dish on your house

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
TV all it takes is a dish on your house
just<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.540> satellite<00:00:43.079> TV

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
just like satellite TV

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.090 
just like satellite TV
so<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.300> Exede<00:00:45.780> Internet<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
so is Exede Internet right for you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
so is Exede Internet right for you
well<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.180> live<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> metro<00:00:48.870> area<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
well if you live in a metro area you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799 
well if you live in a metro area you
probably<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.010> access<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> fiber<00:00:50.879> cable<00:00:51.690> or

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
probably have access to fiber cable or

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.529 
probably have access to fiber cable or
the<00:00:51.899> faster<00:00:52.199> types<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.590> DSL<00:00:53.120> but<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> get

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the faster types of DSL but as you get

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
the faster types of DSL but as you get
further<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.219> speeds<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.460> slower<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
further out speeds get slower and you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.139 
further out speeds get slower and you
just<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.199> many<00:00:58.289> options<00:00:59.149> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just don't have as many options the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
just don't have as many options the
thing<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.329> Exede<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.620> works<00:01:01.770> great
