combination<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.030> concept<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.290> after<00:02:23.680> I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710

practicing<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.340> list<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.510> next<00:02:28.810> thing<00:02:28.960> I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
practicing that list the next thing I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.490 
practicing that list the next thing I
did<00:02:29.110> was<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.980> created<00:02:30.160> finger<00:02:31.030> drills<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.570> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
did was I created finger drills and the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
did was I created finger drills and the
reason<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.860> created<00:02:32.920> finger<00:02:33.490> drills<00:02:33.790> was

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
reason I created finger drills was

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.100 
reason I created finger drills was
because<00:02:34.600> ice<00:02:34.990> noticed<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.630> not<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:37.900> much

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
because ice noticed that not so much

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.710 
because ice noticed that not so much
that<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> concept<00:02:39.730> was<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> problem<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.570> mean

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
that the concept was a problem I mean

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.170 
that the concept was a problem I mean
yes<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.990> was<00:02:41.170> yes<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> difficulty<00:02:42.850> for

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
yes it was yes it was a difficulty for

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.650 
yes it was yes it was a difficulty for
me<00:02:43.209> but<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.320> was<00:02:44.620> also<00:02:44.770> having<00:02:45.250> problems<00:02:45.660> with

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
me but I was also having problems with

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.050 
me but I was also having problems with
the<00:02:46.870> key<00:02:47.050> combination<00:02:47.709> itself<00:02:48.130> my<00:02:48.760> dexterity

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the key combination itself my dexterity

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.680 
the key combination itself my dexterity
wasn't<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.989> great<00:02:50.320> when<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> came<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
wasn't that great when it came to it and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.770 
wasn't that great when it came to it and
so<00:02:52.690> I'm<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.080> finger<00:02:53.440> drills<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.880> could<00:02:55.300> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
so I'm a finger drills so I could that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.320 
so I'm a finger drills so I could that
focused<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.500> key<00:02:56.680> combination<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:58.090> way

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
focused on that key combination that way

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.040 
focused on that key combination that way
it<00:02:58.480> can<00:02:58.600> eliminate<00:02:58.900> any<00:02:59.410> hesitation<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
it can eliminate any hesitation and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.240 
it can eliminate any hesitation and
increase<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.260> control<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:04.120> whenever<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:05.250> key

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
increase my control so whenever that key

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.820 
increase my control so whenever that key
combination<00:03:06.760> comes<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.630> will<00:03:08.200> be<00:03:08.350> natural

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
combination comes up it will be natural

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.810 
combination comes up it will be natural
for<00:03:09.070> me<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.820> hit<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.860> practice

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
for me to just hit it and I practice

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.970 
for me to just hit it and I practice
that<00:03:12.850> drill<00:03:13.330> after<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> made<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.320> practice<00:03:14.800> it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that drill after I made it I practice it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.140 
that drill after I made it I practice it
until<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.459> point<00:03:15.640> where<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:16.000> satisfied

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
until the point where I was satisfied

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.940 
until the point where I was satisfied
and<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:20.049> left<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.739> home

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and then I just left it at home

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.240 
and then I just left it at home
and<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.690> stopped<00:03:23.200> my<00:03:23.350> practice<00:03:23.739> session<00:03:24.070> then

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
and I stopped my practice session then

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.180 
and I stopped my practice session then
but<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> point<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.720> didn't<00:03:26.170> continue<00:03:26.769> my

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but the point is I didn't continue my

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.660 
but the point is I didn't continue my
education<00:03:27.400> practice<00:03:28.830> once<00:03:29.830> I<00:03:29.980> realized<00:03:30.459> that

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
education practice once I realized that

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
education practice once I realized that
I<00:03:30.790> had<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.570> difficulty<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.560> something<00:03:33.160> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
I had a difficulty with something that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.789 
I had a difficulty with something that
was<00:03:33.489> basic<00:03:33.970> something<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.799> fundamental

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
was basic something that is fundamental

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.430 
was basic something that is fundamental
I<00:03:36.540> realized<00:03:37.540> that's<00:03:37.660> more<00:03:37.900> important<00:03:38.380> than

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
I realized that's more important than

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.850 
I realized that's more important than
practicing<00:03:39.100> dictation<00:03:39.940> it's<00:03:40.480> very<00:03:41.170> very

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
practicing dictation it's very very

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.410 
practicing dictation it's very very
crucial<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:43.799> we<00:03:44.799> as<00:03:45.070> stenographers<00:03:45.790> have

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
crucial that we as stenographers have

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.140 
crucial that we as stenographers have
our<00:03:46.720> theory<00:03:47.350> mastered<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.310> every<00:03:48.610> concept

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
our theory mastered in every concept

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.400 
our theory mastered in every concept
mastered<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.970> conclusion<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.660> came<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
mastered so the conclusion I came to the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.630 
mastered so the conclusion I came to the
revelation<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.280> had<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:56.070> whenever<00:03:57.070> we<00:03:57.370> a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
revelation I had is that whenever we a

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.600 
revelation I had is that whenever we a
stenographer<00:03:58.150> z'<00:03:58.510> are<00:03:58.810> practicing<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.829> order

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
stenographer z' are practicing in order

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.110 
stenographer z' are practicing in order
to<00:04:00.820> improve<00:04:01.209> our<00:04:01.420> skill<00:04:02.610> whenever<00:04:03.610> we<00:04:03.880> see

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
to improve our skill whenever we see

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.650 
to improve our skill whenever we see
whenever<00:04:04.720> we<00:04:04.900> come<00:04:05.049> across<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.709> word<00:04:05.980> or<00:04:06.459> phrase

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
whenever we come across a word or phrase

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.360 
whenever we come across a word or phrase
that<00:04:07.660> causes<00:04:08.049> us<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.200> hesitate<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:09.100> drop

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that causes us to hesitate to drop

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.289 
that causes us to hesitate to drop
whatever<00:04:09.760> causes<00:04:10.450> any<00:04:10.630> form<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.260> difficulty

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
whatever causes any form of difficulty

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.080 
whatever causes any form of difficulty
most<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.570> time<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:14.200> not<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.700> one

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
most of the time it's not just that one

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.719 
most of the time it's not just that one
word<00:04:16.390> or<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.900> one<00:04:17.229> freeze<00:04:17.590> usually<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
word or that one freeze usually the

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.409 
word or that one freeze usually the
problem<00:04:19.000> runs<00:04:19.479> deeper<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:21.729> you<00:04:22.090> realize

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
problem runs deeper and if you realize

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.130 
problem runs deeper and if you realize
that<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.560> problem<00:04:24.010> runs<00:04:24.220> deeper<00:04:24.789> we<00:04:25.750> have<00:04:25.960> to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
that the problem runs deeper we have to

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.730 
that the problem runs deeper we have to
fix<00:04:26.349> that

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
fix that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.070 
fix that
you<00:04:26.830> have<00:04:27.039> to<00:04:27.190> fix<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.729> you<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.720> go<00:04:28.870> back

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
you have to fix that you have to go back

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.710 
you have to fix that you have to go back
to<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.650> fundamentals<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.550> actually<00:04:31.150> master

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
to the fundamentals and actually master

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.600 
to the fundamentals and actually master
that<00:04:31.930> concept<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:33.720> what<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.750> would<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.139> is<00:04:35.610> like

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
that concept so what I would do is like

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.920 
that concept so what I would do is like
I<00:04:36.639> explained<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:38.759> go<00:04:39.759> back<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.389> book<00:04:40.539> go

been<00:04:48.970> introduced<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.490> find<00:04:51.490> high

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
been introduced to it then find high

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.439 
been introduced to it then find high
frequency<00:04:52.539> words<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:53.620> are<00:04:54.090> part<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.270> the

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
frequency words that are part of the

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.710 
frequency words that are part of the
same<00:04:55.720> concept<00:04:56.910> practice<00:04:57.910> those<00:04:58.210> drilled

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
same concept practice those drilled

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.290 
same concept practice those drilled
those<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.440> if<00:05:00.009> you<00:05:00.039> realize<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.699> it's

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
those and if you realize that it's

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.649 
those and if you realize that it's
dexterity<00:05:02.259> issue<00:05:02.470> after<00:05:03.009> all<00:05:03.159> that<00:05:03.659> create

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
dexterity issue after all that create

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.930 
dexterity issue after all that create
finger<00:05:05.080> drills<00:05:05.289> or<00:05:05.500> find<00:05:05.800> finger<00:05:06.159> drills<00:05:06.460> that

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
finger drills or find finger drills that

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.189 
finger drills or find finger drills that
emphasize<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.810> key<00:05:08.080> combination<00:05:09.060> now

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
emphasize that key combination now

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.399 
emphasize that key combination now
another<00:05:11.199> thing<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:11.560> would<00:05:11.620> suggest<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:13.409> the

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
another thing I would suggest is the

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.379 
another thing I would suggest is the
next<00:05:14.710> day<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.220> maybe<00:05:15.520> two<00:05:15.880> or<00:05:16.030> three<00:05:16.210> days

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
next day and maybe two or three days

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.330 
next day and maybe two or three days
later<00:05:16.659> again<00:05:17.169> is<00:05:17.940> go<00:05:18.940> through<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.270> chapter

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
later again is go through that chapter

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.770 
later again is go through that chapter
go<00:05:21.340> through<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.669> concept<00:05:22.180> for<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.419> little<00:05:22.630> bit

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
go through that concept for a little bit

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.180 
go through that concept for a little bit
doesn't<00:05:23.110> have<00:05:23.199> to<00:05:23.289> be<00:05:23.380> forever<00:05:23.530> it<00:05:23.979> could<00:05:24.099> be

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
doesn't have to be forever it could be

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.059 
doesn't have to be forever it could be
five<00:05:24.400> minutes<00:05:25.380> maybe<00:05:26.380> go<00:05:26.620> through<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.919> list

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
five minutes maybe go through the list

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.810 
five minutes maybe go through the list
if<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.370> feel<00:05:27.550> they<00:05:27.699> need<00:05:28.199> but<00:05:29.820> definitely

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
if you feel they need but definitely

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.760 
if you feel they need but definitely
definitely<00:05:31.210> definitely<00:05:31.930> do<00:05:32.409> the<00:05:32.590> finger

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
definitely definitely do the finger

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.430 
definitely definitely do the finger
