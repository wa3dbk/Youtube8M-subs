00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.560 
gonna do feel miracle tree the river but
then<00:00:32.199> I<00:00:32.379> decided<00:00:32.769> to<00:00:32.890> do<00:00:33.100> this<00:00:33.160> Bali<00:00:33.460> eight<00:00:33.699> and

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
then I decided to do this Bali eight and

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.040 
then I decided to do this Bali eight and
I<00:00:34.629> don't<00:00:34.690> have<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:35.050> very<00:00:35.199> big<00:00:35.290> space<00:00:36.750> fence<00:00:37.750> here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
I don't have a very big space fence here

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
I don't have a very big space fence here
and<00:00:38.080> it's<00:00:38.620> tons<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.160> light<00:00:39.400> so<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:40.059> think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and it's tons of the light so I think

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660 
and it's tons of the light so I think
so<00:00:42.470> you're<00:00:43.470> just<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.040> started

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so you're just about to get started

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
so you're just about to get started
I<00:00:44.700> brought<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.450> home<00:00:45.630> yesterday<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.710> they

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I brought these home yesterday and they

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.049 
I brought these home yesterday and they
come<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> bag

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
come in a bag

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.210 
come in a bag
thought<00:00:49.059> best<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:50.079> before<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.770> got<00:00:50.950> started

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
thought best so before I got started

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.040 
thought best so before I got started
this<00:00:51.460> morning<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.880> filled<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.329> bag<00:00:52.510> up<00:00:52.750> with

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
this morning I filled the bag up with

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.530 
this morning I filled the bag up with
water<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.700> roots<00:00:54.910> could<00:00:55.149> get<00:00:55.300> really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
water so that the roots could get really

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.069 
water so that the roots could get really
soaked<00:00:55.930> in<00:00:56.940> Hui<00:00:57.940> position<00:00:58.510> them<00:00:58.660> along<00:00:58.900> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
soaked in Hui position them along the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.080 
soaked in Hui position them along the
fence<00:00:59.290> so<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.309> kind<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.550> know<00:01:00.730> where<00:01:00.940> we're

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
fence so you kind of know where we're

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.160 
fence so you kind of know where we're
gonna<00:01:01.180> dig<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.720> holes

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.080 

I<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.860> pretty<00:01:07.130> big<00:01:07.340> space<00:01:07.610> where<00:01:07.850> they<00:01:07.939> can

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
I have a pretty big space where they can

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.380 
I have a pretty big space where they can
grow<00:01:08.270> along<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.750> fence<00:01:08.990> but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
grow along the fence but

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.540 
grow along the fence but
I<00:01:10.420> guess<00:01:11.050> having<00:01:11.290> at<00:01:11.530> least<00:01:11.680> three<00:01:12.070> feet<00:01:12.310> on

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
I guess having at least three feet on

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.110 
I guess having at least three feet on
either<00:01:12.790> end<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.870> good<00:01:14.370> spacing<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.970> give

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
either end it's a good spacing to give

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.150 
either end it's a good spacing to give
them<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.360> space<00:01:16.480> to<00:01:16.630> grow<00:01:16.990> out<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.590> then<00:01:18.040> I'm

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
them the space to grow out and then I'm

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.460 
them the space to grow out and then I'm
gonna<00:01:18.280> have<00:01:18.490> about<00:01:18.700> three<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.450> four<00:01:19.840> cents

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
gonna have about three to four cents

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.140 
gonna have about three to four cents
actually<00:01:20.590> more<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.070> four<00:01:21.310> feet<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:21.760> between

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
actually more like four feet in between

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.410 
actually more like four feet in between
the<00:01:22.300> trees<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:22.900> no<00:01:23.050> space

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.740 

we're<00:01:27.170> going<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.380> do<00:01:27.530> her<00:01:27.830> about<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.790> size<00:01:29.510> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
we're going to do her about the size of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
we're going to do her about the size of
the<00:01:29.960> roots<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.710> roots<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.190> lay<00:01:32.060> out

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.389 

all<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.289> learning<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:41.130> here

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
all right so the big learning right here

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.100 
all right so the big learning right here
is<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> hole<00:01:42.149> that<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.539> didn't<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
is that the hole that you didn't have to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.429 
is that the hole that you didn't have to
be<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:44.130> lighter<00:01:44.789> than<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
be the lighter than you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.450 
be the lighter than you
at<00:01:46.770> least<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.159> me

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.280 

I'd<00:01:52.640> enough<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.240> we<00:01:53.479> could<00:01:53.659> spread<00:01:53.990> up

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
I'd enough so that we could spread up

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.250 
I'd enough so that we could spread up
the<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.119> roots<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.690> they<00:01:56.810> could<00:01:56.960> be<00:01:57.110> going

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the the roots and they could be going

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.050 
the the roots and they could be going
out<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.830> direction<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.729> they're<00:01:58.880> going

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
out this direction that they're going

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.420 
out this direction that they're going
rather<00:01:59.510> than<00:01:59.810> like<00:01:59.990> curling<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.010> towards<00:02:01.310> each

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
rather than like curling in towards each

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.200 
rather than like curling in towards each
other<00:02:01.900> being<00:02:02.900> smashed<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.680> we<00:02:04.520> don't<00:02:04.729> super

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
other being smashed so we don't super

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.949 
other being smashed so we don't super
wide<00:02:05.420> wall<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:07.400> then<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.060> other<00:02:08.240> goal<00:02:08.539> was<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
wide wall and then the other goal was to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.340 
wide wall and then the other goal was to
get<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:11.270> tree<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:14.180> went<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:15.140> meet<00:02:15.290> up

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
get the tree to be you went to meet up

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350 
get the tree to be you went to meet up
with<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> soil<00:02:15.980> line<00:02:16.250> where<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.819> crown<00:02:17.090> is

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
with the soil line where the crown is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.620 
with the soil line where the crown is
for<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.720> roots<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:19.580> meet<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> trunk

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
for the roots you meet the trunk

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.630 
for the roots you meet the trunk
you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.780> what<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.110> part<00:02:21.410> underneath<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
you know what this part underneath the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.800 
you know what this part underneath the
soil<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:24.350> did<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.560> huge<00:02:24.830> wide<00:02:25.280> hole<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.120> then

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
soil so we did a huge wide hole and then

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.360 
soil so we did a huge wide hole and then
kind<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.170> mound<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.590> up<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.830> soil<00:02:28.070> in<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
kind of mound it up the soil in the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.759 
kind of mound it up the soil in the
middle<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.570> we're<00:02:29.810> setting<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.380> tree<00:02:30.620> on

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
middle and we're setting the tree on

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.100 
middle and we're setting the tree on
there<00:02:31.040> where<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:32.380> looks<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.980> good<00:02:34.250> level

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
there where it looks to be a good level

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.630 
there where it looks to be a good level
with<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> soil<00:02:36.560> line<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.519> we're

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
with the soil line and then we're

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.530 
with the soil line and then we're
spreading<00:02:38.000> out<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.390> roots<00:02:39.910> carefully<00:02:40.910> down

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
spreading out the roots carefully down

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.360 
spreading out the roots carefully down
around<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.200> mound<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.739> then<00:02:43.130> we're<00:02:43.280> gonna

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
around that mound and then we're gonna

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.390 
around that mound and then we're gonna
fill<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:44.110> around<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:46.100> roots<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.890> tricky

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
fill in around the roots so the tricky

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.790 
fill in around the roots so the tricky
part<00:02:49.640> about<00:02:49.730> espalier<00:02:50.690> trees<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.620> you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
part about espalier trees is that you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.470 
part about espalier trees is that you
want<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.220> be<00:02:52.370> close<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.940> fence

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
want it to be close to the fence

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.280 
want it to be close to the fence
so<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:55.340> had<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.640> kind<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.910> find<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:57.110> right

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
so we had to kind of find the right

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.259 
so we had to kind of find the right
position<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.070> put<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> tree<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.940> know<00:02:59.060> this

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
position to put the tree you know this

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.270 
position to put the tree you know this
way<00:02:59.480> or<00:02:59.660> flip<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.989> around<00:03:00.079> or<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.010> could<00:03:01.160> get

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
way or flip it around or we could get

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.220 
way or flip it around or we could get
lots<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> roots

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.259 

and<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.500> much<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.890> under<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> fence<00:03:06.640> or<00:03:06.909> in

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
and so much going under the fence or in

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.210 
and so much going under the fence or in
other<00:03:07.599> directions<00:03:07.930> as<00:03:08.319> we<00:03:08.470> could<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:08.980> in

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
other directions as we could but in

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.119 
other directions as we could but in
order<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.760> trellis<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.629> train<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.650> branches

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
order to trellis and train the branches

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.490 
order to trellis and train the branches
we<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.610> get<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.909> against<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.019> fence<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
we have to get it against a fence so I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.679 
we have to get it against a fence so I
think<00:03:14.620> that's<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.099> trickiest<00:03:15.489> part<00:03:15.849> I'm

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
think that's the trickiest part I'm

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.819 
think that's the trickiest part I'm
gonna<00:03:16.840> think<00:03:17.049> with<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.290> Apple<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.739> the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
gonna think with the Apple and the

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.589 
gonna think with the Apple and the
cherry<00:03:18.069> tree<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.459> figured<00:03:18.730> out<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.390> best

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
cherry tree to figured out the best

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.380 
cherry tree to figured out the best
direction<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.819> most<00:03:21.819> of<00:03:21.939> the<00:03:22.030> roots<00:03:22.209> are

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
direction and most of the roots are

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.130 
direction and most of the roots are
going<00:03:22.569> out<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:24.250> think<00:03:25.209> already<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.659> fill<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.049> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
going out I think already to fill in the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.130 
going out I think already to fill in the
hole<00:03:28.109> okay<00:03:29.189> so

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
hole okay so

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.350 
hole okay so
got<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.740> trees<00:03:31.950> planted<00:03:32.490> that's<00:03:33.030> pretty

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
got the trees planted that's pretty

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.140 
got the trees planted that's pretty
awesome<00:03:33.510> ended<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.740> what<00:03:35.580> seems<00:03:35.910> like

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
awesome ended up with what seems like

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.750 
awesome ended up with what seems like
way<00:03:36.360> more<00:03:36.390> soil<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:38.070> they've<00:03:38.220> had<00:03:38.370> before<00:03:38.550> but

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.920 

but<00:03:43.360> that'll<00:03:43.900> settle<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.379> so

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.490 

we're<00:03:47.930> doing<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> travelers<00:03:48.739> part<00:03:49.069> now<00:03:49.310> so

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
we're doing the travelers part now so

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:23.140 
we're doing the travelers part now so
we're<00:03:51.500> starting<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.010> first<00:03:52.569> wire

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.810 

about<00:04:24.230> inches<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.770> measured<00:04:26.100> that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
about inches so that we measured that

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.500 
about inches so that we measured that
distance<00:04:27.660> up<00:04:27.930> from<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.800> post<00:04:29.180> for<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.270> first

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
distance up from the post for the first

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.170 
distance up from the post for the first
and<00:04:31.440> then<00:04:32.400> these<00:04:32.580> will<00:04:32.820> be

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.740 

connected<00:04:36.990> with<00:04:37.020> twin<00:04:37.500> oh<00:04:37.800> it's<00:04:38.280> fine<00:04:38.820> in

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
connected with twin oh it's fine in

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.560 
connected with twin oh it's fine in
order<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.169> create<00:04:40.530> horizontal<00:04:41.280> limbs<00:04:42.180> along

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
order to create horizontal limbs along

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.780 
order to create horizontal limbs along
that<00:04:42.780> wire<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.800> Nomo<00:04:44.040> treaty<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.520> will

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
that wire and Nomo treaty that will

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.879 
that wire and Nomo treaty that will
measure<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.840> distance<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.470> next<00:04:46.740> one

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
measure the distance that the next one

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.060 
measure the distance that the next one
will<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.250> be<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.990> will<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.710> training

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
will have to be and I will be training

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:59.719 
will have to be and I will be training
these<00:04:50.400> limbs<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.419> log<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:53.040> second<00:04:58.729> all

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
these limbs I get the log the second all

00:04:59.729 --> 00:04:59.930 
these limbs I get the log the second all
right

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
right

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.140 
right
so<00:05:01.490> pretty<00:05:02.490> much<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.970> trellis<00:05:03.419> up<00:05:04.320> and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
so pretty much have the trellis up and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.839 
so pretty much have the trellis up and
almost<00:05:06.150> completed<00:05:06.780> ready<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.949> couple

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.999 

there

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.760 

here

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.100 

so<00:05:22.129> we<00:05:22.879> had<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.150> upgrade<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.810> thicker

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
so we had to upgrade to a thicker

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.080 
so we had to upgrade to a thicker
thicker<00:05:26.740> bolts<00:05:27.129> and<00:05:27.310> we<00:05:27.400> went<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:27.639> stainless

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
thicker bolts and we went with stainless

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.450 
thicker bolts and we went with stainless
steel<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:28.659> said<00:05:28.840> if<00:05:28.990> they<00:05:29.409> completed<00:05:29.770> -<00:05:30.189> and

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
steel and said if they completed - and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.670 
steel and said if they completed - and
that<00:05:31.210> seemed<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.509> work<00:05:31.629> better<00:05:31.990> but<00:05:33.240> basically

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
that seemed to work better but basically

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.040 
that seemed to work better but basically
put<00:05:35.680> an<00:05:35.889> eyebolt<00:05:36.699> in<00:05:37.000> one<00:05:37.270> post<00:05:37.569> on<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> other

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
put an eyebolt in one post on the other

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.959 
put an eyebolt in one post on the other
and<00:05:38.439> then<00:05:38.590> tried<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.889> get<00:05:39.069> the<00:05:39.159> wire<00:05:39.370> as<00:05:39.669> taut

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
and then tried to get the wire as taut

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.290 
and then tried to get the wire as taut
as<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.240> could<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:41.430> we<00:05:42.430> spaced<00:05:42.759> out<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:43.090> wire

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
as you could and we spaced out the wire

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
as you could and we spaced out the wire
based<00:05:43.629> on<00:05:43.840> where<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.139> branches<00:05:44.590> work

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.300 

and<00:05:50.320> then<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:51.460> used<00:05:52.000> some<00:05:52.120> twine<00:05:52.510> to<00:05:52.840> loosely

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
and then I used some twine to loosely

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.630 
and then I used some twine to loosely
tie<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.370> branch<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.420> wire<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.640> I'm

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
tie the branch to the wire so I'm

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.710 
tie the branch to the wire so I'm
training<00:05:58.360> them<00:05:58.860> to<00:05:59.860> grow<00:06:00.480> horizontally<00:06:01.480> along

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
training them to grow horizontally along

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.100 
training them to grow horizontally along
the<00:06:01.930> wire

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
the wire

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.020 
the wire
hey<00:06:05.110> we're<00:06:05.260> kind<00:06:05.440> of<00:06:05.500> going<00:06:05.770> up<00:06:05.890> that<00:06:06.160> way<00:06:06.370> so<00:06:06.550> a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
hey we're kind of going up that way so a

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.650 
hey we're kind of going up that way so a
little<00:06:07.870> bit<00:06:08.050> of<00:06:09.030> kind<00:06:10.030> of<00:06:10.150> fitting<00:06:10.390> a<00:06:10.420> little

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
little bit of kind of fitting a little

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.130 
little bit of kind of fitting a little
bit<00:06:10.750> of<00:06:10.870> pressure<00:06:11.050> on<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.440> branch<00:06:11.680> but<00:06:13.140> it

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
bit of pressure on the branch but it

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.610 
bit of pressure on the branch but it
seems<00:06:14.440> like<00:06:14.710> it's<00:06:15.480> it'll<00:06:16.480> be<00:06:16.600> good<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.750> I<00:06:19.780> think

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
seems like it's it'll be good so I think

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.790 
seems like it's it'll be good so I think
we're<00:06:20.980> just<00:06:21.160> about<00:06:21.280> there<00:06:22.380> we<00:06:23.380> just<00:06:23.560> need<00:06:23.710> to

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
we're just about there we just need to

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.170 
we're just about there we just need to
make<00:06:23.920> sure<00:06:23.980> that<00:06:24.160> we<00:06:24.400> water<00:06:24.610> this<00:06:24.880> really

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
make sure that we water this really

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.210 
make sure that we water this really
deeply<00:06:25.920> and

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.330 

the<00:06:29.760> last<00:06:29.970> branch
