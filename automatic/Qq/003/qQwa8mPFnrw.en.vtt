thing<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.890> reason<00:00:29.640> why<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> mastering<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> next

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
thing the reason why I mastering it next

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.049 
thing the reason why I mastering it next
is<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.369> don't<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.430> why<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.940> just

think that if I have maximum wo it'll be

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
think that if I have maximum wo it'll be
a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.579> bit<00:00:35.670> easier<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.239> into<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
a little bit easier to get into some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.350 
a little bit easier to get into some
parties<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.370> don't<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:38.969> will

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

damage a one-percent chance i think that

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.280 
damage a one-percent chance i think that
when<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.200> happens<00:02:53.850> d<00:02:54.850> damage<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.330> blue<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:55.959> gray

when it happens d damage in blue or gray

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.370 
when it happens d damage in blue or gray
I<00:02:56.350> think<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:56.680> green<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.720> damage<00:02:59.050> comes<00:02:59.260> in

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
I think it's green the damage comes in

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.750 
I think it's green the damage comes in
green<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.620> think<00:03:00.010> that's<00:03:00.160> what<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.400> I'm<00:03:00.610> not

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
green I think that's what it is I'm not

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.430 
green I think that's what it is I'm not
one<00:03:00.850> hundred<00:03:00.910> percent<00:03:01.090> sure<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:02.319> know<00:03:02.410> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
one hundred percent sure you know I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.979 
one hundred percent sure you know I
haven't<00:03:03.100> found<00:03:03.670> any<00:03:04.000> proof<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.900> or

haven't found any proof on it or

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.949 
haven't found any proof on it or
anything<00:03:05.050> but<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:07.030> thinking<00:03:07.569> that's<00:03:07.660> what<00:03:07.810> it

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
anything but I'm thinking that's what it

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.660 
anything but I'm thinking that's what it
is<00:03:08.080> because<00:03:08.260> I've<00:03:08.470> never<00:03:08.650> seen<00:03:08.950> I've<00:03:09.190> never

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
is because I've never seen I've never

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.180 
is because I've never seen I've never
seen<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.420> could<00:03:10.720> an<00:03:10.930> actual<00:03:11.200> damage<00:03:11.739> increase

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
seen I could an actual damage increase

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.040 
seen I could an actual damage increase
it's<00:03:12.819> not<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.209> pay<00:03:13.450> attention<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.930> my

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
it's not like a pay attention to my

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.750 
it's not like a pay attention to my
damage<00:03:14.410> while<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:14.980> trained<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.489> be<00:03:15.580> quite

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
damage while I trained to be quite

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.979 
damage while I trained to be quite
honest<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:17.799> recently<00:03:18.190> um<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.720> I've<00:03:19.840> been

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
honest like recently um what I've been

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.840 
honest like recently um what I've been
doing<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.500> not<00:03:20.950> even<00:03:21.220> caring<00:03:21.430> about<00:03:21.640> my

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
doing is just not even caring about my

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.750 
get it because it's based on when you
get<00:05:38.960> attacked<00:05:39.290> actually<00:05:40.130> but<00:05:40.280> it's<00:05:40.460> based<00:05:40.670> on

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
get attacked actually but it's based on

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.480 
get attacked actually but it's based on
when<00:05:40.910> you'll<00:05:41.030> Boyd<00:05:41.300> an<00:05:41.450> attack<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:43.280> very

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
when you'll Boyd an attack so it's very

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.210 
when you'll Boyd an attack so it's very
rare<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:44.150> think<00:05:44.510> it's<00:05:44.630> just<00:05:44.930> as<00:05:45.710> where<00:05:45.920> is<00:05:46.070> the

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
rare I think it's just as where is the

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.160 
rare I think it's just as where is the
one<00:05:46.370> person<00:05:46.550> critical<00:05:47.030> chance<00:05:47.210> thing<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.870> it

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
one person critical chance thing and it

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.450 
one person critical chance thing and it
only<00:05:48.290> lasts<00:05:48.530> for<00:05:48.620> eight<00:05:48.800> seconds<00:05:49.190> I'm<00:05:49.280> not

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
only lasts for eight seconds I'm not

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.400 
only lasts for eight seconds I'm not
really<00:05:49.550> sure<00:05:49.670> what<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.090> bolts<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.450> does<00:05:50.630> uh

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
really sure what the bolts it does uh

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.290 
really sure what the bolts it does uh
three<00:05:52.280> percent<00:05:52.580> less<00:05:52.730> damage<00:05:53.060> for<00:05:53.210> eight

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
three percent less damage for eight

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.820 
three percent less damage for eight
seconds<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.840> eight<00:05:53.960> seconds<00:05:54.350> i<00:05:54.410> believe<00:05:54.650> it's

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
seconds the eight seconds i believe it's

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.010 
seconds the eight seconds i believe it's
always<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.190> duration<00:05:55.700> of<00:05:55.790> eight<00:05:55.910> seconds<00:05:56.330> just

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
always a duration of eight seconds just

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.110 
always a duration of eight seconds just
the<00:05:57.230> UH<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.830> percent<00:05:58.550> chance<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:59.000> does

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
the UH the percent chance it does

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.110 
the UH the percent chance it does
increase<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.690> think<00:06:00.320> max<00:06:00.530> level<00:06:00.770> is<00:06:00.920> 30<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:01.550> when

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
increase I think max level is 30 so when

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.800 
increase I think max level is 30 so when
it's<00:06:02.270> mastered<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.810> think<00:06:03.020> it's<00:06:03.370> 35<00:06:04.510> either<00:06:05.510> 30

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
it's mastered I think it's 35 either 30

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.810 
it's mastered I think it's 35 either 30
yeah<00:06:06.200> 30<00:06:06.380> five<00:06:06.620> percenter<00:06:07.070> I<00:06:07.250> believe<00:06:07.670> it's

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
yeah 30 five percenter I believe it's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.100 
yeah 30 five percenter I believe it's
thirty-five<00:06:08.240> percent<00:06:08.360> chance<00:06:08.720> which<00:06:08.990> is

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
thirty-five percent chance which is

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.740 
thirty-five percent chance which is
really<00:06:10.070> high<00:06:10.280> but<00:06:10.550> anyways<00:06:11.240> um<00:06:11.450> i'm<00:06:11.690> just

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
really high but anyways um i'm just
