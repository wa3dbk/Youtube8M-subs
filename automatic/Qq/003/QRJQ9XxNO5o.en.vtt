compound situations they're there I have

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.479 
compound situations they're there I have
a<00:03:18.260> lot<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.560> very<00:03:18.709> strong<00:03:18.950> opinions<00:03:19.400> about

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
a lot of very strong opinions about

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.520 
a lot of very strong opinions about
about<00:03:19.910> those<00:03:20.120> without<00:03:20.600> those<00:03:20.840> types<00:03:21.350> of

about those without those types of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.080 
about those without those types of

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
situations which I think are very wrong

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.479 
situations which I think are very wrong
and<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.420> think<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.930> know<00:03:24.489> governments

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.830 
and I think that you know governments
should<00:03:25.640> do<00:03:25.790> some<00:03:25.970> our<00:03:26.150> government<00:03:26.570> should<00:03:26.600> do

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
should do some our government should do

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.970 
should do some our government should do
something<00:03:27.170> about<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.560> because<00:03:27.709> these<00:03:27.770> women

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
something about it because these women

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.550 
something about it because these women
are<00:03:28.220> kept<00:03:28.489> extremely<00:03:28.970> repressed<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.870> they
