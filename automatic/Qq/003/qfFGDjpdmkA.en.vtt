show you exactly how I'm going to load
my<00:00:22.920> core<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:24.359> I'm<00:00:24.510> doing<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
my core and what I'm doing is what I

call fishing the balls out fish and the
feed<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:29.340> probably<00:00:29.670> cats<00:00:29.849> two<00:00:30.179> three

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
feed out my probably cats two three

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.100 
feed out my probably cats two three
maybe<00:00:30.750> four<00:00:31.019> fish<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> same<00:00:31.949> ball<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.399> feed

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
maybe four fish on the same ball of feed

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
maybe four fish on the same ball of feed
without<00:00:34.110> having<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> top<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:36.120> all

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
without having to top off so what all

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
without having to top off so what all
I'm<00:00:36.420> doing<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.050> literally<00:00:37.770> getting<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> pinch

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I'm doing is literally getting a pinch

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
I'm doing is literally getting a pinch
of<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.270> mil<00:00:39.480> pellets<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.110> probably

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of our two mil pellets it's probably

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
of our two mil pellets it's probably
about<00:00:40.500> 40<00:00:41.040> there<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.270> actually

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
about 40 there but that will actually

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
about 40 there but that will actually
hold<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.170> fish<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.739> groundbait<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.820> great

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
hold the fish the groundbait is great

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.400 
hold the fish the groundbait is great
for<00:00:45.600> drawing<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> fish<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> literally<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.899> mix

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
for drawing the fish so literally I mix

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
for drawing the fish so literally I mix
them<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.059> get<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> pinch<00:00:51.649> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them up like that get a pinch and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
them up like that get a pinch and
squeeze<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:53.520> once<00:00:54.239> twice<00:00:55.079> three<00:00:56.070> times

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
squeeze out once twice three times

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.740 
squeeze out once twice three times
it<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> quite<00:00:58.440> solid<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.390> pelvis

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it is quite solid you can see the pelvis

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
it is quite solid you can see the pelvis
in<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> solid<00:01:02.789> ball<00:01:03.030> hits<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
in there when that solid ball hits the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
in there when that solid ball hits the
bottom<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.559> disperse<00:01:05.040> very<00:01:05.250> very

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
bottom it will disperse very very

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.030 
bottom it will disperse very very
quickly<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.990> any<00:01:07.290> other<00:01:07.500> groundbait

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
quickly not like any other groundbait

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.940 
quickly not like any other groundbait
which<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.520> perform<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> nugget<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
which will perform a nugget like that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.200 
which will perform a nugget like that
and<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> could<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> bottom

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and it could be like that on the bottom

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.440 
and it could be like that on the bottom
for<00:01:12.299> some<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.490> bolt<00:01:15.299> my

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
for some time so I do actually bolt my

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:25.260 
for some time so I do actually bolt my
cup

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.109 

hear<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.990> pop<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.429> hear<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.729> pop<00:01:27.909> like

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
hear that pop if you hear the pop like

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.760 
hear that pop if you hear the pop like
that<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.810> gives<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.079> an<00:01:29.170> indication<00:01:29.590> that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
that that gives you an indication that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.980 
that that gives you an indication that
the<00:01:29.950> consistency<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.729> correct<00:01:31.119> because<00:01:31.689> it's

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
the consistency is correct because it's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.919 
the consistency is correct because it's
quite<00:01:32.170> hard<00:01:32.439> ball<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:34.210> I'm<00:01:34.390> using<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.750> ball

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
quite hard ball because I'm using a ball

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.410 
quite hard ball because I'm using a ball
trick<00:01:35.259> today<00:01:35.590> I'm<00:01:36.280> using<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.579> four<00:01:36.789> before<00:01:37.119> tune

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
trick today I'm using a four before tune

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.959 
trick today I'm using a four before tune
float<00:01:37.810> which<00:01:38.020> I'd<00:01:38.979> say<00:01:39.039> quite<00:01:39.429> heavy

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
float which I'd say quite heavy

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.529 
float which I'd say quite heavy
basically<00:01:40.929> settle<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.579> most<00:01:42.789> my<00:01:43.000> bulk<00:01:43.270> there

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
basically settle but most my bulk there

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.270 
basically settle but most my bulk there
that<00:01:44.380> will<00:01:44.530> there<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.250> ball<00:01:45.490> will<00:01:45.880> get

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that will there that that ball will get

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.789 
that will there that that ball will get
my<00:01:48.280> hot<00:01:48.490> baits<00:01:48.789> down<00:01:49.360> very<00:01:49.869> very<00:01:49.929> quickly<00:01:50.380> then

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
my hot baits down very very quickly then

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.309 
my hot baits down very very quickly then
using<00:01:51.189> soft<00:01:51.429> focus<00:01:51.819> today<00:01:52.149> you'll<00:01:52.600> notice<00:01:53.110> how

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
using soft focus today you'll notice how

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.309 
using soft focus today you'll notice how
I<00:01:53.350> actually<00:01:54.189> put<00:01:54.549> them<00:01:54.700> on<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.969> hop<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.479> will

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
I actually put them on the hop I will

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.330 
I actually put them on the hop I will
not<00:01:56.560> use<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.369> hook<00:01:58.140> into<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.770> pellets<00:02:00.130> I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
not use the hook into the the pellets I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.569 
not use the hook into the the pellets I
will<00:02:00.819> literally<00:02:01.239> just<00:02:01.709> hook<00:02:02.709> the<00:02:02.979> point<00:02:03.250> on

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
will literally just hook the point on

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.009 
will literally just hook the point on
turn<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:06.159> pellet<00:02:06.579> on<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.239> hook<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.750> it's

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
turn the pellet on to the hook and it's

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.600 
turn the pellet on to the hook and it's
literally<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.470> threading<00:02:09.039> itself<00:02:09.399> up

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
literally just threading itself up

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.789 
literally just threading itself up
without<00:02:09.880> weakening<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.780> pellets<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.530> that
