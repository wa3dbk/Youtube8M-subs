Lions Panthers Ravens Redskins Texans
and<00:02:26.969> Titans<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:27.329> they<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.569> feature

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and Titans because they all feature

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.170 
and Titans because they all feature
young<00:02:28.200> quarterbacks<00:02:28.769> with<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.609> exception<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
young quarterbacks with the exception of

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.640

the<00:02:30.359> Texans<00:02:30.719> and<00:02:30.840> Titans<00:02:31.109> that's<00:02:31.349> their

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the Texans and Titans that's their

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.140 
the Texans and Titans that's their
divisional<00:02:32.159> opponent<00:02:32.639> so<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> figured<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
divisional opponent so I figured that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.000 
divisional opponent so I figured that
you<00:02:33.239> would<00:02:33.299> want<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> play<00:02:33.659> them<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.859> is<00:02:34.980> like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you would want to play them this is like

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.410 
you would want to play them this is like
a<00:02:35.129> young<00:02:35.370> quarterback<00:02:35.670> file<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.299> get

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
a young quarterback file so you get

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.369 
a young quarterback file so you get
Andrew<00:02:36.659> Luck<00:02:36.870> versus<00:02:37.230> rg3<00:02:37.739> which<00:02:37.889> is<00:02:38.040> good

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
Andrew Luck versus rg3 which is good

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379 
Andrew Luck versus rg3 which is good
which<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.439> fun<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.099> all<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:42.329> are

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
which is fun and all of these are

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.159

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
different so as you can see what more

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.589 
different so as you can see what more
Minnesota<00:02:46.169> plays<00:02:46.530> 49ers<00:02:47.280> bears<00:02:47.549> Eagles<00:02:47.969> Lions
