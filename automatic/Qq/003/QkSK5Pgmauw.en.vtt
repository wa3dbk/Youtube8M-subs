a fairly exciting game there's always be
quite<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> lot<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.120> goalkeeping<00:02:55.600> errors<00:02:55.959> in

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
quite a lot of goalkeeping errors in

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.210 
quite a lot of goalkeeping errors in
recent<00:02:56.410> years<00:02:56.440> which<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.860> obviously

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
recent years which is obviously

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.220 
recent years which is obviously
fantastic<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.020> obviously

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
fantastic to see and then obviously

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290 
fantastic to see and then obviously
Chelsea<00:02:59.830> match<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.160> United<00:03:00.520> really<00:03:00.880> should

Chelsea match the United really should
be<00:03:01.450> superb<00:03:02.370> more<00:03:03.370> than<00:03:03.459> anything<00:03:03.610> else<00:03:03.880> both

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
be superb more than anything else both

teams are quite shortly defenses at
times<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.430> tends<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> mean<00:03:06.940> lots<00:03:07.209> of

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
times and that tends to mean lots of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.750 
times and that tends to mean lots of
goals<00:03:07.510> got<00:03:08.260> one<00:03:08.560> final<00:03:08.770> question<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.580> Tom
