00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.790 
way as I said before this is way too
complex<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:08.310> explain<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> one

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
complex to explain and this is one

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.600 
complex to explain and this is one
tutorial<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
tutorial you're going to have to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.810 
tutorial you're going to have to
look<00:02:12.820> at<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.720> program<00:02:14.200> itself<00:02:14.680> if<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.340> open

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
look at the program itself if you open

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.210 
look at the program itself if you open
the<00:02:15.940> puzzle<00:02:16.270> pieces<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> show<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.950> one

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the puzzle pieces just to show you one

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.670 
the puzzle pieces just to show you one
thing<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.780> use<00:02:19.780> two<00:02:21.870> objects<00:02:22.870> for<00:02:23.080> every<00:02:23.320> puzzle

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
thing I use two objects for every puzzle

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.820 
thing I use two objects for every puzzle
piece<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.700> fill<00:02:25.060> objects<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.620> read

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
piece the fill objects as you can read

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.130 
piece the fill objects as you can read
here<00:02:27.070> control<00:02:28.030> whether<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.330> not<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.690> mouse<00:02:28.900> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
here control whether or not the mouse is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.050 
here control whether or not the mouse is
touching<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.830> puzzle<00:02:30.160> piece<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.370> whether<00:02:30.880> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
touching the puzzle piece and whether it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.280 
touching the puzzle piece and whether it
lights<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.830> other<00:02:33.010> puzzle<00:02:33.460> piece<00:02:33.640> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
lights up and the other puzzle piece is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
lights up and the other puzzle piece is
determined<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.010> pick<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.430> any

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
determined is the one you pick up any

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.600 
determined is the one you pick up any
place<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:38.410> hope<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.950> figure<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.340> out

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
place and I hope you can figure this out

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.750 
place and I hope you can figure this out
once<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.810> did<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.320> never<00:02:41.740> wanted<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.130> relearn<00:02:42.520> it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
once I did I never wanted to relearn it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.370 
once I did I never wanted to relearn it
again<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.420> helped<00:02:43.660> me<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:44.020> future

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
again and it helped me out in future

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.740 
again and it helped me out in future
programs<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.040> games<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> made<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.000> good

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
programs and games that I made so good

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
programs and games that I made so good
