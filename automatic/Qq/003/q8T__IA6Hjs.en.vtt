00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 traveling is living a lot of lives in 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.600
 a single travel is to fulfill dreams all 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 the days get up without knowing where 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.980
 the sun will rise without knowing that you are going to 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.270
 Deparar the day to whom you are going to know 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 there is always a different character 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.160
 there is always a new adventure we are 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 Florence and Luke are traveling ago 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 Almost a year left from patagonia 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 argentina with the idea of â€‹â€‹being able to unite 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 america from end to end on board a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 cadillac limousine that is our house 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.739
 has in a bed a kitchen the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.420
 we have reconverted as a motorhome and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 our home has been transformed into this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 time the idea is to be able to know all 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.129
 the countries of the road and good to do 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 other people other cultures other landscapes 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 travel a little back to the origins 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.699
 make children want to get into 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 a river to climb a mountain to do all 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.239
 those things that one does when the boy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.510
 so naturally and then one goes 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.519
 losing or you're losing it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.229
 this idea was born many, many years ago 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.939
 when I was very young and always 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.280
 I had this desire to go out and give 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.360
 round the world and know a little but 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.600
 it's one of those dreams that one goes 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.090
 postponing 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.460
 in argentina of everything we left our 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.310
 life our work the family the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.380
 nephews friends and life experts 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.240
 the clocks the cell phones we left 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.970
 totally disconnected yes 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.380
 without having defined the time that was going 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.990
 to go to come back because that we have 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 almost a year as I said maybe 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 about two more years until we go back to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.649
 see in our family so 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.659
 obviously it was not an easy time but 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.610
 It's great to be able to leave everything behind and 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.290
 Going out to live on the route without knowing what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.360
 the destination holds 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.490
 5 or 6 years ago when the well-known 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.230
 flowers already started dreaming about me together 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.350
 and there it was as much more feasible and 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.750
 much easier this to be able to dream and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.430
 start to concretize it then we 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 we put a little in the campaign as to 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.119
 start 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 to finalize details is a huge challenge 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.110
 besides as a person as a couple 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.959
 because we lived 11 months ago 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.550
 inside the car instead of 2 x 2 and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.709
 we share from the moment we 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.510
 We raise until we go to bed 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.459
 absolutely everything and it's great but 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.890
 At the same time, it is not easy because there are many 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.630
 situations and obstacles that are going 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 going through that it's good to be able 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.670
 learn to overcome them together the limo 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 means a friend the third member 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.720
 of the trip is practically the relations 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.660
 public in our house in our 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.340
 home in our partner our friend 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.380
 it means a lot of things and we cross 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.510
 at 4300 meters height at the salar de uyuni 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.819
 we crossed the titicaca lake sailing in 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.110
 a little bag of wood a lot of 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.700
 situations that are not appropriate 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.680
 for this type of vehicles that are not 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.299
 done for that but it has been very 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.720
 well many times better than us like that 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.700
 which is the most offered and poor and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.530
 the image that we had a little earlier was 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 the one that runs around the world thanks to 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.700
 hollywood us to that movie thing of 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.480
 that is still young is alive giving 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 laps out there 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.400
 but travelers have a little more the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.750
 open head and we never believe in everything 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.940
 what we see on TV we knew that no 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.049
 It could be like this when we started the trip 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.580
 we started to find 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.840
 Colombians who are hanging around 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.489
 the world and we realized that they were 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.620
 excellent people that everyone 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.209
 he spoke to us very well about colombia and that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.650
 made us take more the decision of 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.349
 enter this country and go through it 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.349
 tip to tip in a car of 7 meters and 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.360
 the truth that the best impression is the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.640
 country in which we have been most secure 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.159
 felt in the whole trip if I lived my 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.020
 I from 15 years ago would be more than 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.040
 proud I think yes 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.240
 in a single word for being animated 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.580
 for being encouraged to go out and fulfill the dream 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.650
 that seemed so impossible so far away and 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.500
 totally proud as he said by 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.830
 have encouraged us to go out and give it to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.800
 forward in spite of everything and it is a 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.050
 constant teaching every day 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.710
 learn to value what one has to 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.840
 accept other people other cultures other 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.360
 to be able to adapt to other places 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.230
 other customs and without playing or 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.800
 our go as spectators 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.020
 and it's great to be able to 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.460
 although we are part of life people 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.590
 what's going on we're also a bit 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.730
 looking from the outside but it's great 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.400
 be able to adapt and without playing and accepting 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.870
 another kind of life we are not from 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.640
 give advice because we were not from 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.290
 listen to them if we had listened to 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.970
 advice we would now be working on 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.410
 an office and we would have missed 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.750
 all this year that we have lived that has 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.040
 been incredible then the truth does not 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.660
 we would give advice to anyone simply 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.820
 Do not listen to anyone if they have a 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.200
 I dream that they come out to fulfill any 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.780
 I dream that all dreams are 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.220
 possible if one puts everything there 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.960
 that put not the soul the body and the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.090
 heart and the desire and especially if you 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.770
 accompany the love of your life is much more 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.260
 easy and much more beautiful to share 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.570
 all this so anything that 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.430
 dream for bigger and stranger than you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.590
 look forward to meet it because 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.210
 we were told it was impossible 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.840
 travel South America in a car like 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.840
 this and here we are
