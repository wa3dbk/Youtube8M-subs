00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.370
 Hello dear viewers and get displeased at cabaret many 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 I would like to introduce my work that the reduction 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.709
 these are, so to speak, Peter Thomas with paint and stencils on the skin 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.309
 brought 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.979
 and this would have you would continue to worry about something Kreher 

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:20.089
 elevates can create 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.429
 and catching up with a few small setups other than just fun 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.499
 these are mine "but they are fooling here 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.499
 So it would be a compressor 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.910
 and but it is 2 0 you should make sure that the ad hoc 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.570
 Attitude but wait 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.450
 both Stohler achieved there are also differences of a selection 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.750
 show yourself you can only with a lever 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.070
 the air supply 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.920
 regulate and turn on this to regulate the color beforehand 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.960
 then we need to leave 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.650
 best from the pharmacy 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.310
 their prototypes alcohol the pistor of the skin infection 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
 and also to cleanse Dr Gisdol 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.240
 but that's what he left talking about 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.709
 in order to be able to handle this much better 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 then we come to the colors 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.000
 I'm wrong now only three questions taken and remains the base step 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.730
 to be able to demonstrate 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.130
 You can hear that in such small containers 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.710
 and they are coming 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 yes and no the pistol lay 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670
 to the templates 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.010
 In the evening self-adhesive 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.640
 bolero 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 these are the motives 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 is very fresh 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 and when sprayed on but Inc 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.130
 that would be it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.440
 far and nawa time are the consumed man 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.980
 but can also spray on the back to make it that better again 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 keeps 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.299
 selected the launch 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.729
 How do you get it? 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
 Manufacturer in the face of rtr 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.779
 position 8 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.909
 That's all good for the skin 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.899
 it is the assurance pays 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.899
 Artist the rose completely in green 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.329
 Drive third fastest Assist 2 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.189
 3 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.039
 dpa 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.719
 Now we have to go to the contours and then it can be that something 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.489
 speaks against it 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.609
 but we do it with alcohol 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.609
 but wipe that away 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.099
 whole crowd of alcohol in Denver this water saver itself 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.639
 That may wash on October 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.639
 so impressively what the best way 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.109
 All this out, Rector Tilmann gives no evidence 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.349
 Adversaries water resistant to keep this between three and five 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 meet 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.599
 so happy was met at the sixth time there are more
