pretty<00:00:21.690> little<00:00:21.990> setup<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:23.330> pretty<00:00:24.330> simple

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
pretty little setup here pretty simple

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.200 
pretty little setup here pretty simple
it<00:00:24.690> works<00:00:24.780> off<00:00:25.020> 12<00:00:25.230> volt<00:00:25.550> total<00:00:26.550> lead<00:00:26.730> which<00:00:27.030> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it works off 12 volt total lead which is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.620 
it works off 12 volt total lead which is
here<00:00:27.780> and<00:00:28.640> that's<00:00:29.640> nice<00:00:29.880> al<00:00:30.000> insulator<00:00:30.360> there

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
here and that's nice al insulator there

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
here and that's nice al insulator there
to<00:00:30.990> keep<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.289> water<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.039> the<00:00:32.189> cap<00:00:32.369> there

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to keep the water out of the cap there

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.939 
to keep the water out of the cap there
and<00:00:32.909> then<00:00:33.120> uh<00:00:33.149> ones<00:00:34.109> on<00:00:34.289> also<00:00:34.949> coming<00:00:35.339> off<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
and then uh ones on also coming off of

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.849 
and then uh ones on also coming off of
this<00:00:37.949> larger<00:00:38.760> power<00:00:38.969> there<00:00:40.789> see<00:00:42.589> see<00:00:43.589> you<00:00:43.649> cap

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
this larger power there see see you cap

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.860 
this larger power there see see you cap
fits<00:00:44.339> on<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.550> nice<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.789> snug<00:00:45.089> all<00:00:45.749> right

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
fits on there nice and snug all right

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.629 
fits on there nice and snug all right
here's<00:00:46.229> the<00:00:46.289> mastermind<00:00:47.190> behind<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.489> whole

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:47.639 
here's the mastermind behind this whole

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:50.299 
here's the mastermind behind this whole
thing<00:00:47.670> here's<00:00:48.030> nice<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.569> electric<00:00:48.839> pump<00:00:49.309> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
thing here's nice little electric pump a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
thing here's nice little electric pump a
little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> difficulty<00:00:51.749> putting<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
little bit of difficulty putting it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
little bit of difficulty putting it
together<00:00:52.319> but<00:00:52.589> uh<00:00:52.799> took<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:53.579> filter<00:00:53.999> off<00:00:54.149> here

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
together but uh took the filter off here

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.169 
together but uh took the filter off here
and<00:00:54.809> put<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.440> line<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> base

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
and put it in line down here at the base

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.750 
and put it in line down here at the base
of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> tank<00:00:57.659> and<00:00:57.870> used<00:00:58.079> half<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.190> garden<00:00:59.519> hose

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
of the tank and used half a garden hose

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.329 
of the tank and used half a garden hose
here<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.569> mean<00:01:01.409> I<00:01:01.530> screwed<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> straight<00:01:02.190> into

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
here I mean I screwed that straight into

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.119 
here I mean I screwed that straight into
the<00:01:02.429> tank<00:01:02.729> tank<00:01:03.329> feet<00:01:03.569> here<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> had

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the tank tank feet here and then I had

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.459 
the tank tank feet here and then I had
some<00:01:05.250> trouble<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:06.229> getting<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> actual

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
some trouble with the getting the actual

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.469 
some trouble with the getting the actual
valve<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.100> stay<00:01:08.340> seated<00:01:08.579> it's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.030> held<00:01:09.360> on

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
valve to stay seated it's not held on

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.569 
valve to stay seated it's not held on
there<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.780> tight<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> insulated<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
there very tight so when it insulated it

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.370 
there very tight so when it insulated it
you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.299> put<00:01:12.539> this<00:01:12.630> nice<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:12.990> clamp<00:01:13.229> on

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you know put this nice little clamp on

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
you know put this nice little clamp on
there<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> hold<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.770> together<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.880> all

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
there to hold it together and it's all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.969 
there to hold it together and it's all
pressure<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.450> good<00:01:15.710> another<00:01:16.710> problem<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
pressure pretty good another problem I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
pressure pretty good another problem I
would<00:01:17.159> set<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.700> putting<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.149> back<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
would set up here putting the back the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.219 
would set up here putting the back the
truck<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> getting<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.530> wine<00:01:19.680> lock<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
truck is getting the wine lock as the

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.670 
truck is getting the wine lock as the
showerheads<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.460> vacuum<00:01:23.460> tight<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:25.229> allows

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
showerheads not vacuum tight in allows

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
showerheads not vacuum tight in allows
water<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.310> back<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> water<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> fall

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
water to come back in the water to fall

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
water to come back in the water to fall
back<00:01:28.020> into<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> tank<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.600> did<00:01:30.719> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
back into the tank and so what we did is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.260 
back into the tank and so what we did is
we<00:01:30.899> took<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.109> Camelback<00:01:31.920> one-way<00:01:32.759> valve<00:01:33.000> here

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we took a Camelback one-way valve here

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230 
we took a Camelback one-way valve here
and<00:01:34.070> my<00:01:35.070> head<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.520> on/off<00:01:35.759> switch<00:01:35.820> there

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and my head did the on/off switch there

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
and my head did the on/off switch there
and<00:01:36.359> I<00:01:36.450> Solano<00:01:36.719> switch<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.409> keep<00:01:37.619> line<00:01:38.100> lock

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and I Solano switch to keep line lock

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
and I Solano switch to keep line lock
from<00:01:38.490> occur<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> turn

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.249 
from occur in there so I'm going to turn
it<00:01:40.950> up

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
it up

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
it up
nice<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.439> quite<00:01:43.649> pump
