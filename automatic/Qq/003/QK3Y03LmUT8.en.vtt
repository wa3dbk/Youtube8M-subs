00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
from now I can't believe it you know
it's<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> first<00:01:22.409> shot

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it's for as I think that's a first shot

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's for as I think that's a first shot
on<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> gear<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
on of the gear and it's just a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
on of the gear and it's just a
magnificent<00:01:25.830> strike<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:27.000> couldn't<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.420> any

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
magnificent strike it couldn't get any

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
magnificent strike it couldn't get any
better<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> got<00:01:29.490> even

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
better than that but well it got even

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
better than that but well it got even
better<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.900> took<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
better still because when they took the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
better still because when they took the
lead<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.280> can't<00:01:32.820> understand<00:01:33.270> harp
