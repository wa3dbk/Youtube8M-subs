00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 road construction despite 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 be one of the most infrastructure 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.660
 common requires a large process 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 complexity 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.889
 Functional design depends on your 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.920
 qualification as a forest track 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.200
 urban highway or highway its 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.240
 geometry instead is subject to others 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.490
 conditions such as orography and 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.830
 composition of the terrain the climatology 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.890
 of the area the environmental impact and the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.990
 cost of the work usually a 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.880
 road consists of the esplanade that 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.129
 built from granular soils 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.199
 presents a regular surface and the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.360
 firm that provides traffic a 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.129
 surface suitable for rolling and that 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.579
 absorbs the charges that are derived from it 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.079
 in turn the esplanade rests on a 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.879
 series of structures with functions 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.969
 determined that constitute the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.710
 embankment the embankment is formed by 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.719
 the foundation that provides stability 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.910
 in the event that the natural terrain is 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.219
 susceptible to shifting the core 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.109
 which increases the support capacity and 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.410
 coronation that distributes the charges 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.239
 generated by traffic the firm can 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.490
 build from different types 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.610
 of materials but usually it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.619
 they build with three differentiated layers 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.360
 the sub base that is only necessary when 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.560
 the esplanade has little capacity 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.990
 support ratio 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.530
 a uniform foundation to the base the base 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 It is the main element of resistance 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.740
 absorbs vertical stress 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140
 derived from traffic loads 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.500
 It is usually built by gravel or 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.360
 granular layers the pavement absorbs 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.640
 horizontal efforts and avoids 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.939
 Landslides are usually built with 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.710
 bituminous mixtures the evacuation of 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.990
 water from the roads is a factor 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.610
 decisive to avoid accidents and to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.939
 the maintenance of the firm and the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.830
 esplanade the surface drainage is 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.390
 formed by the devices that we are 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.479
 used to seeing on the roads 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.759
 the longitudinal ones called cal cesc or 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.369
 gutters are the drain devices 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.319
 surface par excellence built to 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.240
 both sides of the road receive the 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.370
 water that slides thanks to the soft 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.010
 pavement slope 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.670
 the underground drainage is very important 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.260
 to avoid the deterioration of the esplanade 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.180
 It generally consists of tubes and layers 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.140
 inferiors of nantes that facilitate 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.140
 water circulation
