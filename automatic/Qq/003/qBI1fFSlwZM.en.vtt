00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.880
 capture card I do not have a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 catch is I use Playstation 4 of the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 same recorder after 14 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.260
 months to record the videos and I go 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.359
 teach you there how good you are 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.219
 set to microphone 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.960
 to get out your voice will not leave 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.739
 beauty then you pick up the button once 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 share 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 then you press the options button once 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 on top of that decision is to upload 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 of the video clip do it again now close 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 options and I'll trust and settings 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 of sharing and go there there 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.079
 I'll go into configure are configurations 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 of video clips and I'll have to check this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 option here includes microphone audio in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 video clip marked it ready you can already 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 leave and that's it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 Now I'll show you to get into some 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 game to show how to record 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.439
 because it is also worth remembering that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 playstation 4 it does not record it is 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.090
 playstation 4 recorder it only records 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 inside the games it does not record 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 is the part of the video game menu that was 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.880
 That part that I was seeing this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.110
 here he does not record if I have 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.790
 recording a video and came to this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.520
 start recording will stop 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.200
 It is worth remembering that only the balanced game 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 That's why I really need it. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.860

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
