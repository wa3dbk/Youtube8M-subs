00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
we also have come full circle the entire

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.080 
we also have come full circle the entire
point<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> turn<00:01:56.549> off<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> laser

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

at<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> beginning<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> level<00:01:58.110> which

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
at the beginning of the level which

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.550 
at the beginning of the level which
allows<00:01:58.680> us<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> drop<00:01:59.719> down<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> guess<00:02:01.170> into<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
allows us to drop down I guess into the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.480 
allows us to drop down I guess into the
very<00:02:01.860> heart<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.560> silverback<00:02:04.560> stronghold

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.900

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910 
actually quite a few of quite a few
enemies<00:02:12.060> down<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.660> general<00:02:13.050> area<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.620> would

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
enemies down this general area I would

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.240 
enemies down this general area I would
say<00:02:15.140> sometimes<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> auto<00:02:16.470> aiming<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> bit

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
say sometimes the auto aiming is a bit

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.320 
say sometimes the auto aiming is a bit
of<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.520> bit<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> pain<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:19.050> alright<00:02:20.330> because

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
of a bit of pain that's alright because

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
of a bit of pain that's alright because
we<00:02:21.570> do<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.840> plenty<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.350> ammunition<00:02:22.620> for

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
we do have plenty of ammunition for

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.280 
we do have plenty of ammunition for
plenty<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.640> our<00:02:23.790> good<00:02:24.180> weapons<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
plenty of our good weapons and the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.880 
plenty of our good weapons and the
enemies<00:02:28.650> are<00:02:28.830> nice<00:02:29.100> enough<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:30.230> joyously<00:02:31.230> hop

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
enemies are nice enough to joyously hop

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.600 
enemies are nice enough to joyously hop
over<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.490> us<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.850> get<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.150> within<00:02:33.330> fire<00:02:33.660> damage

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.850 

but<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.390> area<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> our

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
but up in this area is going to be our

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.100 
but up in this area is going to be our
last<00:02:41.190> secret<00:02:41.760> which<00:02:42.030> i<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.720> another

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
last secret which i think is another

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
last secret which i think is another
mini<00:02:43.980> chain<00:02:44.610> gun<00:02:45.000> chink<00:02:45.900> mini<00:02:46.260> laser<00:02:47.190> Gatling

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
mini chain gun chink mini laser Gatling

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.520 
mini chain gun chink mini laser Gatling
because<00:02:48.300> everything<00:02:48.690> has<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.080> lasers

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
because everything has to be lasers

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.170 
because everything has to be lasers
bullets<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.310> completely<00:02:50.940> ineffective

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
bullets are completely ineffective

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.900 
bullets are completely ineffective
against<00:02:52.880> mutated<00:02:53.880> monkeys<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.930> some<00:02:55.080> reason

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.810 

now<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:01.380> area<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:02.010> over<00:03:02.190> into

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
now this little area I'm going over into

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.060 
now this little area I'm going over into
isn't<00:03:03.030> actually<00:03:03.600> necessary<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.739> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
isn't actually necessary for the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.000 
isn't actually necessary for the
continuation<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.120> level<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:07.860> out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
continuation of the level it's just out

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680 
continuation of the level it's just out
of<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.340> spike<00:03:08.640> because<00:03:09.030> these<00:03:09.180> guys<00:03:09.420> are

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
of here spike because these guys are

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.620 
of here spike because these guys are
doing<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:11.310> honestly<00:03:11.760> both<00:03:11.970> these<00:03:12.209> enemies

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
doing like honestly both these enemies

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.360 
doing like honestly both these enemies
are<00:03:12.780> annoying<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.800> back<00:03:14.100> in

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
are annoying because they do not back in

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.820 
are annoying because they do not back in
because<00:03:14.840> they<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.170> don't<00:03:16.380> do<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.709> much

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
because they really don't do that much

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.090 
because they really don't do that much
damage<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:21.680> but<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.830> think

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
damage they just kind of go but I think

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.350 
damage they just kind of go but I think
there's<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.549> be<00:03:23.610> one<00:03:23.970> more

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
there's just going to be one more

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.199 
there's just going to be one more

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
was a great pun and even more awkward

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.800 
was a great pun and even more awkward
viewing<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.970> carbonite<00:03:54.780> breasts<00:03:56.810> but

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
viewing of the carbonite breasts but

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.810

around<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.580> fill<00:04:05.940> ourselves

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
around here that we can fill ourselves

up on Oh actually I think we already got
it<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.110> all<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.440> need<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.830> now<00:04:11.070> is

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
it and so all we need to do now is
