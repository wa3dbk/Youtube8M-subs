I really am loving this windscreen it's
a<00:00:11.889> stock<00:00:12.309> one<00:00:12.340> but<00:00:13.269> one<00:00:13.900> problem<00:00:14.410> I've<00:00:14.619> noticed

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
a stock one but one problem I've noticed

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.200 
a stock one but one problem I've noticed
actually<00:00:15.129> is<00:00:17.009> it<00:00:18.009> makes<00:00:18.279> like<00:00:18.400> a<00:00:18.490> bit<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.029> a

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
actually is it makes like a bit of a

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.820 
actually is it makes like a bit of a
rattling<00:00:19.869> noise

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
rattling noise

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.060 
rattling noise
for<00:00:22.430> some<00:00:22.640> reason

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
for some reason

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.250 
for some reason
I<00:00:25.130> think<00:00:25.850> right<00:00:26.000> over<00:00:26.240> here<00:00:26.539> it's<00:00:26.690> not<00:00:26.869> tight

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
I think right over here it's not tight

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.490 
I think right over here it's not tight
enough<00:00:27.289> or<00:00:27.890> something<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.260> it's<00:00:30.260> kind<00:00:30.470> of

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
enough or something so it's kind of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.830 
enough or something so it's kind of
making<00:00:30.619> as<00:00:30.920> we<00:00:31.130> r<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.369> know<00:00:31.490> plastic<00:00:31.939> against

I don't know if you can hear in the
video<00:00:37.710> knob<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> bothering<00:00:38.850> me

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
video knob but it's kind of bothering me

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.139 
video knob but it's kind of bothering me
actually<00:00:40.219> it<00:00:41.219> shouldn't<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.760> anything<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
down maybe put a piece of tape in there

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.009 
down maybe put a piece of tape in there
or<00:00:48.510> something<00:00:48.769> just<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.920> stop<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> rattling

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
or something just to stop the rattling
