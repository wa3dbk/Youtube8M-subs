00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
 and well you have been commenting distract 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.120
 the gameplay of black comptos and how 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.730
 you are seeing around here I was using 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.709
 the fal but good more than gameplay 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 should qualify a part of a gameplay 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.360
 to get rescue from the cinema mode 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.310
 cinema mode that great mode that came out in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.660
 color beauty in the black ops and that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
 it worked also and it worked 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 even well which fher 3 wanted 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.270
 I download to hallucinate and that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.270
 just in this game he played 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.620
 I perfect it is worth the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.600
 truth is cinema mode I thought they had 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.789
 arranged even though the best was going or 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.870
 worse but that was going at least it has 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.760
 liked the games but half of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.649
 the times he says australes he gets me a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.659
 good game I'm always recording 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.519
 but the rest that he says he's getting out of me 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.899
 a pretty funny game can I 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.510
 shares things the cinema mode and now that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 more or not is the part and leaves or is missing 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.980
 half then make a game of gold 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.710
 by teams that has lasted eight minutes 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 salts and is three minutes in the cinema 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.280
 and witness what happens with the rest that happens 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.269
 or not and nothing is left without it but good 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.489
 as I tell you state so that using 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.500
 the lack of euro that I already have for 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.180
 quite and for me with the sector of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 automatic fire is the best rifle 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 assault there 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.049
 I also liked a lot aesthetically 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.280
 like the average secret how to put 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.350
 no accessory I always carry 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 hilt and so on and as I say kills you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 in an exaggerated way against 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 simple the cinema mode so good this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.850
 part of the game records from mode 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 movies because always records for extra the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 first game that I played I had 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 open the capturing program is 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 say capturing that I have that is the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 of the cat whenever I start recording or 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 well I do not even have to record whenever 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.840
 in console games you have the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.820
 captured captive they imagine 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 that you are playing a game and have 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.549
 lasted 20 minutes then country on the line 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.080
 of the time in which you can go to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.520
 back and forward say of this house 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.549
 virtual capture program and I started 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.689
 to play you have as your program let's say 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.890
 a timeline which then is for 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.689
 transparent then say I want to record from 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.830
 here here then for that reason always 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.590
 I have a program and I always get 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.599
 record the games were not much more 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 easily and just in this case I did not have 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.750
 that's why I had to go to the cinema mode and the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 half of the game because it is not there but 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 good that I mess with cinema mode 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.560
 I discovered that there was or is a guy who is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.090
 exaggerated now what are you going to see a little 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 later 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.290
 the train passes between that train in which 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 I plan to do something but that 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.580
 I still have not had the luck that I 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 come out my idea to study a c4 what happens 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.250
 the train in domain game mode and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.569
 just that c4 that sticks to the train 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.819
 detonate it but when it's over 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.379
 forward is to say that it is going 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.150
 point of the map and get kill 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.049
 someone with a c4 but well that 's another 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.580
 thing there is another story 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.010
 all the nonsense of those mines that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.049
 I really have what I wanted to do in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.580
 this in this game that you see here 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.040
 comes the train and righteous who come 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.780
 careful not that it can be dangerous kim to 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.190
 all star to get as you are 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.810
 seeing my knees that everything is 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.130
 heavy was already counting my nonsense 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.440
 meanwhile in the print 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.360
 stabilizing kill and here you see how there 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.190
 one low and another low and oyster and this 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 Well it's worth the one that you jump on the road 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.079
 of the train or you realize but this 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.319
 Attentive man or this is a suicide 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.530
 is going to fix is â€‹â€‹seriously said that 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.600
 I thought this man, what do you think? 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.350
 who said come three jump and tucked 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.030
 or that said oysters I've seen there's a 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.480
 hole that is open that I do not 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.280
 I was really hallucinating and that is what 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.400
 I say I do not know what they wanted 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.170
 be that which said to have come I will 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.090
 jump from three to the best if you open a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.820
 interdimensional parallel portal that I 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.780
 leads to narnia or fact that you hear 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.460
 present the harry potter train and 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.170
 I appear at hogwarts or sincerely 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.040
 not because it's worth catching you at the beginning 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.510
 it's worth catching you at the end 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640
 he just jumped thinking that he already 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.710
 had passed the good train can strain 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.230
 it's not a little absurd but hey you can 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.200
 spend or 500 jumping over from a 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.510
 wagon to another operative you try and not 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.360
 I do not understand what you try and you so 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.390
 quiet up to the train and from 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.710
 suddenly jump please please leave 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.030
 in the comments that is what you think 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.740
 that it was possible to pass to the man 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.260
 head so that after the novice level 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.910
 19 for the sake of yourself 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.710
 let's say that much more objective what 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.810
 You can think of the Saturday 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.070
 when jumping on the train but good not to be a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.900
 attempted suicide with an attempt to 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.330
 complete suicide and here you see how it 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.890
 the game is over but the game ends 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.390
 which is worth noting and I turn it around 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.670
 say what is your opinion has 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.470
 liked the video voted side and nothing a 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.880
 just everyone and see you in the next we 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.880
 audits the train tracks bye bye
