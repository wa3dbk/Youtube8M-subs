00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
is that the top convection oven actually

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
what I love about this kitchen is that

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.260 
what I love about this kitchen is that
there<00:05:45.760> isn't<00:05:45.910> just<00:05:46.090> one<00:05:46.330> word<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:47.050> describe<00:05:47.080> it

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
there isn't just one word to describe it

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.940 
there isn't just one word to describe it
there's<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.480> little<00:05:49.900> bit<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.380> few<00:05:50.620> different

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
there's a little bit of a few different

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.920 
there's a little bit of a few different
looks<00:05:51.160> going<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.700> but<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.420> way<00:05:52.540> that<00:05:52.690> we<00:05:52.780> made

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
looks going on but the way that we made

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.960 
looks going on but the way that we made
it<00:05:53.020> work<00:05:53.230> is<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.590> we<00:05:53.710> kept<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.190> balance<00:05:54.460> even

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
it work is that we kept the balance even

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.240 
it work is that we kept the balance even
from<00:05:55.540> one<00:05:55.720> aspect<00:05:56.230> to<00:05:56.410> another<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:57.100> that's

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
from one aspect to another and that's

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.040 
from one aspect to another and that's
what<00:05:57.430> makes<00:05:57.640> it<00:05:57.760> a<00:05:57.850> harmonious<00:05:58.420> mix<00:05:58.720> that<00:05:59.020> I

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
what makes it a harmonious mix that I

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.990 
what makes it a harmonious mix that I
think<00:05:59.320> really<00:05:59.680> suits<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.100> home<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:00.670> the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
think really suits the home and the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.679 
think really suits the home and the
homeowners
