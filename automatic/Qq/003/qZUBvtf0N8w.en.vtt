just<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.440> lot<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.620> trick<00:02:06.860> parts<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.280> heavier

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
just a lot of trick parts on it heavier

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.760 
just a lot of trick parts on it heavier
shops<00:02:07.880> crazy<00:02:08.270> it's<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.840> fully<00:02:09.229> adjustable

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
shops crazy it's like fully adjustable

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.910 
shops crazy it's like fully adjustable
everything's<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.550> tweakable<00:02:11.470> all<00:02:12.470> together

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
everything's like tweakable all together

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.060 
everything's like tweakable all together
it<00:02:13.160> was<00:02:13.340> harder<00:02:13.820> than<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.510> expected<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.830> not

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
it was harder than I expected but not

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.630 
it was harder than I expected but not
the<00:02:16.760> bill<00:02:16.940> itself<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:19.100> inside<00:02:19.610> that

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
the bill itself just to be inside that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.960 
the bill itself just to be inside that
time<00:02:20.210> frame<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.110> bill<00:02:21.620> went<00:02:21.830> well<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.280> think<00:02:22.760> we

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
time frame if bill went well I think we

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.820 
time frame if bill went well I think we
accomplished<00:02:23.450> exactly<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.530> set<00:02:24.710> out<00:02:24.740> to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
accomplished exactly what we set out to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.680 
accomplished exactly what we set out to

job<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.970> paint<00:02:29.150> from<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> beginning<00:02:30.320> I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
job on the paint from the beginning I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530 
job on the paint from the beginning I
thought<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:31.580> would<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.850> good<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.240> would<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
thought it would a good it would be a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.480 
thought it would a good it would be a
good<00:02:32.750> idea<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.680> bike<00:02:33.890> painted<00:02:34.370> in

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
good idea to have the bike painted in

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.490 
good idea to have the bike painted in
gold<00:02:34.700> because<00:02:35.150> i<00:02:35.180> never<00:02:35.360> saw<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> gold<00:02:36.050> be<00:02:36.260> max

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
gold because i never saw a gold be max

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500 
gold because i never saw a gold be max
you<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:36.830> when<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.340> received<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> parts<00:02:38.300> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
you know when I received the parts that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.020 
you know when I received the parts that
was<00:02:39.080> really<00:02:39.530> hard<00:02:39.770> for<00:02:39.920> me<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.370> imagine<00:02:40.459> if

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
was really hard for me to imagine if

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.910 
was really hard for me to imagine if
that<00:02:41.209> will<00:02:41.450> really<00:02:41.990> match<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.320> bike<00:02:42.709> because

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
that will really match the bike because

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.949 
that will really match the bike because
the<00:02:43.430> rest<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.880> bike<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.209> silver<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.630> black

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
the rest of the bike is silver and black

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.949 
the rest of the bike is silver and black
you<00:02:45.380> know<00:02:45.530> i<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:46.220> you're<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.700> bid<00:02:47.360> was<00:02:47.570> very

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
you know i think you're the bid was very

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.170 
you know i think you're the bid was very
difficult<00:02:48.200> because<00:02:48.550> we<00:02:49.550> don't<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.150> much

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
difficult because we don't have so much

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.070 
difficult because we don't have so much
time<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.650> build<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.800> bike<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.220> he's<00:02:52.490> was<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
time to build the bike so he's was a

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.750 
time to build the bike so he's was a
drugging<00:02:54.080> ruin<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> bike<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.830> finish<00:02:55.280> by<00:02:55.490> time

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
drugging ruin to bike to finish by time

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.790 
drugging ruin to bike to finish by time
we<00:02:56.750> got<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.959> thing<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.440> pretty<00:02:57.650> good

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
we got the thing is pretty good

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800 
we got the thing is pretty good
it's<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.190> high<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.120> writer<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.660> we

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's it's high but it's a writer like we

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.600 
it's it's high but it's a writer like we
built<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.110> motorcycle<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.100> ride<00:03:01.130> not<00:03:01.580> a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
built a motorcycle to ride not a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.630 
built a motorcycle to ride not a
motorcycle<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.330> sit<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.900> look<00:03:02.989> pretty<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.640> you

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
motorcycle to sit and look pretty so you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.070 
motorcycle to sit and look pretty so you
know<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.150> accomplished<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.600> goal<00:03:05.750> I

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
know I think we accomplished that goal I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.860 
know I think we accomplished that goal I
think<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.340> would<00:03:07.550> like<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.510> budget

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
think I would like I like the budget

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.070 
think I would like I like the budget
because<00:03:09.519> its<00:03:10.519> aggressive<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.390> would<00:03:11.930> like

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
because its aggressive that I would like

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.770 
because its aggressive that I would like
at<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.380> beginning<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.920> bike<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.780> was

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
at the beginning of the bike and was

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.080 
at the beginning of the bike and was
futuristic<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.800> aggressive<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.940> who<00:03:17.030> I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
futuristic and the aggressive it who I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.199 
futuristic and the aggressive it who I
wanted<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> too<00:03:17.900> i<00:03:17.930> like<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.650> whitest<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
wanted that too i like the whitest it

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.300 
wanted that too i like the whitest it
turned<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.600> actually<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.230> way<00:03:21.350> i<00:03:21.380> plan<00:03:21.980> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
turned out actually the way i plan to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.400 
turned out actually the way i plan to
you<00:03:22.580> know<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.030> I'm<00:03:23.360> really<00:03:23.570> satisfied<00:03:23.870> with

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you know so I'm really satisfied with

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.850 
you know so I'm really satisfied with
the<00:03:24.500> bike<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.010> his<00:03:25.550> look<00:03:26.260> maybe<00:03:27.260> if<00:03:27.500> we<00:03:27.530> had

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
the bike and his look maybe if we had

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.280 
the bike and his look maybe if we had
more<00:03:28.489> time<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:29.239> would<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> little

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
more time it would be a little

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
more time it would be a little
radical<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.530> know<00:03:32.740> but<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.819> most<00:03:33.970> important

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
radical you know but the most important

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.530 
radical you know but the most important
thing<00:03:34.569> as<00:03:34.840> i<00:03:34.959> already<00:03:35.110> said<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:36.370> keep<00:03:37.330> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
thing as i already said is to keep the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.900 
thing as i already said is to keep the
bike<00:03:38.280> squeezing<00:03:39.280> your<00:03:39.580> gym

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.670 

we<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:47.240> really<00:03:47.540> paid<00:03:48.110> attention<00:03:48.140> to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
we just really paid attention to

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.870 
we just really paid attention to
aesthetically<00:03:49.280> trying<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.700> make<00:03:49.850> things

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
aesthetically trying to make things

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.900 
aesthetically trying to make things
right<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:51.380> bit<00:03:51.560> cleaner<00:03:52.280> kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.820> a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
right and a little bit cleaner kind of a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.520 
right and a little bit cleaner kind of a
more<00:03:53.180> aggressive<00:03:53.480> approach<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.260> what<00:03:54.380> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
more aggressive approach to what the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.890 
more aggressive approach to what the
bike<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:56.060> what<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.210> think<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.570> heart<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
bike to what I think the heart of the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.180 
bike to what I think the heart of the
bike<00:03:57.110> really<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.860> just<00:03:57.890> this

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
bike really is is just this

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.520 
bike really is is just this
ultra-aggressive<00:03:58.700> more<00:03:59.540> race<00:03:59.750> style<00:04:00.110> machine

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530

so<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.130> went<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.640> little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.150> direction<00:04:02.480> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
so we went a little bit that direction I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:16.030 
so we went a little bit that direction I
think<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:03.470> we<00:04:03.560> hit<00:04:03.680> it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.940 

the<00:04:17.040> big<00:04:17.250> challenge<00:04:17.280> for<00:04:17.730> me<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.209> was<00:04:18.390> to

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
the big challenge for me it was to

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.490 
the big challenge for me it was to
conserve<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.209> feeling<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.480> v-max<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.049> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
conserve the feeling of the v-max so the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.670 
conserve the feeling of the v-max so the
intake<00:04:22.920> air<00:04:23.280> outside<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.240> exhaust<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:25.500> me

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
intake air outside and exhaust for me

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.460 
intake air outside and exhaust for me
most<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.670> be<00:04:26.970> charged<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.200> place

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
most have not be charged of the place

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.640 
most have not be charged of the place
and<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.610> was<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> challenge<00:04:30.120> for<00:04:30.450> me<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.650> keep

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and it was the challenge for me to keep

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.460 
and it was the challenge for me to keep
the<00:04:31.830> spirit<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.430> v-max<00:04:33.090> still<00:04:33.840> also

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the spirit of the v-max still also

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.490 
the spirit of the v-max still also
during<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.010> building<00:04:35.430> process<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:36.150> was

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
during the building process I was

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.020
