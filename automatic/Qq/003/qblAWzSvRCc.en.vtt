00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
I'm Donna Marie from Glover nursery and

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'm Donna Marie from Glover nursery and
we<00:00:07.920> are<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.370> prune<00:00:08.820> an<00:00:09.030> upright<00:00:09.420> juniper

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
we are going to prune an upright juniper

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.890 
we are going to prune an upright juniper
this<00:00:10.680> is<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.890> Blue<00:00:11.220> Point<00:00:11.490> juniper<00:00:12.180> it's<00:00:12.780> in

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
this is a Blue Point juniper it's in

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
this is a Blue Point juniper it's in
pretty<00:00:13.170> good<00:00:13.260> shape<00:00:13.850> except<00:00:14.850> you<00:00:15.000> can

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
pretty good shape except you can

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910 
pretty good shape except you can
probably<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:16.800> bit

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
probably see that it's a little bit

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.990 
probably see that it's a little bit
lopsided<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.930> even<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
lopsided so I want to even it out and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.029 
lopsided so I want to even it out and
because<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.270> prickly<00:00:21.720> I'm<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.860> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
because these are prickly I'm going to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.940 
because these are prickly I'm going to
wear<00:00:23.190> gloves<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.020> I<00:00:25.020> always<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> wear

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
wear gloves and I always like to wear

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.340 
wear gloves and I always like to wear
eye<00:00:26.010> protection<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.390> pruning<00:00:27.720> even

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
eye protection when I'm pruning even

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.330 
eye protection when I'm pruning even
with<00:00:28.500> hand<00:00:28.740> tools

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
with hand tools

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.810 
with hand tools
so<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.680> method<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.219> take<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> good

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so my first method is just take a good

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.430 
so my first method is just take a good
quality<00:00:33.329> pair<00:00:33.629> of<00:00:34.309> pruning<00:00:35.309> shears<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
quality pair of pruning shears and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.520 
quality pair of pruning shears and
follow<00:00:37.440> each<00:00:37.860> branch<00:00:38.610> down<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:40.079> where<00:00:40.290> you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
follow each branch down to where you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.250 
follow each branch down to where you
want<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.310> meet<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.360> rest<00:00:42.630> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> plant

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
want it to meet the rest of the plant

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
want it to meet the rest of the plant
and<00:00:44.420> clip<00:00:45.420> off<00:00:46.190> individual<00:00:47.190> branches<00:00:47.840> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and clip off individual branches that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
and clip off individual branches that
way<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.440> doesn't<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.730> pruned

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
way it doesn't look like you just pruned

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.290 
way it doesn't look like you just pruned
it<00:00:51.540> you're<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> make<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.130> look<00:00:53.309> very

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it you're going to make it look very

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.139 
it you're going to make it look very
natural<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.800> yet<00:00:56.040> symmetrical<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:58.940> would<00:00:59.940> keep

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
natural but yet symmetrical I would keep

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.869 
natural but yet symmetrical I would keep
going<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.930> until<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.879> everything

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
going on this until I get everything

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.859 
going on this until I get everything
nice<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.469> even<00:01:04.469> and<00:01:04.680> tidy<00:01:05.360> however<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.719> have

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
nice and even and tidy however if I have

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
nice and even and tidy however if I have
a<00:01:06.899> hedge<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.439> 15<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.040> 20<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
a hedge of 15 or 20 of these and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
a hedge of 15 or 20 of these and
probably<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> way<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
probably not going to do it this way I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.410 
probably not going to do it this way I
may<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> resort<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.990> power<00:01:13.920> tools<00:01:14.420> this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
may have to resort to power tools this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.500 
may have to resort to power tools this

I<00:01:18.659> rarely<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.280> piece<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.760> equipment<00:01:21.270> but

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
I rarely use this piece of equipment but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
I rarely use this piece of equipment but
sometimes<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> am<00:01:23.010> doing<00:01:23.340> plants<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
sometimes when I am doing plants that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
sometimes when I am doing plants that
recover<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.840> shearing<00:01:25.409> easily<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.430> I've

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
recover from shearing easily and I've

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
recover from shearing easily and I've
got<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.360> them<00:01:27.540> I'll<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> electric

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
got a lot of them I'll use the electric

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.160 

I'm<00:01:54.310> careful<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.520> go<00:01:55.790> slowly<00:01:56.210> don't<00:01:56.660> take<00:01:56.930> too

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
I'm careful to go slowly don't take too

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.860 
I'm careful to go slowly don't take too
much<00:01:57.320> off<00:01:57.620> at<00:01:57.860> once<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.820> can<00:01:59.000> always<00:01:59.210> cut<00:01:59.600> more

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
much off at once you can always cut more

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.410 
much off at once you can always cut more
but<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:00.290> hard<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.650> glue<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.950> back<00:02:00.980> on<00:02:01.370> so<00:02:02.180> take

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
but it's hard to glue it back on so take

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.480 
but it's hard to glue it back on so take
it<00:02:02.600> slow<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.140> easy<00:02:03.290> make<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.280> nice<00:02:04.460> and
