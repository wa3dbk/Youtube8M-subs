all the build-up of stuff in there you
know<00:00:53.850> around<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> inside<00:00:54.989> edge<00:00:55.160> that's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
know around the inside edge that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.510 
know around the inside edge that's
actually<00:00:56.730> metal<00:00:57.500> we<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.530> present<00:00:59.129> evening

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
actually metal we can present evening

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually metal we can present evening
itself<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> point<00:01:00.510> where<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.870> locked<00:01:01.109> up

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
itself to the point where it's locked up

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.250 
itself to the point where it's locked up
like<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.530 

that's<00:01:07.260> awful<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.400> entire<00:01:08.729> system<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that's awful the entire system is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.469 
that's awful the entire system is
destroyed<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:12.330> all

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
destroyed because of it you know all

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.800 
destroyed because of it you know all
that<00:01:12.750> through<00:01:13.350> everything<00:01:14.540> in<00:01:15.540> fact

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that through everything in fact

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.190 
that through everything in fact
you'd<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> replace<00:01:17.070> everything<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> I'm

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you'd have to replace everything so I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
you'd have to replace everything so I'm
going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.310> receive

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
going to take this off and then receive

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
going to take this off and then receive
a<00:01:20.700> dryer<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.060> give<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> Ed<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.110> autopsy

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a dryer and give it to Ed for autopsy

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.800 
a dryer and give it to Ed for autopsy
this<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.520> quite<00:01:23.759> interesting<00:01:26.780> well<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this will be quite interesting well I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
this will be quite interesting well I
found<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> engine<00:01:28.829> number<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.610> did

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
found the engine number on this and did

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.960 
found the engine number on this and did
a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.909> research<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.840> found<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.799> is

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
a little research and found that it is

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
a little research and found that it is
definitely<00:01:32.970> oh<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.490> 304<00:01:36.770> who<00:01:37.770> knows

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
definitely oh it was a 304 who knows

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
definitely oh it was a 304 who knows
what<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.369> been<00:01:38.549> done<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.450> been<00:01:39.630> fully

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
what has been done so it has been fully

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.649 
what has been done so it has been fully
rebuilt<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:41.009> gas<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> don't<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.540> what

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
rebuilt for gas so I don't know what

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.350 
rebuilt for gas so I don't know what
cranks<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.549> don't<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> anything<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
cranks in it don't know anything so it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.859 
cranks in it don't know anything so it
could<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.570> 308<00:01:46.140> again<00:01:46.470> dunno<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> know

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
could be 308 again dunno but all I know

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
could be 308 again dunno but all I know
is<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.560> gas<00:01:49.740> engine

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is it's a gas engine

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.560 
is it's a gas engine
desk<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.180> gatherings<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:52.079> heads<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.570> other

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
desk and gatherings get heads and other

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.510 
desk and gatherings get heads and other
stuff<00:01:56.270> they<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.659> from<00:01:57.780> there

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.870 

hmm<00:02:01.580> gearbox<00:02:02.360> on<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.780> trolley<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:06.580> here<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.670> go

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
hmm gearbox on a trolley now here we go

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.990 
hmm gearbox on a trolley now here we go
I'll<00:02:08.360> strip<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.670> enough<00:02:10.670> at<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
I'll strip that then enough at the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.940 
I'll strip that then enough at the
moment<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.380> save<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.830> some<00:02:12.860> more<00:02:13.160> money<00:02:13.400> and

tomorrow<00:02:19.310> might<00:02:19.580> take<00:02:19.850> off<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.180> inlet

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
tomorrow might take off the inlet

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.620 
tomorrow might take off the inlet
manifold<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> look<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:22.510> need<00:02:23.510> to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
manifold and just have a look I need to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.120 
manifold and just have a look I need to
change<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.050> sample<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.680> other<00:02:24.920> one

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130

I'll<00:02:25.490> change<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.910> rocket<00:02:26.209> covers<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
I'll change the rocket covers with the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.050 
I'll change the rocket covers with the
other<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.310> manifold<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
other one you like manifold with the
