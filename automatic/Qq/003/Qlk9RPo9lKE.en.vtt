was of a really gorgeous figured

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
was of a really gorgeous figured
mahogany<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.159> almost<00:01:47.340> looked<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.759> maple<00:01:48.300> had

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mahogany it almost looked like maple had

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.219 
mahogany it almost looked like maple had
so<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:48.960> flame<00:01:49.460> well<00:01:50.570> those<00:01:51.570> guitars<00:01:52.020> were

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so much flame well those guitars were

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
so much flame well those guitars were
built<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> very<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.220> limited<00:01:53.520> quantity

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
built in a very very limited quantity

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.899 
built in a very very limited quantity
and<00:01:54.530> oddly<00:01:55.530> enough<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.310> were<00:01:56.399> actually<00:01:56.580> able

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and oddly enough we were actually able

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.770 
and oddly enough we were actually able
to<00:01:57.330> score<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> bodies<00:01:59.210> that<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.509> had

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to score one of the bodies that they had

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
to score one of the bodies that they had
I<00:02:01.200> guess<00:02:01.440> had<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.100> extra<00:02:02.460> woods<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.940> they

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I guess had little extra woods so they

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
I guess had little extra woods so they
built<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.140> does<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.830> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
built this up so this does not have the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.999 
built this up so this does not have the
the<00:02:06.060> fancy<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.720> light<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.289> had<00:02:07.470> put<00:02:07.679> on<00:02:07.830> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the fancy in light they had put on that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249

in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> matching<00:02:08.729> HAMP<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> does

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
in the matching HAMP but what it does

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.280
