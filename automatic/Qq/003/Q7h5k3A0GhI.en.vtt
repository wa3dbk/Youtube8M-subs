stabilized<00:02:53.230> cup<00:02:53.530> core<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:54.370> minimize<00:02:54.820> that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
stabilized cup core to minimize that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.000 
stabilized cup core to minimize that
microphonic<00:02:55.540> noise<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.620> get<00:02:56.890> that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
microphonic noise so you get that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.280 
microphonic noise so you get that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:50.159 

I<00:03:43.720> won<00:03:44.720> one<00:03:47.709> now<00:03:48.709> let's<00:03:48.980> look<00:03:49.220> at<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.909> crybaby

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
I won one now let's look at the crybaby

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.789 
I won one now let's look at the crybaby
mini<00:03:51.169> wah

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
mini wah

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.550 
mini wah
this<00:03:52.519> was<00:03:52.760> half<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.359> size<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.930> crybaby<00:03:54.169> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
this was half the size of a crybaby and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.039 
this was half the size of a crybaby and
is<00:03:54.859> still<00:03:55.159> built<00:03:55.489> like<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.700> tank<00:03:55.969> it's<00:03:56.569> perfect

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
is still built like a tank it's perfect

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.539 
is still built like a tank it's perfect
for<00:03:57.079> your<00:03:57.290> mini<00:03:57.469> pedal<00:03:57.829> board<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.189> on<00:03:58.280> top<00:03:58.519> of

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
for your mini pedal board and on top of

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.789 
for your mini pedal board and on top of
that<00:03:58.700> it's<00:03:59.239> got<00:03:59.419> a<00:03:59.480> Facel<00:03:59.900> inductor<00:04:00.620> with

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
that it's got a Facel inductor with

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.750 
that it's got a Facel inductor with
three<00:04:01.099> different<00:04:01.280> voices<00:04:01.909> GCB<00:04:02.780> 95<00:04:03.730> vintage

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
three different voices GCB 95 vintage

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.240 
three different voices GCB 95 vintage
and<00:04:04.969> low<00:04:05.620> essentially<00:04:06.620> those<00:04:06.859> are<00:04:07.069> high

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and low essentially those are high

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.640 
and low essentially those are high
middle<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.760> low<00:04:07.849> frequency<00:04:08.599> centers<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.560> in

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
middle and low frequency centers so in

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.500 
middle and low frequency centers so in
one<00:04:09.829> pedal<00:04:10.159> you<00:04:10.519> basically<00:04:10.940> get<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.329> full

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
one pedal you basically get the full

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.960 
one pedal you basically get the full
range<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.989> vintage<00:04:12.319> watt<00:04:12.560> own<00:04:12.859> to<00:04:13.489> change<00:04:13.760> the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
range of vintage watt own to change the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:05:26.249 
range of vintage watt own to change the
voicing<00:04:14.419> just<00:04:15.169> remove<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.709> bottom<00:04:16.010> plate

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.839 

not<00:05:27.259> all<00:05:27.409> crybabies<00:05:27.919> sound<00:05:28.129> the<00:05:28.250> same<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:28.699> it's

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
not all crybabies sound the same so it's

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.640 
not all crybabies sound the same so it's
important<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.389> find<00:05:29.509> a<00:05:29.689> vintage<00:05:30.020> voice<00:05:30.229> model

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
important to find a vintage voice model

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.770 
important to find a vintage voice model
that<00:05:30.770> fits<00:05:31.039> your<00:05:31.189> style<00:05:31.310> be<00:05:32.150> sure<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.509> look<00:05:32.629> at
