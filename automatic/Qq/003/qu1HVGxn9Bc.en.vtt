hey guys welcome back in this video I'm
gonna<00:00:03.270> be<00:00:03.419> making<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.929> clock<00:00:04.230> with<00:00:04.740> beer<00:00:05.190> bottle

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
gonna be making a clock with beer bottle

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.909 
gonna be making a clock with beer bottle
caps<00:00:05.819> as<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.270> numbers<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.560> don't<00:00:07.770> know

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
caps as the numbers and I don't know

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.879 
caps as the numbers and I don't know
where<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.300> first<00:00:09.300> saw<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.719> idea<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:10.469> I'm

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
where I first saw this idea but I'm

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.530 
where I first saw this idea but I'm
gonna<00:00:10.980> see<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.519> could<00:00:11.670> try<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> make<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:14.540> so

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
gonna see if I could try to make it so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.300 
gonna see if I could try to make it so
first<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> ripped<00:00:16.139> up<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:17.039> two<00:00:17.279> inches

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
first I ripped up on to about two inches

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
first I ripped up on to about two inches
wide<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.300> half<00:00:18.480> an<00:00:18.630> inch<00:00:18.690> thick<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.320> then<00:00:19.859> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
wide and a half an inch thick and then I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700 
wide and a half an inch thick and then I
use<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.369> miter<00:00:20.580> sled<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.359> make<00:00:22.170> more<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:22.529> less<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
use my miter sled to make more or less a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150 
use my miter sled to make more or less a
picture<00:00:23.160> frame<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:24.570> marking<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.859> face

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
picture frame and I'm marking which face

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.480 
picture frame and I'm marking which face
I<00:00:26.460> cut<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.939> each<00:00:27.119> side<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.140> blade<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:29.220> make

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
I cut on each side of the blade to make

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:41.470 
I cut on each side of the blade to make
sure<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> 90<00:00:30.359> degree<00:00:30.689> angle<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.529> then

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.270 

I'm<00:00:42.480> using<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.930> half<00:00:43.140> inch<00:00:43.350> straight<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I'm using a half inch straight bit to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
I'm using a half inch straight bit to
read<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> groove<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> clock<00:00:45.989> face

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
read out a groove so that the clock face

00:00:46.289 --> 00:01:01.880 
read out a groove so that the clock face
could<00:00:46.559> sit<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.800> two

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.479 

and<00:01:03.199> recycling<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.410> scraps<00:01:04.770> I<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.370> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and recycling some scraps I can make the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:23.550 
and recycling some scraps I can make the
clockface

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.650 

the<00:01:24.560> next<00:01:24.860> day<00:01:24.980> after<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.430> glue<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.820> dry<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.090> cut

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
the next day after the glue is dry I cut

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.400 
the next day after the glue is dry I cut
it<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.960> ten<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.010> half<00:01:28.190> inches<00:01:28.430> square<00:01:29.410> this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
it to ten and a half inches square this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.990 
it to ten and a half inches square this
doesn't<00:01:30.740> really<00:01:30.860> matter<00:01:31.190> what<00:01:31.430> size<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.910> is

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
doesn't really matter what size it is

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.150 
doesn't really matter what size it is
all<00:01:32.480> depends<00:01:33.080> on<00:01:33.230> how<00:01:33.440> big<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.860> make<00:01:34.010> the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
all depends on how big you make the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:44.990 
all depends on how big you make the
frame

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.700 

and<00:01:46.000> after<00:01:46.870> doing<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.200> dry<00:01:47.410> assembly

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and after doing a dry assembly

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.920 
and after doing a dry assembly
everything<00:01:48.340> looks<00:01:48.730> pretty<00:01:48.970> good<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.540> fits

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
everything looks pretty good and fits

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.050 
everything looks pretty good and fits
pretty<00:01:50.110> good<00:01:50.230> so<00:01:50.590> I'm<00:01:51.130> gonna<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.790> ahead<00:01:51.910> and

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:05.290 
pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and
glue<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.450> all<00:01:52.540> up

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.910 

the<00:02:06.300> next<00:02:06.660> step<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.140> countersink<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the next step was to countersink the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.310 
the next step was to countersink the
clock<00:02:08.250> mechanism<00:02:08.490> into<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.570> back<00:02:09.810> using<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
clock mechanism into the back using a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.590 
clock mechanism into the back using a
Forstner<00:02:10.680> bit<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:12.000> course<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.420> wasn't

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Forstner bit and of course I wasn't

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.570 
Forstner bit and of course I wasn't
paying<00:02:12.870> attention<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> depth<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
paying attention to the depth and the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.640 
paying attention to the depth and the
center<00:02:14.880> spur<00:02:15.210> broke<00:02:15.720> through<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.410> front

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
center spur broke through to the front

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.070 
center spur broke through to the front
of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> clock<00:02:17.070> face<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.120> after<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:18.960> of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
of the clock face so after a lot of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.670 
of the clock face so after a lot of
cursing<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.920> screaming<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.450> threw<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.320> piece

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
cursing and screaming I threw that piece

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.190 
cursing and screaming I threw that piece
out<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.730> made<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> completely<00:02:24.690> new<00:02:24.840> frame

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
out and I made a completely new frame

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.100 
out and I made a completely new frame
and<00:02:25.590> clock<00:02:26.010> face<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.600> second<00:02:27.960> time

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and clock face and the second time

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
and clock face and the second time
around<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.680> used<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.160> plunge<00:02:29.430> router<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
around I used a plunge router and a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
around I used a plunge router and a
straight<00:02:30.270> instead<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> Forstner<00:02:31.830> bit<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
straight instead of the Forstner bit and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
straight instead of the Forstner bit and
that<00:02:33.030> worked<00:02:33.210> pretty<00:02:33.360> well

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.290 

I'm<00:02:43.900> using<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.530> stain<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.160> polyurethane<00:02:45.370> Nicks

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
I'm using a stain and polyurethane Nicks

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.210 
I'm using a stain and polyurethane Nicks
and<00:02:46.599> I'm<00:02:46.810> putting<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.290> heavy<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> foam

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and I'm putting it on heavy with a foam

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.370 
and I'm putting it on heavy with a foam
brush<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.849> then<00:02:49.000> wiping<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.510> off<00:02:49.630> so<00:02:50.319> you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
brush and then wiping it off so you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
brush and then wiping it off so you
could<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.430> grain<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.910> wood

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
could kind of see the grain of the wood

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.660 
could kind of see the grain of the wood
and<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.989> kind<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.349> gives<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.709> rustic<00:02:53.920> feel

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
and it kind of gives it a rustic feel

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.870 
and it kind of gives it a rustic feel
I<00:02:55.020> cut<00:02:56.020> out<00:02:56.050> 12<00:02:56.530> small<00:02:56.770> little<00:02:57.220> squares<00:02:57.610> of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
I cut out 12 small little squares of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.729 
I cut out 12 small little squares of
wood<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.420> drilled<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.930> hole<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.410> center<00:02:59.709> of

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
wood and drilled a hole in the center of

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.830 
wood and drilled a hole in the center of
it<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.489> using<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> same<00:03:01.120> drill<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
it then using the same drill that I
