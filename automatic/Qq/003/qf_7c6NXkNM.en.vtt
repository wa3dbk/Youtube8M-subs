00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
once we have our two files downloaded

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.780 
once we have our two files downloaded
what<00:01:30.770> we're<00:01:30.890> gonna<00:01:30.980> do<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.370> we're<00:01:31.490> gonna<00:01:31.550> open

what we're gonna do is we're gonna open

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.450 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna open
up<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.120> base<00:01:32.620> we're<00:01:33.620> gonna<00:01:33.710> take<00:01:33.980> that<00:01:34.130> we're

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
up the base we're gonna take that we're

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.760 
up the base we're gonna take that we're
gonna<00:01:34.580> put<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> left<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.650> follow<00:01:36.650> this

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
gonna put it on the left I follow this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.220 
gonna put it on the left I follow this
format<00:01:37.130> all<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> time<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.820> find<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.900> tends<00:01:39.110> to

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
format all the time I find it tends to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.270 
format all the time I find it tends to
make<00:01:39.380> things<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.620> little<00:01:39.740> bit<00:01:39.890> easier<00:01:40.159> to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
make things a little bit easier to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.160 
make things a little bit easier to
follow<00:01:40.430> along<00:01:40.730> with<00:01:40.940> I'm<00:01:41.659> gonna<00:01:41.780> take<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
follow along with I'm gonna take the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.390 
follow along with I'm gonna take the
patch<00:01:42.440> files<00:01:42.770> we're<00:01:42.920> gonna<00:01:43.010> put<00:01:43.190> them<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.310> the
