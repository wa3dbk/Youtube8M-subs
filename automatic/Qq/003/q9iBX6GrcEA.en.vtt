basically follow this path and you'll be

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
basically follow this path and you'll be
fine<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> idea<00:00:39.629> being<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.800> won't<00:00:41.460> turn

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
fine the idea being they won't turn

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
fine the idea being they won't turn
around<00:00:41.910> unless<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> place<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.170> the

is the next section the other side of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
is the next section the other side of
the<00:00:48.210> school<00:00:48.559> there's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> couple<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the school there's a couple of guys you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.139 
the school there's a couple of guys you
can<00:00:51.379> blend<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> left

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can blend in with up here on the left

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.380 
can blend in with up here on the left
and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.449> don't<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> quite<00:00:55.559> quickly<00:00:55.800> enough<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and I don't do it quite quickly enough I

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
and I don't do it quite quickly enough I
think<00:00:57.390> I'll<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.930> haven't<00:00:58.190> burned<00:00:59.190> as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
think I'll have but I haven't burned as

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.529 
think I'll have but I haven't burned as
long<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
long as you do that and even if you do

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
long as you do that and even if you do
that<00:01:00.750> once<00:01:01.230> you've<00:01:01.379> blended<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:02.010> be

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that once you've blended it's gonna be

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.149 
that once you've blended it's gonna be
fine<00:01:02.370> run<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.120> corner<00:01:04.070> around<00:01:05.070> the

fine run up to this corner around the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.640 
fine run up to this corner around the
corner<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> next<00:01:06.090> crowd<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.530> up

see William Hickey after these guys stop

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.740 
see William Hickey after these guys stop
faffing<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.840> outside<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.540> you've<00:01:15.689> got

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
faffing about outside now if you've got

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
faffing about outside now if you've got
super<00:01:16.409> quick<00:01:16.619> reflexes<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> actually

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
super quick reflexes you can actually

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
super quick reflexes you can actually
just<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> monster<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> mission<00:01:19.619> I'll<00:01:20.189> show

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
just and monster this mission I'll show

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.990 
just and monster this mission I'll show
you<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:23.150> there<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.720> um<00:01:26.000> but

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you how here there you go done um but

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
you how here there you go done um but
not<00:01:27.840> everyone<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> able<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> do

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
not everyone is going to be able to do

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
not everyone is going to be able to do
that<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> can't<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that so if you can't this is the way you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
that so if you can't this is the way you
do<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> slowed<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.390> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
do it now I slowed down here and I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
do it now I slowed down here and I
shouldn't<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.780> done<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
shouldn't have done and so the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.200 
shouldn't have done and so the
difference<00:01:35.130> between<00:01:35.189> catching<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.030> not

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
difference between catching and them not

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.660 
difference between catching and them not
is<00:01:36.420> basically<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:37.020> slowing<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is basically me slowing down there but

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
is basically me slowing down there but
you<00:01:38.759> run<00:01:39.000> straight<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.630> instead<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you run straight here instead of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
you run straight here instead of
actually<00:01:40.439> following<00:01:40.619> him<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> you'll<00:01:41.640> cut

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
actually following him and you'll cut

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.310 
actually following him and you'll cut
back<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.329> him<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.570> dodge<00:01:42.810> around<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> back<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
back on him and dodge around the back of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.389 
back on him and dodge around the back of
these<00:01:43.500> stairs<00:01:44.060> careful<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
these stairs careful because you want to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.920 
these stairs careful because you want to
stay<00:01:47.549> close<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> stairs<00:01:48.540> otherwise

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
stay close to the stairs otherwise

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
stay close to the stairs otherwise
you'll<00:01:49.170> lose<00:01:49.380> him<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.799> you'll<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
you'll lose him but you'll see you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
you'll lose him but you'll see you
intercept<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> hadn't<00:01:52.079> worked

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
intercept in here and if I hadn't worked

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
intercept in here and if I hadn't worked
that<00:01:52.500> first<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.950> I've<00:01:53.159> run<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.579> him<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that first bit I've run into him and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
that first bit I've run into him and
tackled<00:01:54.270> him<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.140> did<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> once<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
tackled him and I did it once but and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
tackled him and I did it once but and
hit<00:01:56.250> someone<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.390> again<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hit someone and I did it here again and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.880 
hit someone and I did it here again and
hit<00:01:57.930> someone<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.899> couldn't<00:02:00.899> face<00:02:01.170> restarting

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
hit someone and couldn't face restarting

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
hit someone and couldn't face restarting
again<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> general<00:02:02.820> idea

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
again but that's the general idea

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.500 
again but that's the general idea
anyway<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.320> useful
