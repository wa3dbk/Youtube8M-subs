one<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.590> when<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.340> few<00:01:24.640> pounds<00:01:25.000> of

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
one and when you have a few pounds of

them send them off they send you a check
that's<00:01:27.940> just<00:01:28.150> easier<00:01:28.480> for<00:01:28.510> me<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.800> let's<00:01:30.640> take

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
that's just easier for me so let's take

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.690 
that's just easier for me so let's take
a<00:01:30.820> closer<00:01:31.090> look<00:01:31.300> at<00:01:31.450> some<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.630> these<00:01:31.720> guys<00:01:32.700> all

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
a closer look at some of these guys all

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.290 
a closer look at some of these guys all
right<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.720> was<00:01:35.020> asked<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.940> show<00:01:36.940> how<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.150> take

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
right so I was asked to show how to take

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.690 
right so I was asked to show how to take
these<00:01:37.390> little<00:01:37.510> gold-plated<00:01:38.080> things<00:01:38.290> out<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
these little gold-plated things out and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.840 
these little gold-plated things out and
the<00:01:40.420> only<00:01:40.600> way<00:01:40.900> that<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:44.850> that's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
the only way that I know of is that's

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.870 
the only way that I know of is that's
really<00:01:46.270> time-consuming<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:47.170> difficult<00:01:47.880> but

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
really time-consuming and difficult but

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.420 
really time-consuming and difficult but
it<00:01:49.030> gets<00:01:49.150> them<00:01:49.330> out<00:01:49.680> original<00:01:50.680> feets<00:01:50.890> also<00:01:51.250> has

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
it gets them out original feets also has

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
it gets them out original feets also has
a<00:01:51.630> video<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.660> this<00:01:53.020> where<00:01:53.229> he<00:01:53.350> uses<00:01:53.650> like<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.729> pic

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
a video on this where he uses like a pic

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.190 
a video on this where he uses like a pic
but<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:58.300> stick<00:01:58.479> them<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.810> pair<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.020> vise

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
but I just stick them in a pair of vise

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.320 
but I just stick them in a pair of vise
grips<00:01:59.229> with<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.710> nice<00:01:59.830> and<00:01:59.979> tight<00:02:00.210> fold<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
grips with a nice and tight fold the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.000 
grips with a nice and tight fold the
vice<00:02:01.479> grips<00:02:01.750> down<00:02:01.960> with<00:02:02.110> one<00:02:02.290> hand<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.830> then

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
vice grips down with one hand and then

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.880 
vice grips down with one hand and then
use<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.750> small<00:02:04.750> flat-head<00:02:05.170> screwdriver<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
use a small flat-head screwdriver and

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.600 
use a small flat-head screwdriver and
you<00:02:09.070> just<00:02:09.220> push<00:02:09.520> them<00:02:09.640> up

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you just push them up

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.530 
you just push them up
you<00:02:12.600> got<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:12.900> them<00:02:12.990> one<00:02:13.140> at<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.350> time<00:02:14.540> which

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
you got to do them one at a time which

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.839 
you got to do them one at a time which
is<00:02:15.720> tedious<00:02:16.580> but

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
is tedious but

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.540 
is tedious but
when<00:02:19.359> they<00:02:19.480> pop<00:02:19.719> right<00:02:20.019> out

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
when they pop right out

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.390 
when they pop right out
so<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.960> work<00:02:23.080> for<00:02:23.410> very<00:02:23.680> small<00:02:24.100> pieces

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
so a lot of work for very small pieces

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.550 
so a lot of work for very small pieces
of<00:02:24.720> gold-bearing<00:02:25.720> material

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
of gold-bearing material

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.860 
of gold-bearing material
granted<00:02:27.100> these<00:02:27.190> are<00:02:27.450> completely<00:02:28.450> plated

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
granted these are completely plated

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.280 
granted these are completely plated
there's<00:02:29.740> there's<00:02:30.010> no<00:02:30.510> other<00:02:31.510> metal<00:02:31.870> exposed

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
there's there's no other metal exposed

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.400 
there's there's no other metal exposed
on<00:02:32.560> them<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.430> something<00:02:34.210> like<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.570> would<00:02:35.380> be

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
on them so something like this would be

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.380 
on them so something like this would be
difficult<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.980> process<00:02:36.220> with<00:02:36.490> AP<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.270> to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
difficult to process with AP you have to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.670 
difficult to process with AP you have to
use<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.750> reverse<00:02:38.170> electroplating<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.650> or

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
use like a reverse electroplating so or

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
use like a reverse electroplating so or
I<00:02:42.070> suppose<00:02:43.030> or<00:02:43.150> some<00:02:43.300> other<00:02:43.510> method<00:02:43.690> with

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
I suppose or some other method with

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.660 
I suppose or some other method with
hyper<00:02:44.110> nitric<00:02:44.590> acid<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.160> don't<00:02:45.310> use<00:02:45.460> that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
hyper nitric acid but I don't use that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.420 
hyper nitric acid but I don't use that
so<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.850> won't<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.630> able<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.900> tell<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.950> how<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> do

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
so I won't be able to tell you how to do

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.720 
so I won't be able to tell you how to do
that<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.770> again<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.220> put<00:02:51.400> them<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.580> vise

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that but again you put them in a vise

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:02.090 
that but again you put them in a vise
grip<00:02:51.960> take<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:52.990> screwdriver

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:11.710 

you<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.400> put<00:03:02.640> them<00:03:02.760> through

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.850 

don't<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.020> on<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.230> wife's<00:03:13.440> dining<00:03:13.770> room

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
don't do this on your wife's dining room

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.860 
don't do this on your wife's dining room
tables<00:03:14.190> we'll<00:03:14.310> kill<00:03:14.490> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
tables we'll kill you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.750 
tables we'll kill you
okay<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.530> also<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.099> bag<00:03:17.310> there's<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.580> couple

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
okay so also this bag there's a couple

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.720 
okay so also this bag there's a couple
of<00:03:17.910> other<00:03:18.000> different<00:03:18.090> ones<00:03:19.310> there's<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
of other different ones there's this

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.970 
of other different ones there's this
which<00:03:21.540> looks<00:03:21.569> like<00:03:21.870> some<00:03:22.140> kind<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.319> SVG<00:03:22.800> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
which looks like some kind of SVG a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.420 
which looks like some kind of SVG a
cable<00:03:23.580> or<00:03:23.700> something<00:03:24.830> I'm<00:03:25.830> not<00:03:26.010> actually<00:03:26.250> sure

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
cable or something I'm not actually sure

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.600 
cable or something I'm not actually sure
probably<00:03:27.030> via<00:03:27.720> keyboard<00:03:27.959> something<00:03:28.739> now<00:03:29.370> but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
probably via keyboard something now but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.600 
probably via keyboard something now but
if<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.760> look<00:03:29.910> at<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> outside<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:32.040> outside

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
if you look at the outside the outside

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.440 
if you look at the outside the outside
of<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.150> gold-plated<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:36.299> can

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
of it is gold-plated so that you can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.070 
of it is gold-plated so that you can
literally<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:37.019> pinch<00:03:37.650> off<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.129> pair<00:03:38.340> of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
literally just pinch off with a pair of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.289 
literally just pinch off with a pair of
wire<00:03:40.080> cutters<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:41.819> doesn't<00:03:42.120> need<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.269> be

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
wire cutters it doesn't need to be

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.740 
wire cutters it doesn't need to be
pretty<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> there's<00:03:44.580> that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
pretty so there's that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.420 
pretty so there's that
then<00:03:46.260> you're<00:03:46.410> left<00:03:46.560> with<00:03:46.710> these<00:03:46.800> little<00:03:47.010> gold

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
then you're left with these little gold

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.020 
then you're left with these little gold
plated<00:03:47.700> pins<00:03:47.880> inside<00:03:48.710> with<00:03:49.710> those<00:03:49.920> again<00:03:50.700> same

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
plated pins inside with those again same

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.670 
plated pins inside with those again same
wire<00:03:51.240> cutters<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.780> just<00:03:54.200> lightly<00:03:55.200> grab<00:03:55.560> them

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
wire cutters I just lightly grab them

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.420 
wire cutters I just lightly grab them
and<00:03:55.920> then<00:03:56.250> pull<00:03:56.460> up<00:03:57.830> okay<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:58.950> these<00:03:59.040> are<00:03:59.100> just

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
and then pull up okay and these are just

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.710 
and then pull up okay and these are just
gonna<00:03:59.520> snip<00:04:01.610> use<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> pair<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:02.880> pliers<00:04:02.940> instead

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.500 

normally<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.410> doesn't<00:04:07.530> happen

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.030 

all<00:04:11.930> right<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:12.470> pair<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:12.980> pliers<00:04:13.220> onto<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> pin

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
all right so pair of pliers onto the pin

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.219 
all right so pair of pliers onto the pin
and<00:04:16.040> then<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.239> pull<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> pin<00:04:17.900> out<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:20.229> there

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
and then just pull the pin out and there

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.560 
and then just pull the pin out and there
it<00:04:21.320> is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
it is

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.400

I'm going to do is I'm going to use my

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.040 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use my
wire<00:04:54.740> cutters<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:55.400> trim<00:04:55.669> some<00:04:56.509> of<00:04:56.569> the<00:04:56.660> plastic

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
wire cutters to trim some of the plastic

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.320 
wire cutters to trim some of the plastic
above<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.770> pin<00:04:59.800> because<00:05:00.800> they<00:05:01.400> are<00:05:01.789> shaped

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
above the pin because they are shaped

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.370 
above the pin because they are shaped
wider<00:05:02.889> on<00:05:03.889> top<00:05:04.280> I've<00:05:04.550> got<00:05:04.849> to<00:05:04.940> pull<00:05:05.120> them<00:05:05.240> out

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
wider on top I've got to pull them out

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.620 
wider on top I've got to pull them out
this<00:05:06.380> way<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:06.860> not<00:05:07.009> through<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.310> bottom

so there you go and that's some nice

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.350 
so there you go and that's some nice
little<00:05:15.960> pins<00:05:16.460> completely<00:05:17.460> gold-plated<00:05:17.940> which

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
little pins completely gold-plated which
