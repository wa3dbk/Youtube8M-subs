hello<00:00:33.000> everyone<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.750> San<00:00:33.930> react<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
hello everyone I'm in San react and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
hello everyone I'm in San react and
today<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.770> taking<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.309> look<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
today we are taking a look at a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.299 
today we are taking a look at a
community<00:00:36.149> map<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.710> time<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
community map and this time it is a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
community map and this time it is a
minigame<00:00:38.879> rather<00:00:39.239> than<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.780> flood<00:00:40.170> map<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
minigame rather than a flood map so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.869 
minigame rather than a flood map so
something<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.430> different

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
something a little bit different

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.540 
something a little bit different
hopefully<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.510> guys<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.899> mind<00:00:43.160> but<00:00:44.160> anyway

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
hopefully you guys don't mind but anyway

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
hopefully you guys don't mind but anyway
this<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.030> technically<00:00:45.690> based<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
this one is technically based on the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
this one is technically based on the
flood<00:00:47.039> rule<00:00:47.280> set<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> does<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> flood

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
flood rule set it does use the flood

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
flood rule set it does use the flood
mechanics<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.230> you'll<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.800> quite

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mechanics but as you'll see it is quite

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
mechanics but as you'll see it is quite

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
looking hard enough but as far as I can

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
looking hard enough but as far as I can

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
tell this is something new at least to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
tell this is something new at least to
me<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.900> interesting<00:01:13.140> game

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
me and it's a pretty interesting game

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
me and it's a pretty interesting game
mode<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.040> pretty<00:01:14.159> scary<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
mode it's actually pretty scary I had a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
mode it's actually pretty scary I had a
bunch<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> fun<00:01:15.570> playing<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
bunch of fun playing this and you know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.219 
bunch of fun playing this and you know
something<00:01:17.909> about<00:01:18.060> crouching<00:01:18.689> inside<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.140> an

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
something about crouching inside of an

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
something about crouching inside of an
object<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.740> still<00:01:19.920> being<00:01:20.100> able<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> see

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
object but still being able to see

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
object but still being able to see
outside<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.420> makes<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> whole<00:01:21.840> lot

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
outside of it just makes it a whole lot

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.929 
outside of it just makes it a whole lot
scarier<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> flood

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
scarier because you can see the flood

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
scarier because you can see the flood
coming<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> distance<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.979> they

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
coming from a distance and when they

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.499 
coming from a distance and when they
start<00:01:26.280> getting<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.700> close<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
start getting pretty close you have to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
start getting pretty close you have to
kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> decide<00:01:28.020> whether<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> cut<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.829> run<00:01:28.890> or

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
kind of decide whether to cut and run or

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
kind of decide whether to cut and run or
just<00:01:29.549> try<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> hold<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.240> ground<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.840> if

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
just try to hold your ground and see if

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
just try to hold your ground and see if
they<00:01:31.020> pass<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> flood<00:01:33.150> they

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
they pass you by and as a flood they

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
they pass you by and as a flood they
played<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> few<00:01:34.890> times<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> flood<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
played this a few times as a flood and I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
played this a few times as a flood and I
don't<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.829> couldn't<00:01:38.070> really

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
don't know what it was I couldn't really

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
don't know what it was I couldn't really
remember<00:01:38.490> where<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> different<00:01:39.450> hiding

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
remember where all the different hiding

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
remember where all the different hiding
spots<00:01:39.930> were<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> never<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.159> found<00:01:41.310> them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
spots were and I never really found them

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
spots were and I never really found them
all<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.360> allows<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> variety<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
all which allows a lot of variety and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.319 
all which allows a lot of variety and
different<00:01:44.009> strategies<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> humans<00:01:45.149> they

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
different strategies for the humans they

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.179 
different strategies for the humans they
could<00:01:45.509> hide<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.500> different<00:01:46.740> kinds<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
could hide in all different kinds of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.450 
could hide in all different kinds of
places<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.729> possibly<00:01:48.630> win<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:50.189> starts

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
places and possibly win and it starts

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.920 
places and possibly win and it starts
off<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.909> seeker<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> bunch<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
off with one seeker and a bunch of

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.630 
off with one seeker and a bunch of
humans<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> seeker<00:01:53.070> kills<00:01:53.280> people

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
humans and as the seeker kills people

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.050 
humans and as the seeker kills people
that<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> converted<00:01:54.390> into<00:01:54.630> new<00:01:54.990> seekers<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
that can converted into new seekers and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
that can converted into new seekers and
it<00:01:57.060> gets<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.570> scary<00:01:57.810> towards<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> end<00:01:58.409> we

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it gets kind of scary towards the end we

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
it gets kind of scary towards the end we
