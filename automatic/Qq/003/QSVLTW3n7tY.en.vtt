00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi friends so today we're going to talk

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi friends so today we're going to talk
about<00:00:02.730> material<00:00:03.510> chaining<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:04.950> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
about material chaining this is the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.700 
about material chaining this is the
fastest<00:00:05.850> way<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.120> get<00:00:06.420> any<00:00:06.629> kind<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:07.020> planetary

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
fastest way to get any kind of planetary

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.820 
fastest way to get any kind of planetary
materials<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.849> might<00:00:09.030> want<00:00:09.740> once<00:00:10.740> you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
materials that you might want once you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.230 
materials that you might want once you
get<00:00:10.889> everything<00:00:11.280> set<00:00:11.550> up<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.000> you'll

be netting around three to four hundred
materials<00:00:15.240> per<00:00:15.480> hour<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
materials per hour I know this is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.849 
materials per hour I know this is
especially<00:00:17.850> nice<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.690> you're<00:00:19.050> saving<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.680> your

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
especially nice if you're saving up your

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.310 
especially nice if you're saving up your
vanguard<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.369> crucible<00:00:20.880> marks<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.900> house<00:00:22.109> of

vanguard and crucible marks for house of
wolves<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> also<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> nice

wolves and you want to also get a nice

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.189 
wolves and you want to also get a nice
stash<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.199> materials<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.949> top<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.199> from

stash of materials on top of that from

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.750 
stash of materials on top of that from
now<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.130> ignore<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
now you can actually just ignore the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
now you can actually just ignore the
video<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.240> background<00:00:30.800> first<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.099> just

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
video in the background first one just

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.920 
video in the background first one just
want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.610> over<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.790> couple<00:00:33.030> quick<00:00:33.360> mechanics

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
want to go over a couple quick mechanics

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.319 
want to go over a couple quick mechanics
of<00:00:34.079> how<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.739> work<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.000> sure<00:00:36.149> you've

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
of how this will work so I'm sure you've

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.479 
of how this will work so I'm sure you've
activated<00:00:36.630> materials<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> chests<00:00:37.980> before

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
activated materials and chests before

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.540 
activated materials and chests before
you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.780> once<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> open<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.550> other

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you know that once you open them other

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
you know that once you open them other
players<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> chance<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> open<00:00:43.079> those

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
players will have a chance to open those

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.740 
players will have a chance to open those
as<00:00:43.469> well<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.160> they'll<00:00:44.309> disappear

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
as well and then they'll disappear

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
as well and then they'll disappear
material<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.140> lasts<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.710> 60

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
material is actually lasts for 60

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
material is actually lasts for 60
seconds<00:00:47.610> before<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.030> disappear<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> chest

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
seconds before they disappear and chest

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
seconds before they disappear and chest
will<00:00:49.649> last<00:00:49.829> 20<00:00:50.100> seconds<00:00:50.430> before<00:00:50.579> they

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
will last 20 seconds before they

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
will last 20 seconds before they
disappear<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.110> we're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> patrol

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
disappear now if we're going to patrol

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
disappear now if we're going to patrol
by<00:00:53.219> ourselves<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.899> use<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
by ourselves we can actually make use of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.040 
by ourselves we can actually make use of
these<00:00:55.469> mechanics<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.600> open<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
these mechanics because if you open a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.860 
these mechanics because if you open a
material<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.829> chest<00:00:59.190> then<00:01:00.059> fly<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
material or chest then fly to a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
material or chest then fly to a
different<00:01:01.500> zone<00:01:01.879> any<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> materials<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
different zone any of the materials and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
different zone any of the materials and
chest<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.439> open<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.430> reset<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> their

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
chest that you open will reset to their

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
chest that you open will reset to their
unopened<00:01:06.810> state<00:01:07.110> assuming<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
unopened state assuming that they

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.539 
unopened state assuming that they
haven't<00:01:08.549> already<00:01:08.700> disappeared<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.340> sure

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
haven't already disappeared so I'm sure

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
haven't already disappeared so I'm sure
you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.479> how<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.500> take

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you can kind of see how we can take

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.490 
you can kind of see how we can take
advantage<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.880> opening<00:01:15.659> chests<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
advantage of that by opening chests and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
advantage of that by opening chests and
materials<00:01:16.979> lining<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> different<00:01:18.119> zone<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
materials lining to a different zone and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
materials lining to a different zone and
then<00:01:18.540> coming<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:18.950> they'll<00:01:19.950> still<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.310> there

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
then coming back they'll still be there

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
then coming back they'll still be there
and<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> keep<00:01:21.420> doing<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.810> over<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> over

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and we can keep doing that over and over

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
and we can keep doing that over and over
again<00:01:22.939> however<00:01:23.939> before<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> there's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
again however before we do that there's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440 
again however before we do that there's
two<00:01:25.290> steps<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.240> sure

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
two steps you want to take to make sure

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
two steps you want to take to make sure
everything<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.960> set<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.290> correctly<00:01:28.460> first<00:01:29.460> we

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
everything is set up correctly first we

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.719 
everything is set up correctly first we
want<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> patrol<00:01:30.420> by<00:01:30.810> ourselves<00:01:31.729> ps4

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
want to get a patrol by ourselves ps4

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.210 
want to get a patrol by ourselves ps4
users<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:34.140> easy<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:34.710> doing

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
users will have a really easy time doing

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.499 
users will have a really easy time doing
this<00:01:35.400> they<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.229> their

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
this they can actually just go to their

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.440 
this they can actually just go to their
ps4<00:01:39.509> settings<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.680> date<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> time<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> then

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
ps4 settings then date and time and then

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
ps4 settings then date and time and then
set<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> time<00:01:43.020> manually<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
set the time manually I'm going to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950 
set the time manually I'm going to
change<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> date<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.570> any<00:01:45.689> previous

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
change the date back to any previous

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280 
change the date back to any previous
state<00:01:46.470> confirm<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.729> back<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> destiny<00:01:48.290> then

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
state confirm it go back to destiny then

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
state confirm it go back to destiny then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can see we've already been working

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
here on the moon on the second step and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.690 
here on the moon on the second step and
that<00:02:36.359> is<00:02:36.480> simply<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:37.079> push<00:02:37.709> materials<00:02:38.459> from

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that is simply to push materials from

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
that is simply to push materials from
one<00:02:38.970> side<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> map<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.829> other<00:02:41.010> and

one side of the map to the other and

one side of the map to the other and
that<00:02:41.969> is<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.420> kind<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.659> get<00:02:42.780> them<00:02:42.930> all

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
that is to kind of get them all

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.530 
that is to kind of get them all
concentrated<00:02:43.799> as<00:02:43.980> close<00:02:44.220> as<00:02:44.400> possible<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.970> a

loading point between zones to do that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.179 
loading point between zones to do that
is<00:02:48.659> a<00:02:48.689> very<00:02:48.989> simple<00:02:49.170> process<00:02:49.530> you're<00:02:50.010> just

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
is a very simple process you're just

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.640 
is a very simple process you're just
going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.579> open<00:02:51.049> materials<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.169> chests<00:02:52.530> on

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
going to open materials and chests on

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.740 
going to open materials and chests on
one<00:02:52.889> side<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:53.569> eventually<00:02:54.569> they'll<00:02:54.720> start

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
one side and eventually they'll start

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.309 
one side and eventually they'll start
spawning<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.310> other<00:02:56.459> side<00:02:57.049> kind<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.079> close

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
spawning on the other side kind of close

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.440 
spawning on the other side kind of close
together<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.639> that<00:02:59.819> we<00:02:59.849> can<00:03:00.060> open<00:03:00.180> them

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
together here so that we can open them

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.890 
together here so that we can open them
all<00:03:00.599> at<00:03:00.750> once<00:03:00.780> i<00:03:01.739> chose<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.909> left<00:03:03.329> side<00:03:03.540> as

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
all at once i chose the left side as

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170 
all at once i chose the left side as
where<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> wanted<00:03:04.919> my<00:03:05.129> materials<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.909> spawn

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
where I wanted my materials to spawn

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.770 
where I wanted my materials to spawn
because<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.319> loading<00:03:07.799> point<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
because the loading point from the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.420 
because the loading point from the
archers<00:03:10.109> line<00:03:10.349> here<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.919> Hellmouth<00:03:11.189> is

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
archers line here to the Hellmouth is

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.369 
archers line here to the Hellmouth is
much<00:03:11.760> shorter<00:03:11.939> travel<00:03:12.299> distance<00:03:12.810> than

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
much shorter travel distance than

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.360 
much shorter travel distance than

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
archers line to the anchor of light so

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680 
archers line to the anchor of light so
as<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.699> can<00:03:17.849> see<00:03:18.120> we've<00:03:18.299> actually<00:03:18.510> already

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
as you can see we've actually already

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.960 
as you can see we've actually already
started<00:03:19.409> our<00:03:19.530> run<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:20.159> with<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.519> first

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
started our run here with that first

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.240 
started our run here with that first
helium<00:03:21.449> filament<00:03:21.900> coil<00:03:22.169> inside<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.159> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
helium filament coil inside of the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.390 
helium filament coil inside of the
building<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.729> just<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.419> outside<00:03:25.400> there

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
building and just on the outside there

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.789 
building and just on the outside there
that<00:03:26.579> we<00:03:26.669> just<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.810> get<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.199> one<00:03:28.379> inside

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
that we just got and get this one inside

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.830 
that we just got and get this one inside
then<00:03:29.099> we're<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> get<00:03:29.519> our<00:03:29.669> chest<00:03:29.940> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
then we're going to get our chest so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.809 
then we're going to get our chest so
this<00:03:31.349> is<00:03:31.530> not<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:31.919> an<00:03:32.010> optimal<00:03:32.489> run<00:03:32.669> only

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
this is not really an optimal run only

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.300 
this is not really an optimal run only
has<00:03:33.090> three<00:03:33.329> materials<00:03:33.900> however<00:03:34.859> this<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
has three materials however this is a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.640 
has three materials however this is a
great<00:03:35.729> spot<00:03:36.090> for<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.510> chest<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.139> if<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.440> wanted

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
great spot for the chest so if we wanted

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.890 
great spot for the chest so if we wanted
to<00:03:37.709> get<00:03:37.889> one<00:03:38.069> more<00:03:38.099> material<00:03:38.729> will<00:03:39.419> be<00:03:39.449> pretty

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
to get one more material will be pretty

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.379 
to get one more material will be pretty
much<00:03:39.989> perfect<00:03:40.590> remember<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.639> have<00:03:41.849> 60

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
much perfect remember that we have 60

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.240 
much perfect remember that we have 60
seconds<00:03:42.810> from<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.229> first<00:03:43.470> time<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.859> open<00:03:44.190> a

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
seconds from the first time we open a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.180 
seconds from the first time we open a
material<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:44.970> 20<00:03:45.959> seconds<00:03:46.349> from<00:03:46.799> opening

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
material and 20 seconds from opening

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.280 
material and 20 seconds from opening
that<00:03:47.340> chest<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.720> loading<00:03:49.049> point

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that chest to get to the loading point

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.759 
that chest to get to the loading point
here<00:03:49.760> once<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.940> see<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.359> title<00:03:52.079> pop<00:03:52.319> up<00:03:52.560> for

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
here once we see the title pop up for

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.250 
here once we see the title pop up for
the<00:03:52.829> hell<00:03:52.979> mount<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.699> there<00:03:53.970> has<00:03:54.269> everything

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the hell mount and there has everything

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
the hell mount and there has everything
that<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.709> open<00:03:56.010> will<00:03:56.189> be<00:03:56.310> reset<00:03:56.819> as<00:03:57.329> long<00:03:57.510> as<00:03:57.540> we

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
that we open will be reset as long as we

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.059 
that we open will be reset as long as we
made<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.079> there<00:03:58.199> in<00:03:58.229> time<00:03:58.349> when<00:03:58.739> they<00:03:58.799> didn't

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
made it there in time when they didn't

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.399 
made it there in time when they didn't
disappear<00:03:59.519> we<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.389> go<00:04:00.510> collect<00:04:00.930> them<00:04:01.079> again

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
disappear we can go collect them again

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.390 
disappear we can go collect them again
so<00:04:02.189> let's<00:04:02.430> go<00:04:02.579> back<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.090> check<00:04:03.449> our<00:04:04.400> first

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
so let's go back and check our first

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.309 
so let's go back and check our first
helium<00:04:05.939> filament<00:04:06.389> coil<00:04:06.599> inside<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
helium filament coil inside of the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.149 
helium filament coil inside of the
building<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:08.000> it's<00:04:09.000> there<00:04:09.620> everything<00:04:10.620> went

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
building and it's there everything went

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.850 
building and it's there everything went
correctly

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
correctly

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.979 
correctly
right<00:04:13.640> down<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.740> here<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.570> can

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
right down and here it is and you can

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.660 
right down and here it is and you can
really<00:04:18.320> do<00:04:18.440> this<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.739> any<00:04:18.920> planet<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:19.519> we'll

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
really do this on any planet so we'll

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.270 
really do this on any planet so we'll
try<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.910> here<00:04:20.150> on<00:04:20.269> Venus<00:04:20.690> next<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.799> this<00:04:22.010> works

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
try it here on Venus next and this works

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.830 
try it here on Venus next and this works
out<00:04:22.430> pretty<00:04:22.580> well<00:04:22.730> for<00:04:22.880> us<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.330> actually<00:04:23.660> get<00:04:23.810> a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
out pretty well for us we actually get a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.070 
out pretty well for us we actually get a
for<00:04:24.320> material<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.160> one<00:04:25.910> Chester<00:04:26.450> on<00:04:26.600> here<00:04:26.930> so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
for material and one Chester on here so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.970 
for material and one Chester on here so
that's<00:04:27.260> pretty<00:04:27.500> much<00:04:27.710> optimal<00:04:29.830> something<00:04:30.830> to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
that's pretty much optimal something to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.160 
that's pretty much optimal something to
note<00:04:31.010> when<00:04:31.640> you're<00:04:31.880> pushing<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.600> materials

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
note when you're pushing the materials

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.220 
note when you're pushing the materials
to<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.620> side<00:04:33.920> is<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.670> there<00:04:35.360> are<00:04:35.390> about<00:04:35.750> five

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
to one side is that there are about five

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.500 
to one side is that there are about five
materials<00:04:36.980> present<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.490> map<00:04:37.700> at<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.940> time<00:04:38.180> in

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
materials present on a map at a time in

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.360 
materials present on a map at a time in
two<00:04:39.170> or<00:04:39.290> three<00:04:39.320> chests<00:04:39.800> both<00:04:40.070> of<00:04:40.280> those

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
two or three chests both of those

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.110 
two or three chests both of those
depending<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.120> size<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.900> map<00:04:43.120> what

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
depending on the size of the map what

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.300 
depending on the size of the map what
that<00:04:44.300> means<00:04:44.600> for<00:04:44.690> us<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.740> we<00:04:46.040> start

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
that means for us is that as we start

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.550 
that means for us is that as we start
pushing<00:04:46.669> materials<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> one<00:04:47.390> side<00:04:47.660> it's<00:04:48.440> going

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
pushing materials to one side it's going

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.190 
pushing materials to one side it's going
to<00:04:48.650> get<00:04:48.770> harder<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.400> harder<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:50.570> find<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
to get harder and harder to find the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.070 
to get harder and harder to find the
stragglers<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.340> left<00:04:52.610> on<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.660> side<00:04:53.870> we

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
stragglers that are left on the side we

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.110 
stragglers that are left on the side we
don't<00:04:54.320> want<00:04:54.530> them<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:55.460> if<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.730> get<00:04:55.850> three

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
don't want them so if you get three

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.750 
don't want them so if you get three
materials<00:04:56.630> on<00:04:56.750> one<00:04:56.930> side<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.500> chest<00:04:57.800> that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
materials on one side and the chest that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.980 
materials on one side and the chest that
should<00:04:59.000> be<00:04:59.120> fun<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.540> don't<00:04:59.630> want<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.870> waste

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
should be fun you don't want to waste

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.640 
should be fun you don't want to waste
too<00:05:00.200> much<00:05:00.320> time<00:05:00.700> finding<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.850> last<00:05:02.150> one<00:05:02.650> if

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
too much time finding that last one if

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.650 
too much time finding that last one if
you're<00:05:04.430> not<00:05:04.580> going<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.790> be<00:05:04.910> farming<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.419> for

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
you're not going to be farming this for

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.260 
you're not going to be farming this for
a<00:05:05.690> long<00:05:05.930> time<00:05:06.040> now<00:05:07.040> three<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.850> chest<00:05:08.060> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
a long time now three and a chest is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.830 
a long time now three and a chest is
fine<00:05:08.480> or<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.169> chest<00:05:09.440> this<00:05:09.650> is<00:05:10.010> great<00:05:10.430> as<00:05:10.610> well

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
fine or in a chest this is great as well

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.320 
fine or in a chest this is great as well
either<00:05:11.840> way<00:05:12.290> it'll<00:05:12.590> work<00:05:13.030> you'll<00:05:14.030> notice<00:05:14.300> that

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
either way it'll work you'll notice that

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.680
