00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.900 

pretty<00:00:29.230> much<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:29.740> whole<00:00:29.770> area<00:00:30.430> you<00:00:30.730> don't

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
there's only one place where I would

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.020 
there's only one place where I would
ever<00:00:36.129> dare<00:00:36.430> do<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:36.970> we'll<00:00:37.210> see<00:00:37.360> that<00:00:37.480> later<00:00:39.030> but

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
ever dare do it we'll see that later but

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.060 
ever dare do it we'll see that later but
your<00:00:40.480> weapon<00:00:40.840> just<00:00:41.019> doesn't<00:00:41.440> come<00:00:41.590> back<00:00:41.830> very

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070

often<00:00:42.839> and<00:00:43.839> if<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.050> die<00:00:44.230> in<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.470> wrong<00:00:44.650> spot

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
often and if you die in the wrong spot

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.570 
often and if you die in the wrong spot
you<00:00:46.420> probably<00:00:46.989> will<00:00:47.230> never<00:00:47.320> get<00:00:47.620> out<00:00:47.800> of<00:00:47.830> the

before<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.069> release<00:02:15.520> ideas<00:02:15.849> springboards<00:02:16.569> we

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
before I release ideas springboards we

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.140 
before I release ideas springboards we

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.490 

massive<00:02:53.080> jumping<00:02:53.680> off<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:55.209> last<00:02:55.510> water<00:02:55.959> level

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
massive jumping off the last water level

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:30.730 
massive jumping off the last water level
yet<00:02:56.769> hey<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.670> sick<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.239> after<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.630> while

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.240 

just<00:03:31.670> about<00:03:31.850> every<00:03:32.330> platform<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:33.170> gonna<00:03:33.290> fall

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:46.810 

it's<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.460> to<00:03:37.550> think<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.300> way<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:46.670> of

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
it's just to think of it that way and of

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.460 
it's just to think of it that way and of
course<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.450> see<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.900> hardly<00:03:48.170> any<00:03:48.380> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
course this is I see that hardly any of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:01.210 
course this is I see that hardly any of
them<00:03:48.560> drop<00:03:49.540> make<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.720> none<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.960> them

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.270 

okay<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.430> there<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.150> go

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
okay that there we go

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.630 
okay that there we go
tricky<00:04:05.280> jump<00:04:05.549> with<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.909> fish<00:04:06.180> as<00:04:06.360> well<00:04:07.640> anyway

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
tricky jump with the fish as well anyway

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.679 
tricky jump with the fish as well anyway
that's<00:04:08.879> not<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> point

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
that's not the point

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.530 
that's not the point
the<00:04:09.900> real<00:04:10.079> point<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.680> level<00:04:11.069> is<00:04:11.540> point

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
the real point of this level is point

the real point of this level is point

this<00:04:25.110> ferry<00:04:26.060> provides<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.210> huge<00:04:27.600> pile<00:04:27.930> of

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
this ferry provides a huge pile of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.029 
this ferry provides a huge pile of
points<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.780> also<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> last<00:04:31.320> good<00:04:31.650> scoring

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
points it's also the last good scoring

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.219 
points it's also the last good scoring
opportunity<00:04:32.789> in<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.030> game<00:04:34.910> therefore<00:04:36.229> we're

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
opportunity in the game therefore we're

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.439 
opportunity in the game therefore we're
gonna<00:04:37.289> waste<00:04:37.650> all<00:04:37.860> of<00:04:38.010> our<00:04:38.160> guys<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.639> this<00:04:38.910> I

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.120 

understand<00:04:42.449> that<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:43.050> be<00:04:43.410> rather<00:04:43.830> difficult

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
understand that to be rather difficult

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.529 
understand that to be rather difficult
to<00:04:44.430> finish<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.820> game<00:04:45.030> now<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:46.130> honestly<00:04:47.539> if

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
to finish the game now but honestly if

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.159 
to finish the game now but honestly if
you<00:04:48.690> die<00:04:48.930> later<00:04:49.320> on<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.800> game<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:51.360> what<00:04:51.539> the

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
you die later on in the game so what the

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.600 
you die later on in the game so what the
game<00:04:52.350> ends<00:04:52.590> when<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.800> get<00:04:52.979> to<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.250> end<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
game ends when you get to the end of the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.830 
game ends when you get to the end of the
last<00:04:53.789> stage<00:04:56.030> supposed<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.419> points

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
last stage supposed to get the points

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.230 
last stage supposed to get the points
and<00:04:58.530> die<00:04:58.830> than<00:04:59.220> not<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.580> have<00:04:59.639> gotten<00:04:59.970> them<00:05:00.120> at

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
and die than not to have gotten them at

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.950 
and die than not to have gotten them at
all<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:01.880> let's<00:05:02.880> fast<00:05:03.180> forward<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.630> bit<00:05:03.660> we're<00:05:03.870> in

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
all so let's fast forward a bit we're in

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.180 
all so let's fast forward a bit we're in
add<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.229> couple<00:05:04.560> more<00:05:04.740> times

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190
