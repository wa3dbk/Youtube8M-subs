00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello everyone from books all over again 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 here the car broke up with ours we'll see 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 today 's issue of how to follow a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 song sung on the good chart is the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.680
 accompaniment of a song sung to the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.250
 The accordion basically consists of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.930
 movement of chords in the right hand and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.129
 in maintaining the rhythm of music 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.430
 we'll see then how to avoid this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430
 rhythm 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 we will use our right hand when 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.579
 to play and for this we will use the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.960
 rhythm of the call 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.960
 Let's start working on the license. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.470
 We are going to study the song chorus. 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.049
 Merry cheer is not first let's go 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:18.810
 a little bit at the pace that the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:28.280
 briefcase one measure 686 terms 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.280
 on leashes as the left 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 2nd to cut in time 345 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:00.060
 let's go where they are located 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:04.579
 these new ones in the bay where we all 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:12.670
 we have here the tonic after all the stock 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:16.830
 down outside you have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.370
 the March button we call from below 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.150
 just above it we have the chord with 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.120
 the tickets 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.280
 so you have here on those two buttons 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.980
 closing you have the tone bigger tone 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:41.050
 down rock and now opening you have 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:43.510
 made to do only the most cutting and side 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:52.260
 from inside also at the bottom you 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.260
 You have here the sun contribution largest down 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.799
 we will see then how the population of the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.580
 than the average 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.580
 we are going to tell 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:17.530
 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and we're going 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:21.130
 articulate ours as envisaged by 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.410
 which we now turn to the right 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.200
 Let's see what chords we're going to 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 need to accompany the singer to him 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.850
 belongs to 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.850
