00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.339
 i 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 the difference is and I for example to this 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 image with the settings I will approve by 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 example to see what comes here the tone 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.619
 saturation I 'm going to this 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.279
 directly to change the tone 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.279
 saturation 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.900
 but change well 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.390
 okay 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.150
 I would like to change this now 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.430
 I can not know what values ​​you applied 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.780
 I just already have that image changed 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 but I do not know what job values ​​or 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 nothing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.150
 what the difference rid let them 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 here 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 is that I would be in a top layer myself 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.010
 Here I tell you how I want to change 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.050
 before that changed with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.690
 color balance 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.630
 good change the image 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.829
 so 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.829
 with this layer 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 from here you see I change the photograph to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.830
 what I want to change tonality and 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.770
 everything but if at any given time he threw me 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.900
 back only he turned off and it's 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.000
 or if I say well I did not want it to be 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.000
 so green I want it more yellow 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.700
 I change it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.740
 and it is already 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.970
 so the good thing about this is that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.020
 when we our initial image 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 it is completely 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.480
 in the rough, no, we do not change it or anything 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 it can even happen to you that you do 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.399
 settings of those and you like on screen 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 and when you go to print the photo what 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.540
 that you see on your screen some tones 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.090
 greenish you can print it and the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.250
 printer that comes out in blue says 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.540
 that this is not what I wanted to adjust it 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.810
 until a little bit and you turn it to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 take 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.910
 if you had done it without a layer of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.310
 these you have to be looking for again 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.180
 to see write down on a paper that you exist 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.180
 a mess like that you can always change it 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.159
 the times you want and also the good 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.280
 not only that but as we said 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.840
 apart from that we can add it 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 everyone we want here for example 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 See, I put it on, it was yellow 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.100
 but in turn I say and then I find it 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.820
 a little 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.560
 this image as having low brightness 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.830
 I want to shine it because I put it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.830
 brightness 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.150
 and it just gets here on top and it's 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.150
 affecting also
