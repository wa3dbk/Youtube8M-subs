00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929 

here<00:00:00.840> I'm<00:00:00.989> having<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.920> very<00:00:02.220> simple<00:00:02.639> indoor

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
here I'm having a very simple indoor

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.900 
here I'm having a very simple indoor
scene<00:00:03.120> lit<00:00:03.540> entirely<00:00:04.140> by<00:00:04.650> an<00:00:04.830> HDR<00:00:05.310> eye<00:00:05.400> from

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
scene lit entirely by an HDR eye from

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.750 
scene lit entirely by an HDR eye from
the<00:00:06.060> outside<00:00:06.450> from<00:00:06.660> open<00:00:07.170> footage<00:00:07.529> dotnet<00:00:08.099> and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the outside from open footage dotnet and

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.660 
the outside from open footage dotnet and
after<00:00:09.210> 20<00:00:09.540> samples<00:00:09.719> it's<00:00:10.710> still<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.190> noisy<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
after 20 samples it's still so noisy and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.270 
after 20 samples it's still so noisy and
you<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:12.059> barely<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.200> small<00:00:13.590> character

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
you can barely see that small character

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.240 
you can barely see that small character
I've<00:00:14.429> put<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.820> there<00:00:15.030> but<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> right

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I've put in there but here on the right

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
I've put in there but here on the right
hand<00:00:17.279> side<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.150> new<00:00:18.750> magic<00:00:19.230> switch

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
hand side there is a new magic switch

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.509 
hand side there is a new magic switch
it's<00:00:20.220> called<00:00:20.430> portal<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.570> when<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> turn<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> on

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
it's called portal and when I turn it on

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
it's called portal and when I turn it on
you<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.699> things<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.210> clearing<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.689> way

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you see things are clearing up way

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.960 
you see things are clearing up way
faster<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> after<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:26.070> 20<00:00:26.369> samples<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.910> can

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
faster and after just 20 samples you can

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.140 
faster and after just 20 samples you can
even<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.320> small<00:00:28.859> monkey<00:00:29.400> I've<00:00:29.760> put<00:00:30.029> in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
even see the small monkey I've put in

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.790 
even see the small monkey I've put in
there<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.189> what<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.759> magic<00:00:33.420> doing<00:00:33.809> well

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there so what is this magic doing well

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.170 
there so what is this magic doing well
basically<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.730> portal<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.680> guide<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.730> light

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
basically a portal is a guide for light

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.250 
basically a portal is a guide for light
in<00:00:39.510> cycles<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.280> tell<00:00:41.579> cycles<00:00:42.570> where

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in cycles and it would tell cycles where

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.700 
in cycles and it would tell cycles where
openings<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.700> an<00:00:44.879> interior<00:00:45.149> scene<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
openings are in an interior scene so the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
openings are in an interior scene so the
race<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.219> search<00:00:47.610> their<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:47.940> through<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
race can search their way through the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
race can search their way through the
opening<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> delight<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.680> outside<00:00:51.770> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
opening and to delight from outside the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
opening and to delight from outside the
way<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> set<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.969> using<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.480> aerial

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
way to set it up is by using an aerial

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.160 
way to set it up is by using an aerial
lamp<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.890> cannot<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.399> he<00:00:56.640> might<00:00:56.879> spot<00:00:57.360> Sun<00:00:57.960> or

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
lamp you cannot use he might spot Sun or

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
lamp you cannot use he might spot Sun or
Point<00:00:58.500> lamps<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.149> already<00:01:00.329> done<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
Point lamps and I have already done to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.070 
Point lamps and I have already done to
see<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.199> let<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.680> delete<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.080> show

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
see a but let me delete this and show

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
see a but let me delete this and show
you<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> set<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you how to set it up right from the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530 
you how to set it up right from the
beginning<00:01:06.510> let<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.320> add<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.710> lamp<00:01:08.119> area<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
beginning let me add a lamp area and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
beginning let me add a lamp area and
first<00:01:10.409> let's<00:01:10.650> move<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> outside<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:12.979> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
first let's move it outside and then we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
first let's move it outside and then we
need<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.549> point<00:01:14.990> towards<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.500> inside<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
need it to point towards the inside of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
need it to point towards the inside of
our<00:01:17.670> room<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> case<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:20.180> rotate<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
our room so in this case just rotate it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.490 
our room so in this case just rotate it
90<00:01:21.720> degrees<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.610> should<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.380> inside<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
90 degrees and it should be inside the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
90 degrees and it should be inside the
wall<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.049> where<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
wall so this is where it will have the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.600 
wall so this is where it will have the
most<00:01:29.100> effect<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.740> planting<00:01:31.740> pear<00:01:32.070> placing<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
most effect so planting pear placing it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
most effect so planting pear placing it
inside<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.090> wall<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.960> should<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.320> be

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
inside the wall and it should also be

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.550 
inside the wall and it should also be
roughly<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> middle<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.670> our<00:01:35.820> window

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
roughly in the middle of our window

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.130 
roughly in the middle of our window
because<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.829> I'll<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.729> bigger<00:01:39.079> until<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because now I'll make it bigger until it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
because now I'll make it bigger until it
covers<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.040> entire<00:01:41.220> window<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.600> okay

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
covers the entire window and it's okay

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.270 
covers the entire window and it's okay
if<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.259> bigger<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> window

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
if it's a little bigger than the window

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.999 
if it's a little bigger than the window
that<00:01:44.939> doesn't<00:01:45.270> matter<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.990> most<00:01:46.530> important

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that doesn't matter the most important

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
that doesn't matter the most important
thing<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.909> covers<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.509> entirely<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
thing is that it covers it entirely so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.600 
thing is that it covers it entirely so
basically<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.909> area<00:01:51.180> lamp<00:01:51.540> has<00:01:51.810> closed

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
basically now this area lamp has closed

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
basically now this area lamp has closed
another<00:01:53.610> hole<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.060> our<00:01:54.630> mesh<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.570> now<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
another hole in our mesh and now when I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
another hole in our mesh and now when I
go<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:59.060> render<00:02:00.060> view<00:02:01.219> everything<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.490> very

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
go to render view everything is very

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.209 
go to render view everything is very
bright<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.930> aerial<00:02:04.649> end<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.040> still

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
bright because the aerial end is still

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.570 
bright because the aerial end is still
set<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> normal<00:02:06.090> emission<00:02:06.680> now<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> turn

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
set to normal emission now when I turn

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.860 
set to normal emission now when I turn
on<00:02:08.610> portal<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.770> disappears<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.360> becomes<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
on portal it disappears and becomes a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
on portal it disappears and becomes a
portal<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.500> all

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
portal for all

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.090 
portal for all
instead<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.910> reduces<00:02:15.360> our<00:02:15.570> noise<00:02:16.100> one

little<00:02:17.430> tip<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.360> multiple<00:02:19.020> windows

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
little tip if I have multiple windows

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.890 
little tip if I have multiple windows
and<00:02:19.950> they're<00:02:20.130> inside<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.490> same<00:02:20.760> wall<00:02:21.060> choose

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and they're inside the same wall choose

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.740 
and they're inside the same wall choose
just<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:23.010> area<00:02:23.310> lamp<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.970> cover<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.390> all<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
just one area lamp to cover them all of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.510 
just one area lamp to cover them all of
them<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:25.020> once<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.830> way<00:02:26.010> better<00:02:26.190> than

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
them at once that's way better than

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.090 
them at once that's way better than
using<00:02:27.060> multiple<00:02:27.660> portals<00:02:28.020> because<00:02:28.530> each

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
using multiple portals because each

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.250 
using multiple portals because each
portal<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:29.910> increase<00:02:30.390> render<00:02:31.050> time<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
portal will increase render time a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.100 
portal will increase render time a
little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.850> next<00:02:32.850> thing<00:02:33.150> I'd<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.870> show

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
little bit next thing I'd like to show

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.900 
little bit next thing I'd like to show
you<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> numerable<00:02:35.130> option<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you is the numerable option for the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.420 
you is the numerable option for the
panoramic<00:02:36.450> camera<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.650> let<00:02:37.800> me<00:02:37.920> first<00:02:38.070> select

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
panoramic camera so let me first select

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.190 
panoramic camera so let me first select
the<00:02:38.520> camera<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.570> here<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> camera

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the camera and here in the camera

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.560 
the camera and here in the camera
settings<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:41.130> have<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> option<00:02:41.790> panoramic

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
settings we have the option panoramic

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.500 
settings we have the option panoramic
and<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.580> old<00:02:44.820> options<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.330> fish

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and you know the old options like fish

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
and you know the old options like fish
are<00:02:45.630> equals<00:02:45.990> solid<00:02:46.260> efficient<00:02:46.740> equidistant

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
are equals solid efficient equidistant

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390 
are equals solid efficient equidistant
and<00:02:47.550> equal<00:02:48.000> rectangular<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.410> behold<00:02:49.830> for

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and equal rectangular but now behold for

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.150 
and equal rectangular but now behold for
the<00:02:50.520> new<00:02:50.670> option<00:02:51.060> mirror<00:02:51.360> ball<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.890> actually

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the new option mirror ball and actually

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520 
the new option mirror ball and actually
it<00:02:53.550> looks<00:02:53.730> very<00:02:54.150> similar<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.600> fish<00:02:54.870> eye<00:02:55.080> but

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it looks very similar to fish eye but

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.979 
it looks very similar to fish eye but
it's<00:02:55.770> actually<00:02:56.160> exactly<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.120> opposite<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
it's actually exactly the opposite it's

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.740 
it's actually exactly the opposite it's
as<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.920> world<00:02:59.160> photograph<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.209> mirror

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
as if you world photograph and mirror

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.130 
as if you world photograph and mirror
ball<00:03:01.040> while<00:03:02.040> fish<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.790> more<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.570> if<00:03:03.959> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
ball while fish is more like if you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.240 
ball while fish is more like if you
would<00:03:04.350> use<00:03:04.530> an<00:03:04.860> extreme<00:03:05.489> wide-angle<00:03:05.790> lens<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
would use an extreme wide-angle lens and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.600 
would use an extreme wide-angle lens and
of<00:03:08.250> course<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.989> best<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.650> use<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
of course it is best to use with a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.270 
of course it is best to use with a
square<00:03:12.300> resolution<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.050> now<00:03:13.739> you'll<00:03:13.890> clearly

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
square resolution and now you'll clearly

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.640 
square resolution and now you'll clearly
see<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.670> mirror<00:03:15.060> ball<00:03:15.300> here<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.750> there<00:03:16.470> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
see the mirror ball here and there is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.580 
see the mirror ball here and there is
software<00:03:16.950> out<00:03:17.310> there<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.700> requires<00:03:18.690> Mirabal

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
software out there that requires Mirabal

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.240 
software out there that requires Mirabal
for<00:03:20.430> panoramic<00:03:21.090> images<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.070> before<00:03:23.070> we<00:03:23.160> had

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
for panoramic images and before we had

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250 
for panoramic images and before we had
this<00:03:23.370> option<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.820> cycles<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.510> had<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.930> render

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
this option in cycles you had to render

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.050 
this option in cycles you had to render
it<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.470> example<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.010> equal<00:03:26.370> rectangular<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it for example in equal rectangular and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.759 
it for example in equal rectangular and
then<00:03:27.239> use<00:03:27.420> an<00:03:27.570> external<00:03:28.019> tool<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.350> convert<00:03:28.620> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
then use an external tool to convert it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.370 
then use an external tool to convert it
to<00:03:28.799> my<00:03:28.980> robot<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> option<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
to my robot now we have the option to a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.530 
to my robot now we have the option to a
render<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.040> mirror<00:03:32.280> ball<00:03:32.519> directly<00:03:33.060> which<00:03:33.299> of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
render to mirror ball directly which of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.130 
render to mirror ball directly which of
course<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.989> way<00:03:34.500> better
