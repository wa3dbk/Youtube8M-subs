00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
simple song i believe the cores are the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
simple song i believe the cores are the
same<00:00:20.010> throughout<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:21.510> only<00:00:21.689> thing<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
same throughout the only thing that it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830 
same throughout the only thing that it
is<00:00:22.289> fingerpicking<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> i<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.269> try<00:00:24.600> my<00:00:24.810> best

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
is fingerpicking so i will try my best

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.580 
is fingerpicking so i will try my best
to<00:00:26.390> show<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> how<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> chords<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to show you how the chords go on how the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.190 
to show you how the chords go on how the
finger-picking<00:00:29.400> goes<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> chords<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:34.040> C

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
finger-picking goes so the chords are C

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.600 
finger-picking goes so the chords are C
and<00:00:37.879> then<00:00:38.879> you'll<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.540> move<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:40.610> I'm

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and then you'll just move over I'm

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.549 
and then you'll just move over I'm
actually<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:42.120> sure<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.050> code<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually not sure what this code is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.690 
actually not sure what this code is
called<00:00:43.860> needs<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.940> variation<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> CC<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> C<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
called needs a variation of CC of C and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.780 
called needs a variation of CC of C and
then<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> move<00:00:48.180> over

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.840 

then<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.660> a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
then you have a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.850 
then you have a
hey

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:14.580 

I<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:03.250> bar<00:01:03.640> deaf<00:01:03.820> but<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.920> can<00:01:06.100> do<00:01:06.780> any<00:01:07.780> F<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
I a bar deaf but you can do any F so so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
I a bar deaf but you can do any F so so
the<00:01:14.770> picking<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:18.180> C<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.380> you've<00:01:20.830> got<00:01:21.330> these

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the picking so C so you've got these

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520 
the picking so C so you've got these
three<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.340> one

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
three not this one

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.210 

it's<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.580> way<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.729> do<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.070> actually

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
it's the way I do it is so you actually

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.640 
it's the way I do it is so you actually
will<00:01:33.610> hit<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:33.970> one<00:01:34.210> Sophie

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.560 

and<00:01:41.650> that's<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> basic<00:01:42.700> picking<00:01:43.180> pattern

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
and that's the basic picking pattern

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.859 
and that's the basic picking pattern
throughout<00:01:43.960> he'll<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:44.890> some<00:01:45.450> move<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.780> your

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
throughout he'll just some move for your

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.929 
throughout he'll just some move for your
chords<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:48.009> don't<00:01:48.189> know<00:01:48.280> if<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.610> see<00:01:48.909> it

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
chords so I don't know if you can see it

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.970 
chords so I don't know if you can see it
but<00:01:49.330> it'll<00:01:49.509> be

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.970 

then<00:01:55.580> you'll<00:01:55.730> switch<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.930> other<00:01:57.200> see

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
then you'll switch to the other see

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.380 
then you'll switch to the other see
variation

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.919 

you'll<00:02:04.170> make<00:02:04.380> sure<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.680> hit<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.070> bottle<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
you'll make sure you hit this bottle and

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.090 
you'll make sure you hit this bottle and
the<00:02:09.929> only<00:02:10.080> thing<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.770> different

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the only thing that will be different

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.620 
the only thing that will be different
with<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.819> you'll<00:02:11.970> hear<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.240> in<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> song

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
with this is you'll hear it in the song

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.150 
with this is you'll hear it in the song
but<00:02:12.990> it'll<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.230> you'll<00:02:16.380> put<00:02:16.560> your<00:02:16.590> pinky

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
but it'll be a so you'll put your pinky

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.710 
but it'll be a so you'll put your pinky
on<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.319> B<00:02:19.319> string<00:02:19.520> fourth<00:02:20.520> fret<00:02:20.640> we'll<00:02:21.570> just

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
on the B string fourth fret we'll just

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.530 
on the B string fourth fret we'll just
put<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:21.959> pinky<00:02:22.320> down<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.100> it'll<00:02:23.220> sound<00:02:23.490> like

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.250 

so<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.790> you'll<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.689> a<00:02:37.719> it's<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so then you'll go on to the a it's the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.790 
so then you'll go on to the a it's the
same<00:02:38.530> picking<00:02:38.950> pattern

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.040 

f

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
if you want to see it from the cords

00:02:48.600 --> 00:03:06.550 
if you want to see it from the cords
it'll<00:02:49.590> be

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:18.160 

pinky

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.820
