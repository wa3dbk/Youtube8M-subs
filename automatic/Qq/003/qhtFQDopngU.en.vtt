00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.369 
anatomy for circulatory system the thing
just<00:02:00.940> takes<00:02:01.239> forever<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.599> open<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.140> once<00:02:02.259> it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:02.379 
just takes forever to open and once it

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.130 
just takes forever to open and once it
does<00:02:02.649> there's<00:02:03.340> no<00:02:03.819> pinching<00:02:04.239> zooming<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.959> mean

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
does there's no pinching zooming I mean

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.660 
does there's no pinching zooming I mean
you<00:02:05.289> try<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.530> navigate<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.429> just

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
you try to navigate and it's just

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.229 
you try to navigate and it's just
absolutely<00:02:07.660> painfully<00:02:08.530> slow<00:02:08.819> yeah<00:02:09.819> so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
absolutely painfully slow yeah so

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.360 
absolutely painfully slow yeah so
there's<00:02:10.690> been<00:02:10.899> two<00:02:11.140> generations<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:12.069> color

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
there's been two generations of color

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.300 
there's been two generations of color
egg<00:02:12.849> there's<00:02:13.150> been<00:02:13.360> Triton<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.129> then

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
egg there's been Triton a one and then

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.059 
egg there's been Triton a one and then
the<00:02:15.700> most<00:02:15.910> recent<00:02:16.060> Triton<00:02:16.959> two<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.829> not

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
the most recent Triton two are not

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.009 
the most recent Triton two are not
really<00:02:18.489> much<00:02:18.670> has<00:02:18.849> changed<00:02:18.879> with<00:02:19.510> each

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
really much has changed with each

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.089 
really much has changed with each
generation

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
generation

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.759

an additional layer and a diamond kite
the<00:02:24.129> resolution<00:02:24.760> has<00:02:24.879> been<00:02:25.120> relatively<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the resolution has been relatively the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.979 
the resolution has been relatively the
same<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.280> we've<00:02:27.670> not<00:02:27.909> really<00:02:28.180> seen<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.659> lot<00:02:28.959> of

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
same and we've not really seen a lot of

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.080 
same and we've not really seen a lot of
innovation<00:02:29.829> when<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.040> comes<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.459> eating<00:02:30.670> we've

talked to a lot of a meter companies

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.229 
talked to a lot of a meter companies

terrible I mean it does there's only
about<00:04:36.550> four<00:04:36.880> thousand<00:04:37.389> colors<00:04:37.660> displayed

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
about four thousand colors displayed

about four thousand colors displayed
which<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.830> essence<00:04:39.160> everything<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.610> looks

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
which in essence everything just looks

the the contrast is super high and
everything's<00:04:44.530> fuzzy<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:46.389> just<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.080> just

about it because they don't really do
anything<00:05:01.479> with<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.530> color<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.100> since<00:05:03.699> you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
anything with the color and since you

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.700 
anything with the color and since you
can't<00:05:04.060> really<00:05:04.240> make<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.810> fast<00:05:05.289> enough<00:05:05.560> to

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
can't really make it you fast enough to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.999 
can't really make it you fast enough to

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
play a game at 24 30 60 frames a second

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.040 
play a game at 24 30 60 frames a second
because<00:05:09.430> as<00:05:09.639> your<00:05:09.820> Angry<00:05:10.389> Bird<00:05:10.570> you<00:05:10.840> would

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
because as your Angry Bird you would

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.420 
because as your Angry Bird you would
throw<00:05:11.289> it<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.530> would<00:05:11.650> go<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:11.830> this

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
throw it it would go like this

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.920 
throw it it would go like this
and<00:05:12.520> then<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.759> would<00:05:12.910> stall<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.509> page<00:05:13.720> will

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
and then it would stall the page will

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.570 
and then it would stall the page will
flash<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.440> he<00:05:14.530> would<00:05:14.650> already<00:05:14.800> be<00:05:14.949> ended<00:05:15.370> he

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
flash and he would already be ended he

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.830 
flash and he would already be ended he
would<00:05:15.669> already<00:05:15.820> end<00:05:16.060> up<00:05:16.150> at<00:05:16.300> where<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.570> pigs

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
would already end up at where the pigs

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.379 
would already end up at where the pigs
are<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:18.070> can't<00:05:18.340> make<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.729> readers<00:05:19.000> fluid

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
are so you can't make you readers fluid

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.650 
are so you can't make you readers fluid
enough<00:05:19.599> especially<00:05:20.020> on<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:21.250> 10-inch<00:05:22.000> ereader

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
enough especially on a 10-inch ereader

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.689 
enough especially on a 10-inch ereader
like<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:22.990> jet<00:05:23.199> book<00:05:23.380> color<00:05:23.620> with<00:05:24.039> an<00:05:24.220> 800

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
like the jet book color with an 800

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.640 
like the jet book color with an 800

so<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:28.060> just<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.870> don't<00:05:29.020> know<00:05:29.199> I<00:05:29.229> mean<00:05:29.500> it's<00:05:29.800> we've

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
so I just I don't know I mean it's we've

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.800 
so I just I don't know I mean it's we've
seen<00:05:30.400> two<00:05:30.669> generations<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.479> it<00:05:31.660> the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
seen two generations of it the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.540 
seen two generations of it the
pocketbook<00:05:32.259> color<00:05:32.440> Lux<00:05:32.710> I<00:05:32.889> think<00:05:33.130> has<00:05:33.250> done<00:05:33.430> it

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
pocketbook color Lux I think has done it

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.740 
pocketbook color Lux I think has done it
the<00:05:33.580> best<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.150> only<00:05:34.300> say<00:05:34.570> that<00:05:34.720> because

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
the best and I only say that because

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.450 
the best and I only say that because
it's<00:05:35.020> 200<00:05:35.349> bucks<00:05:35.530> it's<00:05:36.009> two<00:05:36.130> or<00:05:36.160> three<00:05:36.370> hundred

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
it's 200 bucks it's two or three hundred

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.460 
it's 200 bucks it's two or three hundred
dollars<00:05:36.880> well<00:05:37.060> that's<00:05:37.330> unlike<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.840> $600

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
dollars well that's unlike the $600

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.279 
dollars well that's unlike the $600

channel we have several reviews of it's

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.200 
channel we have several reviews of it's
an<00:05:46.960> 8<00:05:47.110> inch<00:05:47.289> color<00:05:47.560> ink<00:05:47.860> screen<00:05:48.760> it's<00:05:48.940> not<00:05:49.000> too

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
an 8 inch color ink screen it's not too

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.290 
an 8 inch color ink screen it's not too
bad<00:05:49.360> but<00:05:49.630> other<00:05:50.320> than<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.620> I<00:05:51.039> mean<00:05:51.460> it's<00:05:52.030> it's

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
bad but other than that I mean it's it's

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.659 
bad but other than that I mean it's it's
remained<00:05:52.930> roughly<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.680> same<00:05:53.889> for<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.370> long

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
remained roughly the same for a long

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.360 
remained roughly the same for a long
time<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.570> there's<00:05:55.810> two<00:05:56.080> segments<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:56.919> I<00:05:56.979> feel

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
time so there's two segments that I feel

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.629 
time so there's two segments that I feel
that<00:05:57.400> color<00:05:58.210> eatin<00:05:58.720> could<00:05:58.960> really<00:05:59.139> shine<00:05:59.639> one

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
that color eatin could really shine one

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.749 
that color eatin could really shine one
of<00:06:00.760> them<00:06:00.909> is<00:06:01.120> smartwatches<00:06:01.840> yeah<00:06:02.710> now<00:06:02.919> as<00:06:03.310> the

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
of them is smartwatches yeah now as the

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.779 
of them is smartwatches yeah now as the
pebble<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:04.659> Sony<00:06:04.990> SmartWatch<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:06.070> the

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
pebble and the Sony SmartWatch and the

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.420 
pebble and the Sony SmartWatch and the
Galaxy<00:06:07.449> gear<00:06:07.750> have<00:06:07.960> showed<00:06:08.320> us<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:08.770> most<00:06:09.220> of

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
Galaxy gear have showed us that most of

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.570 
Galaxy gear have showed us that most of
these<00:06:09.580> phones<00:06:10.240> using<00:06:10.630> LCD<00:06:11.470> or<00:06:11.580> touchscreen

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
these phones using LCD or touchscreen

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.320 
these phones using LCD or touchscreen
only<00:06:13.509> lasts<00:06:14.349> you<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.590> few<00:06:15.099> days<00:06:15.280> max<00:06:15.669> before<00:06:16.090> you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
only lasts you a few days max before you

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.060 
only lasts you a few days max before you
have<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.570> recharge<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.139> and<00:06:17.409> I<00:06:17.710> think<00:06:17.770> that

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
have to recharge it and I think that

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.890 
have to recharge it and I think that
this<00:06:18.220> is<00:06:18.370> really<00:06:18.490> kind<00:06:18.820> of<00:06:18.849> hindered<00:06:19.240> adoption

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
this is really kind of hindered adoption

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.659 
this is really kind of hindered adoption
I've<00:06:20.199> really<00:06:20.530> stopped<00:06:20.889> using<00:06:21.130> my<00:06:21.340> pebble

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
I've really stopped using my pebble

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.460 
I've really stopped using my pebble
because<00:06:22.060> I'm<00:06:22.210> tired<00:06:22.449> of<00:06:22.659> charging<00:06:23.169> it<00:06:23.259> like

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
because I'm tired of charging it like

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.770 
because I'm tired of charging it like
every<00:06:23.680> two<00:06:23.919> days<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.430> when<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.610> my<00:06:24.729> Sony<00:06:25.150> yeah

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
every two days and when I my Sony yeah

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.110 
every two days and when I my Sony yeah
and<00:06:25.990> it's<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.620> type<00:06:26.830> of<00:06:26.860> thing<00:06:27.190> where<00:06:27.430> who

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
and it's the type of thing where who

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120 
and it's the type of thing where who
really<00:06:28.449> wants<00:06:28.750> to<00:06:28.810> charge<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.409> every<00:06:29.500> day<00:06:29.800> yeah

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
really wants to charge it every day yeah

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.580 
really wants to charge it every day yeah
whereas<00:06:30.550> with<00:06:30.789> eating<00:06:31.300> training<00:06:31.930> this<00:06:32.259> watch

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
whereas with eating training this watch

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.740 
whereas with eating training this watch
could<00:06:32.979> really<00:06:33.280> last<00:06:33.580> you<00:06:33.909> a<00:06:33.940> few<00:06:34.210> months<00:06:34.570> as

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
could really last you a few months as

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.050 
could really last you a few months as
long<00:06:34.930> as<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.470> your<00:06:35.620> Kindle<00:06:36.009> this<00:06:36.250> or<00:06:36.610> your

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
long as the your Kindle this or your

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.300 
long as the your Kindle this or your
nook<00:06:37.330> does<00:06:37.659> and<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:38.259> think<00:06:38.289> that<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:38.770> wearable

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
nook does and I think that the wearable

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.610 
nook does and I think that the wearable
tech<00:06:39.639> could<00:06:40.060> really<00:06:40.240> shine<00:06:40.630> with<00:06:40.960> Ian<00:06:41.289> trying

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
tech could really shine with Ian trying

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.409 
tech could really shine with Ian trying
to<00:06:41.949> you<00:06:42.220> have<00:06:42.340> rank<00:06:42.610> watch<00:06:42.820> right<00:06:43.090> now

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
to you have rank watch right now

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.240 
to you have rank watch right now
and<00:06:43.510> you<00:06:43.870> never<00:06:44.050> charge<00:06:44.380> that<00:06:44.620> how<00:06:44.950> great

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
and you never charge that how great

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.230 
and you never charge that how great
would<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:45.430> be<00:06:45.669> if<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:45.880> was<00:06:46.000> color<00:06:46.180> yeah

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
would that be if it was color yeah

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.870 
would that be if it was color yeah
exactly<00:06:47.750> or<00:06:47.930> you<00:06:48.349> know<00:06:48.470> having<00:06:48.889> a<00:06:49.069> SmartWatch

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
exactly or you know having a SmartWatch

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.719 
exactly or you know having a SmartWatch
that<00:06:50.270> was<00:06:50.780> solar-powered<00:06:51.620> yeah<00:06:51.830> yeah<00:06:52.490> with

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
that was solar-powered yeah yeah with

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.879 
that was solar-powered yeah yeah with
that<00:06:52.849> technology<00:06:53.240> had<00:06:53.630> a<00:06:53.660> his<00:06:54.259> has<00:06:54.470> a<00:06:54.500> solar

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
that technology had a his has a solar

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.900 
that technology had a his has a solar
panel<00:06:55.819> around<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.810> bezel<00:06:57.199> right<00:06:58.190> inside<00:06:58.729> the

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
panel around the bezel right inside the

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.180 
panel around the bezel right inside the
bezel<00:06:59.060> around<00:06:59.660> the<00:06:59.990> screen<00:07:00.349> and<00:07:00.590> it<00:07:00.889> actually

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
bezel around the screen and it actually

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.370 
bezel around the screen and it actually
charges<00:07:01.639> on<00:07:01.759> different<00:07:02.150> spectrums<00:07:02.690> of<00:07:02.780> UV<00:07:03.139> so

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
charges on different spectrums of UV so

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.870 
charges on different spectrums of UV so
even<00:07:03.590> if<00:07:03.680> it's<00:07:03.800> cloudy<00:07:04.099> out<00:07:04.340> it'll<00:07:04.580> actually

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
even if it's cloudy out it'll actually

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.790 
even if it's cloudy out it'll actually
still<00:07:05.060> charge<00:07:05.330> yeah<00:07:06.080> totally

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
still charge yeah totally

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.920 
still charge yeah totally
so<00:07:07.069> I<00:07:07.099> can<00:07:07.550> see<00:07:07.819> a<00:07:07.849> lot<00:07:08.090> of<00:07:08.240> segments

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
so I can see a lot of segments

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.870 
so I can see a lot of segments
benefiting<00:07:09.680> from<00:07:09.830> color<00:07:10.160> eating<00:07:10.639> that

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
benefiting from color eating that

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.670
