00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
how to get the knobs correct there will

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
how to get the knobs correct there will
be<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> link<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> description<00:00:54.300> below<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:55.020> I

set I mean orange needs to be set to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.999 
set I mean orange needs to be set to
seven<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> yellow<00:01:33.720> needs<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> be<00:01:34.170> set<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> two

and<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.650> thing<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.220> dials<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and the thing about these dials that you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
and the thing about these dials that you
move<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.439> moves<00:01:41.159> different<00:01:41.759> dials<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> if

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
move them it moves different dials so if

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
move them it moves different dials so if
you<00:01:43.920> move<00:01:44.159> purple<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.970> moves<00:01:45.210> blue<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
move blue moves blue purple and orange

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.039 
move blue moves blue purple and orange
if<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.470> move<00:01:52.619> orange<00:01:53.250> dial<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.210> moves<00:01:54.509> orange

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
if you move orange dial and moves orange

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
if you move orange dial and moves orange
blue<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> yellow<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> move<00:01:56.790> yellow

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
blue and yellow and you can move yellow

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
blue and yellow and you can move yellow
and<00:01:58.020> moves<00:01:58.680> yellow<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.579> orange<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.759> thing

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and moves yellow and orange so the thing

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
and moves yellow and orange so the thing
you<00:02:03.090> need<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.820> go<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.780> white

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
you need to do here is go to the white

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.559 
you need to do here is go to the white
house<00:02:08.179> go<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> yellow<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.200> turn<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.129> two

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
house go to yellow and turn it to two

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.640 
house go to yellow and turn it to two
after<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.930> need<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.319> up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
after that you need to go up

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.649 
after that you need to go up
a purple<00:02:14.159> move<00:02:14.939> it<00:02:15.239> nine<00:02:16.519> dials<00:02:17.519> move<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.450> nine

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
a purple move it nine dials move it nine

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.250 
a purple move it nine dials move it nine
times

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
times

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
times
then<00:02:20.040> move<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> blue<00:02:21.349> move<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.560> eight<00:02:22.709> times

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
then move up to blue move it eight times

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.440 
then move up to blue move it eight times
then<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:25.319> back<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.799> yellow<00:02:26.220> move<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:27.209> eight

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
then go back to yellow move that eight

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.640 
then go back to yellow move that eight
