products except there's a couple of
flaws<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> their<00:00:20.730> products<00:00:21.119> and

flaws with some of their products and
I'm<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> tell<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> fix<00:00:24.119> those

I'm here to tell you how to fix those

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.920 
I'm here to tell you how to fix those
problems<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.300> these

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
problems so as you can see on these

axial<00:00:28.710> shocks<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.210> focuses<00:00:32.329> there<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
axial shocks if it focuses there is the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950 
axial shocks if it focuses there is the
piston<00:00:34.559> body<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.670> shaft<00:00:35.969> inside<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.930> a

bottom shock cap and a spring cup I'm

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.700 
bottom shock cap and a spring cup I'm
assuming<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.520> called

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
assuming that so it's called

assuming that so it's called
if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> guys<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> correct<00:00:47.460> me<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.910> ahead

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
if you guys want to correct me go ahead

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
if you guys want to correct me go ahead
I<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.660> care<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> stock

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
I don't really care so on the stock

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
I don't really care so on the stock
axial<00:00:51.539> shock<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.590> spring<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> top

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
axial shock this spring is at the top

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
axial shock this spring is at the top
this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.510> two-stage<00:00:55.050> shock<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:55.890> means

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this is a two-stage shock which means

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is a two-stage shock which means
it's<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:56.910> soft<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> gets

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's really soft and then when it gets

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
it's really soft and then when it gets
down<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> gets<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.920> hard<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
down it gets really hard that way it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
down it gets really hard that way it's
not<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> linear<00:01:01.949> break<00:01:02.550> spring<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> there's<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
not a linear break spring so there's the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.980 
not a linear break spring so there's the
long<00:01:05.729> spring<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.600> spacer<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> short<00:01:08.549> spring

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
long spring a spacer then a short spring

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
long spring a spacer then a short spring
so<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.670> stock<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.270> short

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so what you do is on the stock the short

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
so what you do is on the stock the short
Springs<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> spacer

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
Springs at the top there's a spacer

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
Springs at the top there's a spacer
that's<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.240> around<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:17.280> actually

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that's right around here I'm actually

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
that's right around here I'm actually
going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> use<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> tool<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> point<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.020> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
going to use a tool to point this out so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
going to use a tool to point this out so
my<00:01:19.290> fat<00:01:19.740> fingers<00:01:19.950> don't<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
my fat fingers don't get in the way this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
my fat fingers don't get in the way this
goes<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.880> goes<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:26.159> bottom

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
goes here this goes here and this bottom

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.359 
goes here this goes here and this bottom
the<00:01:26.670> spring<00:01:26.909> goes<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.829> I'm<00:01:28.829> assuming

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the spring goes here I'm assuming

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.679 
the spring goes here I'm assuming
actually<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.759> made<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
actually all made it like that just so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
actually all made it like that just so
it<00:01:30.840> looks<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.170> nice<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.680> don't<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.369> know

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it looks really nice I don't really know

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
it looks really nice I don't really know
if<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.759> changes<00:01:33.150> performance<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.750> doubt<00:01:33.990> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
if this changes performance I doubt it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.730 
if this changes performance I doubt it
does<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> figured<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
does but so I figured out a way to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.280 
does but so I figured out a way to
smooth<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.290> stock

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
smooth it out because what they do stock

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.170 
smooth it out because what they do stock
is<00:01:40.880> they<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.570> coarse

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
is they have very coarse

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
is they have very coarse
shock<00:01:45.180> thread<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.490> more

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
shock thread right here it's a lot more

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.230 
shock thread right here it's a lot more
coarse<00:01:47.970> than<00:01:48.030> most<00:01:48.740> shocks<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.909> happens

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
coarse than most shocks and what happens

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
coarse than most shocks and what happens
is<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.890> spacer<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.250> Gachet<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.979> spacer

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
is this spacer and Gachet this spacer

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.270 
is this spacer and Gachet this spacer
here<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:57.149> rub<00:01:57.360> against<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> making<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
here will rub against that making it not

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
here will rub against that making it not
smooth<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:02.840> compared<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
smooth and go like this like compared to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.419 
smooth and go like this like compared to
us<00:02:04.610> if<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.670> hitting<00:02:06.210> anything<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:07.220> know<00:02:08.220> those

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
us if not hitting anything I know those

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.130 
us if not hitting anything I know those
are<00:02:08.670> very<00:02:08.879> bad<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> way<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> said<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.959> but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
are very bad the way I said that but

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.979 
are very bad the way I said that but
whatever<00:02:10.500> who<00:02:11.009> cares<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> video<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.930> not

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
whatever who cares it's a video it's not

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.960 
whatever who cares it's a video it's not
like<00:02:13.290> I'm

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
like I'm

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.820 
like I'm
making<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.390> presentation<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.320> millions<00:02:15.650> to

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
making a presentation for millions to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.470 
making a presentation for millions to
see<00:02:16.010> oh<00:02:16.250> okay

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
see oh okay

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.670 
see oh okay
so<00:02:17.660> anyways<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.370> these<00:02:19.610> shafts<00:02:20.510> or<00:02:20.840> Springs

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
so anyways so these shafts or Springs

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.350 
so anyways so these shafts or Springs
are<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.310> axial<00:02:22.880> icons<00:02:23.590> shocks<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> they're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
are the axial icons shocks so they're

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.750 
are the axial icons shocks so they're
supposed<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:26.900> an<00:02:26.960> upgraded<00:02:27.350> version<00:02:27.760> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
supposed to be an upgraded version to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280 
supposed to be an upgraded version to
make<00:02:28.790> them<00:02:29.030> feel<00:02:29.210> smoother<00:02:29.780> because<00:02:30.020> they

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
make them feel smoother because they

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.290 
make them feel smoother because they
have<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> titanium<00:02:31.070> nitride<00:02:31.490> coated<00:02:32.030> shaft

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
have the titanium nitride coated shaft

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.190 
have the titanium nitride coated shaft
as<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.900> sort<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.770> see<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:35.210> can't<00:02:35.450> see<00:02:35.510> um

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
as you can sort of see you can't see um

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.400 
as you can sort of see you can't see um
as<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:37.490> see<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.880> there<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:39.050> got<00:02:39.350> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
as you can see in there it's got the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.230 
as you can see in there it's got the
titanium<00:02:40.010> nitride<00:02:40.340> coated<00:02:40.640> shaft<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.060> has<00:02:41.210> a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
titanium nitride coated shaft it has a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.290 
titanium nitride coated shaft it has a
machined<00:02:42.130> piston<00:02:43.130> head<00:02:43.370> somewhere<00:02:43.910> inside<00:02:44.240> of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
machined piston head somewhere inside of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.540 
machined piston head somewhere inside of
here<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.890> think<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.100> right<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
here I think it's like right there and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.850 
here I think it's like right there and
it<00:02:47.030> has<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.270> dual<00:02:52.570> rubber<00:02:53.570> washer<00:02:53.930> system<00:02:54.740> in

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
it has a dual rubber washer system in

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.890 
it has a dual rubber washer system in
here<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.220> keep<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.640> oil<00:02:55.970> from<00:02:56.270> leaking<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.660> I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
here to keep the oil from leaking out I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.180 
here to keep the oil from leaking out I
need<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.800> get<00:02:57.920> new<00:02:59.350> o-rings<00:03:00.350> because<00:03:00.860> my

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
need to get new o-rings because my

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.680 
need to get new o-rings because my
shocks<00:03:01.400> are<00:03:01.580> leaking<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.330> kind<00:03:02.600> of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
shocks are leaking is you can kind of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.940 
shocks are leaking is you can kind of
see<00:03:02.870> there<00:03:04.000> anyways<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.630> what<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.440> you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
see there anyways so what you do is you

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.160 
see there anyways so what you do is you
would<00:03:07.070> take<00:03:07.340> these<00:03:07.550> shocks<00:03:07.850> apart<00:03:08.240> from<00:03:08.750> just

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
would take these shocks apart from just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.510 
would take these shocks apart from just
here<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.590> don't<00:03:09.680> need<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:10.220> from<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
here you don't need to do it from the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.210 
here you don't need to do it from the
here<00:03:11.240> my<00:03:12.080> trucks<00:03:12.380> upside<00:03:12.709> down<00:03:12.830> as<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.100> can

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
here my trucks upside down as you can

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.400 
here my trucks upside down as you can
see<00:03:13.459> now<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.970> I'm<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.020> calling<00:03:15.290> this

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
see now so I'm going to be calling this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.630 
see now so I'm going to be calling this
the<00:03:15.620> bottom<00:03:15.920> even<00:03:16.070> though<00:03:16.280> that's<00:03:16.340> at<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.610> top

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
the bottom even though that's at the top

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.580 
the bottom even though that's at the top
can<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.540> call<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:17.900> even<00:03:18.170> though<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.410> at<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
can we call this even though it's at the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.170 
can we call this even though it's at the
bottom<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:20.480> what<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.260> would<00:03:21.410> do<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:22.519> make<00:03:22.910> this

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
bottom so what you would do to make this

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.440 
bottom so what you would do to make this
a<00:03:23.450> lot<00:03:23.630> more<00:03:23.810> smooth<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.620> would<00:03:24.850> take<00:03:25.850> this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
a lot more smooth is you would take this

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.170 
a lot more smooth is you would take this
apart<00:03:26.810> here<00:03:27.200> with<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.190> screw<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.640> then<00:03:28.940> not

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
apart here with that screw and then not

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.640 
apart here with that screw and then not
there<00:03:29.980> then<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.010> would<00:03:31.280> take<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:32.239> off<00:03:32.650> you

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
there then you would take this off you

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.960 
there then you would take this off you
don't<00:03:33.800> need<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.070> take<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.370> ball<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.730> off<00:03:34.850> you

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
don't need to take the ball and off you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.960 
don't need to take the ball and off you
just<00:03:35.090> need<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.390> take<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.750> cup<00:03:36.080> off<00:03:37.010> then<00:03:37.910> what

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
just need to take the cup off then what

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.540 
just need to take the cup off then what
you<00:03:38.090> do<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.300> you<00:03:38.720> would<00:03:38.870> keep<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.860> normal<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
you do is you would keep this normal and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.910 
you do is you would keep this normal and
just<00:03:40.580> switch<00:03:41.360> these<00:03:41.720> our<00:03:41.989> Springs<00:03:42.530> around

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
just switch these our Springs around

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.180 
just switch these our Springs around
what<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.000> does<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.600> as<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.950> compress<00:03:45.950> it

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
what that does is as you compress it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.729 
what that does is as you compress it
doesn't<00:03:46.489> move<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.090> water<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.200> spacer

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
doesn't move the water the spacer

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.860 
doesn't move the water the spacer
doesn't<00:03:49.070> move<00:03:49.160> over<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.580> threads<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.840> a

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
doesn't move over the threads so it's a

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.070 
doesn't move over the threads so it's a
lot<00:03:51.049> smoother<00:03:51.940> IR<00:03:52.940> air<00:03:53.239> in<00:03:53.390> my<00:03:53.510> shots<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.930> need

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
lot smoother IR air in my shots I need

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.630 
lot smoother IR air in my shots I need
to<00:03:54.170> fix<00:03:54.380> that<00:03:54.560> that's<00:03:54.980> what<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.250> squeaking

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to fix that that's what that squeaking

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.699 
to fix that that's what that squeaking
sound<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:57.489> but<00:03:58.489> um<00:03:59.200> keeps<00:04:00.200> your<00:04:00.410> shocks

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
sound is but um keeps your shocks

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.870 
sound is but um keeps your shocks
running<00:04:01.310> smoother<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.470> less<00:04:03.470> noise<00:04:03.880> because

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
running smoother and less noise because

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.880 
running smoother and less noise because
I'm<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.450> got<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:05.989> annoyed<00:04:06.230> at<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.530> sound<00:04:06.769> of

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
I'm I got really annoyed at the sound of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.660 
I'm I got really annoyed at the sound of
it<00:04:07.010> going<00:04:08.320> like<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.530> every<00:04:10.010> time<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
it going like that every time the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.970 
it going like that every time the
suspension<00:04:11.570> compressed<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.230> haven't<00:04:12.830> actually

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
suspension compressed I haven't actually

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.039 
suspension compressed I haven't actually

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.170 
kind of foggy because I'm going through
the<00:04:23.000> lexan<00:04:23.390> here<00:04:24.400> geeking<00:04:25.400> FXR<00:04:25.849> as<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.060> can

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
the lexan here geeking FXR as you can

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.370 
the lexan here geeking FXR as you can
see<00:04:26.330> no<00:04:26.510> wires<00:04:26.840> are<00:04:27.080> hooked

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
see no wires are hooked

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.180 
see no wires are hooked
except<00:04:27.860> for<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.810> seagull<00:04:29.810> arse<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.890> anyway

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
except for the seagull arse but anyway

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.830 
except for the seagull arse but anyway
so<00:04:31.250> it's<00:04:31.550> not<00:04:31.700> hooked<00:04:31.790> up<00:04:31.970> actually<00:04:32.450> haven't

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
so it's not hooked up actually haven't

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.210

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
ran it but I've been screwing around

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.930

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.410 
to make the shocks feel a little more
smooth<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.890> it<00:04:40.160> didn't<00:04:40.430> feel<00:04:40.940> like<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.270> was

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
smooth so it didn't feel like it was

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.680 
smooth so it didn't feel like it was
binding<00:04:41.720> or<00:04:42.110> anything<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.880> that's<00:04:44.330> my<00:04:44.510> video
