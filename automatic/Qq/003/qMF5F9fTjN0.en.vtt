00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.139
 hello to all and all currencies 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.449
 but it's punchy that today we 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.160
 found for a little tutorial video that 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.920
 will explain how to take the blows 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.320
 francs to about 17 meters to these 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.429
 waters there so it's very simple before 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.929
 of course I have to put the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.740
 free kick so here's the free kick is 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.919
 in place so you just have to 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.989
 before shooting the ball you have to 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.660
 positioned his balloon like this is to 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:36.350
 pretty much who lent on the button r 1 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.880
 so that's their excuse me gmail ps3 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.230
 so for xbox do not know how that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.030
 walk but there you have to click on the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.830
 button and one they shoot you is pretty much 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.750
 close to a bar and a half towards these waters 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.640
 there like these and there normally 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.470
 should be goal and not what we know 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.380
 also where there is goal or there is corner in 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.060
 general 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.850
 so for example we will resume a 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.890
 little example we hope it works 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.890
 here is a little coffee 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.740
 you can smoke game 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.380
 e 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.600
 me also made for the keyzio 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.250
 people tell me that's it did not work 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.030
 but in general it works but most 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.980
 time it works 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.180
 so I hope this tutorial has been 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:20.710
 useful we will try after 25 meters on 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.270
 go see if it works it's flat is there 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.899
 sacred 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.899
 it 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.960
 it's going to be a little harder but it's 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 possible 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.320
 hop there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.150
 you see there is a recovery I think 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.400
 that it is in goal anyway we go 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.670
 try to 10 to 17 m I think it 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670
 market 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.490
 and here is bus amaya baudot 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.390
 find out earlier how to mark on 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.340
