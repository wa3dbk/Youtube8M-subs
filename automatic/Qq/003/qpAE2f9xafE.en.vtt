00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
between as we decided that making

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
stage decorating situation but you don't

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.619 
stage decorating situation but you don't
really<00:00:47.469> need<00:00:47.649> any<00:00:47.859> previous<00:00:48.459> experience

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
really need any previous experience

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
on really from where I left off at

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.580 
on really from where I left off at
school<00:01:48.280> that's<00:01:48.759> not<00:01:49.119> what<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.630> think<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:50.170> really

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
school that's not what I think is really

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.459 
school that's not what I think is really
good<00:01:50.770> about<00:01:50.890> these<00:01:51.310> courses<00:01:51.969> is<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
good about these courses is that the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.319 
good about these courses is that the
students<00:01:54.189> have<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.670> thinking<00:01:55.090> for

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
students have to do thinking for

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.870 
students have to do thinking for
themselves<00:01:55.420> as<00:01:56.140> well<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:57.369> they<00:01:57.490> can<00:01:57.639> put<00:01:57.850> their

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
themselves as well so they can put their

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.230 
themselves as well so they can put their
own<00:01:58.149> ideas<00:01:58.719> forward<00:01:59.560> but<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.639> can<00:02:00.939> come

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
own ideas forward but that you can come

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.109 
own ideas forward but that you can come
without<00:02:01.749> any<00:02:02.020> idea<00:02:02.619> whatsoever<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.969> will

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
without any idea whatsoever but you will

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.870 
without any idea whatsoever but you will
still<00:02:04.389> create<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.590> product<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.490> end<00:02:06.609> anneal

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
still create a product in the end anneal
