note that I did try to put my my actual
GPS<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> thing<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.790> by<00:00:32.790> michael

GPS into this thing and by michael
cheapest<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.600> mean<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.870> TomTom<00:00:34.290> GPS<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.640> was

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
cheapest I mean my TomTom GPS and it was

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.440 
cheapest I mean my TomTom GPS and it was
too<00:00:35.910> big<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.940> wasn't<00:00:39.210> too<00:00:39.270> big

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
too big so that's just it wasn't too big

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.770 
too big so that's just it wasn't too big
buy<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.379> still<00:00:40.530> too<00:00:40.649> big<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
buy too much but it was still too big so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.520 
buy too much but it was still too big so
that's<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> need<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> take

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that's something that you need to take

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.080 
that's something that you need to take
into<00:00:43.680> consideration<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.820> thing<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
into consideration this thing is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
into consideration this thing is
flexible<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.140> flexible<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
flexible but it's only flexible up to a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
flexible but it's only flexible up to a
certain<00:00:46.920> amount<00:00:47.090> now<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> main<00:00:48.329> reason<00:00:48.360> why

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
certain amount now the main reason why

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
certain amount now the main reason why

the 1080p camera on my iPhone 5s and
that<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.280> tried<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.820> tests<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:31.250> my

that I also tried some tests with my
Canon<00:01:32.909> camera<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.420> Canon<00:01:33.720> ELPH<00:01:33.900> camera<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.920> one

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Canon camera my Canon ELPH camera so one

Canon camera my Canon ELPH camera so one
of<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.150> Canon<00:01:36.420> camera<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> better

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of them the Canon camera has a better

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
of them the Canon camera has a better
treat<00:01:37.350> composition<00:01:37.950> built<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.369> naturally<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
treat composition built in naturally to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
treat composition built in naturally to
it<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.079> why<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.710> see

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it so that's why you probably can see

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
it so that's why you probably can see
less<00:01:41.009> shake<00:01:41.280> whereas<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> iPhone<00:01:42.299> doesn't

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
less shake whereas the iPhone doesn't

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
less shake whereas the iPhone doesn't
have<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> great<00:01:43.140> shake<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> section<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.979> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
have that great shake of a section on it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.910 
have that great shake of a section on it
so<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> try<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so that's why you know I want to try it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
so that's why you know I want to try it
on<00:01:46.950> both<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> different<00:01:48.420> tests

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
on both just see how the different tests

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
on both just see how the different tests
would<00:01:48.689> come<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.159> how<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> audio

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
would come out so this is how the audio

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
would come out so this is how the audio
sounds<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.380> now

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
sounds with the way I have it right now

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.429 
sounds with the way I have it right now
the<00:01:53.130> way<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.750> plants

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the way I have it right now the plants

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
the way I have it right now the plants
are<00:01:55.619> actually<00:01:55.770> covering<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> speakers<00:01:56.820> so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
are actually covering up the speakers so

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670 
are actually covering up the speakers so
it's<00:01:57.329> probably<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> audio<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.530> too

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's probably why the audio is not too

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.380 
it's probably why the audio is not too
good<00:01:58.890> right<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.100> I've<00:01:59.820> got<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> figure<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
good right now I've got to figure out a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
good right now I've got to figure out a
workaround

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
workaround

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.770 
workaround
maybe<00:02:01.170> maybe<00:02:01.560> fassbender<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> other<00:02:02.430> way

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
maybe maybe fassbender on the other way

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
maybe maybe fassbender on the other way
the<00:02:04.290> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> works<00:02:04.740> sort<00:02:05.190> of<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.550> but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the kind of works sort of kind of but

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
the kind of works sort of kind of but
then<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.790> run<00:02:05.910> into<00:02:06.060> other<00:02:06.150> issues<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.870> I'm<00:02:07.170> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
then I run into other issues so I'm so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.260 
then I run into other issues so I'm so
ticking<00:02:07.710> around<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> saying<00:02:08.520> what's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
ticking around with it saying what's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210 
ticking around with it saying what's
gonna<00:02:09.360> work<00:02:09.540> out<00:02:09.720> what's<00:02:09.990> not<00:02:10.170> maybe<00:02:11.010> there's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
gonna work out what's not maybe there's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.500 
gonna work out what's not maybe there's
a<00:02:11.280> reason<00:02:11.460> why<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:11.850> haven't<00:02:12.210> seen<00:02:12.360> many

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
a reason why I haven't seen many

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.150 
a reason why I haven't seen many
drivetest<00:02:13.050> videos<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.500> YouTube<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.860> don't<00:02:14.010> know

raw footage and in the event that I do
decide<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> stabilize<00:02:35.820> anything<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.420> editing

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
decide to stabilize anything and editing

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
decide to stabilize anything and editing
I<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:37.320> have<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> clearly<00:02:38.010> marked<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.460> the

I will have a clearly marked in the

side-by-side<00:02:40.770> obviously<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> camera<00:02:41.970> has

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
side-by-side obviously the camera has

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.120 
side-by-side obviously the camera has
built-in<00:02:42.810> image<00:02:42.990> stabilization<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
built-in image stabilization is going to

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530 
built-in image stabilization is going to
perform<00:02:44.520> better<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.270> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.450> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
perform better that's just kind of a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.110 
perform better that's just kind of a
given<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.890> want<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.370> how<00:02:47.520> much<00:02:47.850> better

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
given but I want to see how much better

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.300 
given but I want to see how much better
it<00:02:48.360> would<00:02:48.480> perform<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:49.170> iPhone<00:02:49.560> 5s<00:02:49.890> does

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
it would perform that my iPhone 5s does

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240 
it would perform that my iPhone 5s does
in<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.030> video<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.480> only<00:02:51.780> use<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.740> 1080p

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
in this video I only use the 1080p

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.280 
in this video I only use the 1080p
camera<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> iPhone<00:02:54.030> 5s<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.840> did<00:02:54.990> not<00:02:55.080> bother

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
camera on the iPhone 5s I did not bother

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
camera on the iPhone 5s I did not bother
with<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> 720p<00:02:56.100> camera<00:02:56.400> because<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.820> tried<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
with the 720p camera because I tried it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030 
with the 720p camera because I tried it
before<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:57.900> noticeable<00:02:58.350> shake<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.740> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
before and it had noticeable shake on it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.700 
before and it had noticeable shake on it
but<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.700> anything<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.780> attend<00:03:00.960> ATP<00:03:01.260> camera<00:03:01.650> is

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
but if anything the attend ATP camera is

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.020 
but if anything the attend ATP camera is
going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> better<00:03:02.700> image

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
going to have a better image

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.940 
going to have a better image
stabilization<00:03:03.360> built<00:03:03.840> into<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.440> that's

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
stabilization built into it so that's

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.050 
stabilization built into it so that's
why<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.100> just<00:03:05.130> went<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.820> even

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
why I just went with that one even

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.830 
why I just went with that one even
though<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> don't<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.570> they're<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.810> much

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
though I don't think they're that much

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690 
though I don't think they're that much
different<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.190> said<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:08.430> what<00:03:08.580> I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
different so like I said that's what I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.400 
different so like I said that's what I
use<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.090> one<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:09.930> compare<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
use that one and then compare with the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
use that one and then compare with the
Canon<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> actual<00:03:11.610> difference

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
Canon to see what the actual difference

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.430 
Canon to see what the actual difference
would<00:03:12.209> be<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:12.930> make<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.050> judgement

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
would be and you can make a judgement

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.930 
would be and you can make a judgement
for<00:03:13.530> yourself<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.340> these<00:03:14.459> shots<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
for yourself to get these shots I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.400 
for yourself to get these shots I
attached<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.480> car<00:03:15.660> mount<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.989> both<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
attached the car mount to both the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.370 
attached the car mount to both the
windshield<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.150> dashboard<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.959> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
windshield and to the dashboard just to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.330 
windshield and to the dashboard just to
see<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.590> there<00:03:19.680> would<00:03:19.800> be<00:03:19.830> any<00:03:19.980> difference

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
see if there would be any difference

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
see if there would be any difference
because<00:03:20.520> when<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.850> first<00:03:21.060> attached<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.840> did

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
because when I first attached it I did

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.260 
because when I first attached it I did
it<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.590> car<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.250> dead<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> dashboard

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
it to the car I dead it to the dashboard

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.510 
it to the car I dead it to the dashboard
of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> car<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.989> then<00:03:25.680> later<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.100> did<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
of the car and then later on I did it to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.570 
of the car and then later on I did it to
the<00:03:26.880> windshield<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.720> from<00:03:27.989> my<00:03:28.430> results<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the windshield and from my results I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.920 
the windshield and from my results I
think<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.120> windshield<00:03:30.540> gets<00:03:30.690> slightly

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
think the windshield gets slightly

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.420 
think the windshield gets slightly
better<00:03:31.050> results<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.830> could<00:03:32.100> be<00:03:32.220> wrong<00:03:32.370> maybe

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
better results I could be wrong maybe

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.610 
better results I could be wrong maybe
that's<00:03:32.820> just<00:03:32.940> me<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.870> seems<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.470> in

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that's just me but that seems to be in

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.410 
that's just me but that seems to be in
my<00:03:34.709> general<00:03:35.040> results<00:03:35.519> now<00:03:35.880> let's<00:03:36.060> take<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> look

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
my general results now let's take a look

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.820 
my general results now let's take a look
at<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.810> features<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.440> car<00:03:37.650> mount

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
at some of the features of the car mount

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.590 
at some of the features of the car mount
itself<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:38.880> here<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.269> can<00:03:39.360> see<00:03:39.420> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
itself so right here we can see the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.590 
itself so right here we can see the
sticky<00:03:39.930> stuff<00:03:40.140> which<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.500> very<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:42.090> it's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
sticky stuff which is very and it's

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.970 
sticky stuff which is very and it's
incredibly<00:03:42.989> strong<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:43.590> basically<00:03:43.830> like

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
incredibly strong it's basically like

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.620 
incredibly strong it's basically like
Superman<00:03:44.400> gripping<00:03:44.730> your<00:03:44.880> dashboard<00:03:45.390> or<00:03:45.510> your

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
Superman gripping your dashboard or your

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.949 
Superman gripping your dashboard or your
window<00:03:45.989> or<00:03:46.170> wherever<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:47.750> then<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.840> have

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
window or wherever and then you have

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:49.940 
window or wherever and then you have
this<00:03:49.050> little<00:03:49.260> notch<00:03:49.410> right<00:03:49.560> here<00:03:49.620> which

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
this little notch right here which

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
this little notch right here which
controls<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.790> bintang<00:03:51.180> flexibility<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.930> this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
controls the bintang flexibility of this

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.449 
controls the bintang flexibility of this
point<00:03:52.530> right<00:03:52.620> here<00:03:52.680> I'm<00:03:52.980> gonna<00:03:53.100> see<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.340> can

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
point right here I'm gonna see if I can

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.370 
point right here I'm gonna see if I can
actually<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.790> one-handed<00:03:54.300> unscrew<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
actually just one-handed unscrew this a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.560 
actually just one-handed unscrew this a
little<00:03:55.530> bit<00:03:55.739> then<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.330> creates<00:03:57.330> have<00:03:57.420> been

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
little bit then it creates have been

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.449 
little bit then it creates have been
playing<00:03:58.110> right<00:03:58.230> there<00:03:58.260> I'm<00:03:58.560> kind<00:03:58.800> of<00:03:58.890> it's

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
playing right there I'm kind of it's

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.920 
playing right there I'm kind of it's
written<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.940> tighten<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.269> back<00:04:00.330> up<00:04:00.390> because<00:04:00.810> if

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
written I tighten it back up because if

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
written I tighten it back up because if
I<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.080> then<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:01.500> gonna<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:02.190> getting<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.550> my

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I don't then it's gonna be getting on my

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.610 
I don't then it's gonna be getting on my
nerves<00:04:02.880> then<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> second<00:04:04.200> bin<00:04:04.320> point

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
nerves then you have a second bin point

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.930 
nerves then you have a second bin point
right<00:04:04.890> here<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.120> twist<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.140> way

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
right here so if I twist this this way

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.060 
right here so if I twist this this way
then<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.260> maneuver<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.500> piece<00:04:10.890> right

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
then you can maneuver this piece right

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.510 
then you can maneuver this piece right
here<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.670> various<00:04:12.150> ways<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.069> then<00:04:14.069> basically

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
here in various ways and then basically

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.950 
here in various ways and then basically
what<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.760> do<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.270> your<00:04:15.330> phone<00:04:15.630> or

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
what you do is you get your phone or

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.390 
what you do is you get your phone or
whatever<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:17.010> press

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
whatever it is you press

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.530 
whatever it is you press
again<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:17.910> press<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.269> against<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.540> dot<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
again you press it against the dot and

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.600 
again you press it against the dot and
what's<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.870> horrible<00:04:22.470> example<00:04:22.860> try<00:04:23.550> it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
what's that horrible example try it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.670 
what's that horrible example try it
again<00:04:23.810> that's<00:04:24.810> exactly<00:04:25.199> what<00:04:25.350> happened<00:04:25.620> right

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
again that's exactly what happened right

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.610 
again that's exactly what happened right
there<00:04:25.770> now<00:04:26.690> this<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:27.990> big<00:04:28.199> enough<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.470> fit

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
there now this is not big enough to fit

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.990 
there now this is not big enough to fit
my<00:04:28.650> actual<00:04:29.190> GPS

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
my actual GPS

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.999 
my actual GPS
it's<00:04:30.360> bigger<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.660> fit<00:04:30.780> my<00:04:30.900> phone<00:04:31.169> it's<00:04:31.860> being

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
it's bigger to fit my phone it's being

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.140 
it's bigger to fit my phone it's being
able<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.190> fit<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.490> camera<00:04:32.729> that<00:04:32.789> I've<00:04:32.910> coming

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
able to fit the camera that I've coming

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150 
able to fit the camera that I've coming
this<00:04:33.240> on<00:04:33.360> right<00:04:33.509> now<00:04:33.720> although<00:04:34.080> these<00:04:34.919> pieces

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
this on right now although these pieces

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.219 
this on right now although these pieces
right<00:04:35.400> here<00:04:35.460> do<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.850> cover<00:04:36.090> up<00:04:36.270> my<00:04:36.300> mics<00:04:36.660> so

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
right here do to cover up my mics so

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.680 
right here do to cover up my mics so
sometimes<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.070> tried<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.729> spin<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.509> around

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
sometimes I tried to spin up and around

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.779 
sometimes I tried to spin up and around
do<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.050> way<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.949> just<00:04:41.009> just<00:04:41.520> typically

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
do it this way it just just typically

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.999 
do it this way it just just typically
frees<00:04:42.030> up<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.270> mics<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.710> right<00:04:43.830> here<00:04:43.889> is

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
frees up the mics but this right here is

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.860 
frees up the mics but this right here is
pressing<00:04:44.370> down<00:04:44.520> on<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.759> picture<00:04:45.360> button<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:45.810> I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
pressing down on the picture button so I

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.029 
pressing down on the picture button so I
have<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.020> make<00:04:46.139> sure<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.410> every<00:04:46.800> chord

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
have to make sure that every chord

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.590 
have to make sure that every chord
before<00:04:47.280> played<00:04:47.490> on<00:04:47.580> here<00:04:47.820> I'm<00:04:48.330> still

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
before played on here I'm still

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.029 
before played on here I'm still
experimenting<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.199> that<00:04:49.380> have<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.650> done<00:04:49.770> too

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
experimenting with that have it done too

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.370 
experimenting with that have it done too
many<00:04:50.130> tests<00:04:50.370> with<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.639> but<00:04:51.380> that's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
many tests with that but that's

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.900 
many tests with that but that's
basically<00:04:52.560> how<00:04:52.949> this<00:04:53.070> thing<00:04:53.250> operates<00:04:53.430> over

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
basically how this thing operates over

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.080 
basically how this thing operates over
also<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.370> show<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.610> how<00:04:56.910> difficult

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
also and just to show you how difficult

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.820 
also and just to show you how difficult
this<00:04:57.330> thing<00:04:57.510> as<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:57.630> pull<00:04:57.840> up<00:04:57.870> some<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.710> may

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
this thing as I pull up some of you may

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.560 
this thing as I pull up some of you may
have<00:04:58.889> are<00:04:59.039> seen<00:04:59.220> other<00:04:59.340> videos<00:04:59.400> but<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.180> a

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
have are seen other videos but as a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.390 
have are seen other videos but as a
latch<00:05:00.930> back<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.650> bag<00:05:01.860> which<00:05:02.070> I'm<00:05:02.220> probably

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
latch back in the bag which I'm probably

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.310 
latch back in the bag which I'm probably
at<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.870> spin-around

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
at the spin-around

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.510 
at the spin-around
has<00:05:04.590> latched<00:05:04.919> back<00:05:05.190> here<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:06.270> pull<00:05:06.449> this<00:05:06.539> up

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
has latched back here you pull this up

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.120 
has latched back here you pull this up
sue<00:05:08.520> fan<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.840> as<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.169> can<00:05:10.289> see<00:05:10.349> already<00:05:10.919> how

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
sue fan and as you can see already how

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.890 
sue fan and as you can see already how
much<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.370> difference<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.639> makes<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.270> then

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
much of a difference that makes and then

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.930 
much of a difference that makes and then
I'm<00:05:13.889> not<00:05:13.949> sure<00:05:14.070> if<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.370> build<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.789> one

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
I'm not sure if I can build just one

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.050 
I'm not sure if I can build just one
hand<00:05:15.090> or<00:05:15.270> not<00:05:15.360> but<00:05:15.509> I<00:05:15.539> try<00:05:16.310> then<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.430> have<00:05:17.580> to

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.490 

this<00:05:21.830> goes<00:05:22.830> so<00:05:23.789> that's<00:05:24.000> how<00:05:24.150> much<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.690> a<00:05:25.320> grip

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
this goes so that's how much of a grip

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.790 
this goes so that's how much of a grip
this<00:05:25.680> thing<00:05:25.860> has<00:05:26.660> super<00:05:27.660> suction<00:05:28.020> cup<00:05:28.380> man

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
this thing has super suction cup man

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.350 
this thing has super suction cup man
it's<00:05:28.949> blurry<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.490> don't<00:05:29.970> know<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.120> it'll<00:05:30.210> focus

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
it's blurry I don't know if it'll focus

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.860 
it's blurry I don't know if it'll focus
or<00:05:30.599> not<00:05:30.630> but<00:05:30.990> yeah<00:05:31.320> super<00:05:31.680> suction<00:05:31.889> cup<00:05:32.870> is

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
or not but yeah super suction cup is

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.159 
or not but yeah super suction cup is
super<00:05:34.349> suction<00:05:34.560> cup<00:05:35.180> made<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.330> Korea<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.990> I

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
super suction cup made in Korea and I

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.330 
super suction cup made in Korea and I
think<00:05:37.409> that<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:37.620> thing<00:05:37.800> is<00:05:37.889> so<00:05:38.039> strong<00:05:38.310> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
think that this thing is so strong that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.040 
think that this thing is so strong that
they've<00:05:38.669> actually<00:05:38.820> put<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.120> patent<00:05:39.599> on<00:05:39.720> this

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
they've actually put a patent on this

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.740 
they've actually put a patent on this
thing<00:05:40.320> on<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.919> one<00:05:40.979> specifically<00:05:41.699> so<00:05:42.060> it's

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
thing on this one specifically so it's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.740 
thing on this one specifically so it's
very<00:05:42.870> strong<00:05:43.460> that<00:05:44.460> seems<00:05:44.699> together<00:05:44.820> there's

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
very strong that seems together there's

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.020 
very strong that seems together there's
essentially<00:05:46.020> how<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.260> thing<00:05:46.440> works<00:05:46.620> so<00:05:47.220> your

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
essentially how the thing works so your

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.580 
essentially how the thing works so your
think<00:05:48.150> about<00:05:48.300> getting<00:05:48.510> one<00:05:48.539> this<00:05:49.349> video

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
think about getting one this video

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.469 
think about getting one this video
should<00:05:49.860> give<00:05:50.099> you<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.639> pretty<00:05:50.940> good<00:05:51.060> overall

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
should give you a pretty good overall

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.149 
should give you a pretty good overall
idea<00:05:51.930> if<00:05:52.260> it's<00:05:52.470> right<00:05:52.650> for<00:05:52.680> you

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
idea if it's right for you

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.589 
idea if it's right for you
also<00:05:53.669> one<00:05:53.849> last<00:05:53.880> thing<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.180> I'd<00:05:54.449> like<00:05:54.570> to

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
also one last thing that I'd like to

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:55.879 
also one last thing that I'd like to
mention<00:05:54.840> is<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.289> piece<00:05:55.440> right<00:05:55.620> here<00:05:55.680> as

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
mention is that this piece right here as

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.680 
mention is that this piece right here as
it<00:05:56.039> slides<00:05:56.250> all<00:05:56.580> this<00:05:57.060> is<00:05:57.180> essentially<00:05:57.479> others

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
it slides all this is essentially others

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.750 
it slides all this is essentially others
works<00:05:57.900> this<00:05:58.860> piece<00:05:59.010> this<00:05:59.310> piece<00:05:59.400> right<00:05:59.699> here

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
works this piece this piece right here

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.430 
works this piece this piece right here
you<00:06:00.449> have<00:06:00.479> to<00:06:00.659> grab<00:06:00.810> list<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.080> have<00:06:01.199> to<00:06:01.229> grip

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
you have to grab list you have to grip

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.260 
you have to grab list you have to grip
this<00:06:01.530> middle<00:06:01.800> part<00:06:01.889> right<00:06:02.039> here<00:06:02.340> anything<00:06:03.120> you

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
this middle part right here anything you

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.450 
this middle part right here anything you
have<00:06:03.419> to<00:06:03.479> push<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.870> down<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:07.010> that<00:06:08.010> clicks

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
have to push it down on this that clicks

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.820 
have to push it down on this that clicks
and<00:06:08.789> then<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.330> just<00:06:09.449> pull<00:06:09.690> off<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.500> as<00:06:10.800> you

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
and then you just pull off and as you

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.930 
and then you just pull off and as you
can<00:06:10.979> see<00:06:11.070> this<00:06:11.190> piece<00:06:11.310> right<00:06:11.460> here<00:06:11.520> has<00:06:11.820> these

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
can see this piece right here has these

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.800 
can see this piece right here has these
notches<00:06:12.240> in<00:06:12.510> it

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
notches in it

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.270 
notches in it
that<00:06:13.110> match<00:06:13.349> it<00:06:13.500> up<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.620> these<00:06:13.830> notches<00:06:14.010> right

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
that match it up to these notches right

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.100 
that match it up to these notches right
here<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.849> it's<00:06:15.120> just<00:06:15.180> a<00:06:15.330> matter<00:06:15.360> clipping<00:06:15.900> them
