and after g6 f6 I would like to meet him
on<00:02:59.370> g7<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.270> believe<00:03:00.570> their<00:03:00.810> works<00:03:00.990> out<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
on g7 and I believe their works out and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.670 
on g7 and I believe their works out and
he<00:03:01.860> believes<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.430> too<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.940> he<00:03:03.480> plays<00:03:03.720> Queen<00:03:04.050> h4

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
he believes so too and he plays Queen h4

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.280 
he believes so too and he plays Queen h4
but<00:03:04.950> now<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.400> another<00:03:05.580> idea<00:03:06.090> up<00:03:06.600> my<00:03:06.870> sleeve

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
but now I have another idea up my sleeve

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.290 
but now I have another idea up my sleeve
which<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.770> native<00:03:08.040> 6<00:03:08.430> check<00:03:09.860> followed<00:03:10.860> by<00:03:11.040> rook

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
which is native 6 check followed by rook

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.840 
which is native 6 check followed by rook
h3<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.630> looks<00:03:12.900> pretty<00:03:13.830> crushing<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:14.760> he

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
h3 and this looks pretty crushing so he

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.940 
h3 and this looks pretty crushing so he
has<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.150> give<00:03:15.300> up<00:03:15.330> his<00:03:15.630> screen<00:03:15.930> now<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.290> he

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
has to give up his screen now and he

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.310 
has to give up his screen now and he
does<00:03:17.300> but<00:03:18.300> he<00:03:18.510> had<00:03:18.600> some<00:03:18.780> kind<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.140> play

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
does but he had some kind of play

the<00:03:40.500> G<00:03:40.860> file<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.340> double<00:03:41.760> his<00:03:41.910> rope<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.390> that's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
the G file to double his rope so that's

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.900 
the G file to double his rope so that's
good<00:03:42.840> news<00:03:42.870> for<00:03:43.080> me<00:03:43.410> otherwise<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.760> might

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
good news for me otherwise he might

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.420 
good news for me otherwise he might
develop<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.650> dangerous<00:03:46.650> attack<00:03:46.980> against<00:03:47.280> my

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
develop a dangerous attack against my

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
develop a dangerous attack against my
king<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.270> probably<00:03:48.630> his<00:03:48.780> best<00:03:48.959> option<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.530> to

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
king so probably his best option is to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.920 
king so probably his best option is to
play<00:03:49.890> rook<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.370> tree<00:03:50.550> plays<00:03:50.850> Bishop<00:03:51.209> g2<00:03:51.630> it's

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
play rook to tree plays Bishop g2 it's

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.160 
play rook to tree plays Bishop g2 it's
interesting<00:03:53.330> probably<00:03:54.330> was<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.959> take

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
interesting probably was to want to take

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.410 
interesting probably was to want to take
on<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.560> tree<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.130> give<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:56.580> queen<00:03:56.850> back<00:03:57.000> anyway<00:03:57.360> so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
on a tree I give my queen back anyway so

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.170 
on a tree I give my queen back anyway so
doesn't<00:03:58.410> make<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.560> difference<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.489> now

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
doesn't make a difference really and now

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.660 
doesn't make a difference really and now
with<00:04:00.540> what<00:04:01.170> kind<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.739> rook<00:04:01.950> endgame<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.520> we

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
with what kind of rook endgame do we

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.490 
with what kind of rook endgame do we

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.890 
you can see three minutes is not a lot
of<00:06:27.820> time<00:06:28.180> to<00:06:28.450> play<00:06:28.660> but<00:06:29.500> I<00:06:29.740> managed<00:06:30.130> to<00:06:30.160> beat

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
of time to play but I managed to beat

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.600 
of time to play but I managed to beat
unconscious<00:06:31.900> and<00:06:32.260> consensual<00:06:33.220> so<00:06:33.940> maybe<00:06:34.330> the

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
unconscious and consensual so maybe the

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.010 
unconscious and consensual so maybe the
winning<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:36.729> queen<00:06:37.150> with<00:06:37.450> night<00:06:37.690> of<00:06:37.870> six<00:06:38.200> and

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
winning a queen with night of six and

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.439 
winning a queen with night of six and
rook<00:06:39.379> h3<00:06:39.889> was<00:06:40.039> a<00:06:40.069> little<00:06:40.340> bit<00:06:40.460> pre-major<00:06:41.030> maybe

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
rook h3 was a little bit pre-major maybe

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.600 
rook h3 was a little bit pre-major maybe
at<00:06:41.599> something<00:06:42.229> better<00:06:42.500> up<00:06:42.770> my<00:06:42.949> sleeve<00:06:43.220> I'm<00:06:43.430> not

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
at something better up my sleeve I'm not

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.999 
at something better up my sleeve I'm not
sure<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:43.879> didn't<00:06:44.180> see<00:06:44.360> anything<00:06:44.599> and<00:06:44.960> then<00:06:45.889> he

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
sure I didn't see anything and then he

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.830 
sure I didn't see anything and then he
had<00:06:46.129> some<00:06:46.310> counter<00:06:46.729> play<00:06:46.940> along<00:06:47.270> the<00:06:47.389> gphone<00:06:47.780> i

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
had some counter play along the gphone i

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.659 
had some counter play along the gphone i
believe<00:06:48.470> the<00:06:48.740> rook<00:06:48.919> endgame<00:06:49.250> might<00:06:49.490> be

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
believe the rook endgame might be

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.920 
believe the rook endgame might be
actually<00:06:49.819> equal<00:06:50.210> but<00:06:50.629> it<00:06:51.319> should<00:06:51.860> be<00:06:52.930> harder

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
actually equal but it should be harder

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.480 
actually equal but it should be harder
to<00:06:53.960> play<00:06:54.289> for<00:06:54.349> blogging<00:06:54.710> you<00:06:54.860> could<00:06:55.099> see<00:06:55.370> this

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.339 
an inboard you could see his in the game
because<00:06:57.639> black<00:06:58.639> had<00:06:59.030> his<00:06:59.210> King<00:06:59.569> stack<00:07:00.080> on<00:07:00.319> the

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349

because black had his King stack on the
eighth-ranked<00:07:01.039> so<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.669> then<00:07:02.629> I<00:07:02.659> just

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900
