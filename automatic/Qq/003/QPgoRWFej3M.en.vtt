00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 something like that goes back to welcome 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.700
 another pokemon external analysis 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 yes there are some news to the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.970
 Both play and I will 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.320
 Immediately show off here 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.639
 that does somehow even now 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 no sense because I want to be already 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 out for a month and still gives 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 It's news to those who like to play 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.010
 should do that because I have none 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 idea 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 In any case, three new pokémon 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.000
 revealed and form two more mega 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 of two older pokémon than I will 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 Instant but but I have to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 say that this information is not 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 officially of nintendo are but of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.980
 any sources 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 I do not know where that's not yet 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 officially confirmed so you can still 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 do not assume that it is correct 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 But I think the pictures are in the game 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 programmed so should already 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.320
 to be correct someday kita or 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.690
 a hacker is just in the poker extra 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 a failed has hacked and has 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.020
 then the data taken so 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.250
 definitely have a shit right now 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.840
 the three pokémon and I will 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.829
 Feel the same just catch 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.859
 with the first one 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.609
 This is called the anti or the dress 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.590
 no idea 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.290
 it is rumored that there is another 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.290
 Form continues to shape the development of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.000
 roca is traveling because roca looks shaved 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.040
 also about as crystal immediately 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 moderate and I think they are similar too 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 somehow very blatantly bad German 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.299
 I can talk to me what is going on 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.740
 I definitely yes it looks okay 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.439
 I'm not necessarily good right now 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 Looks okay , you can leave it that way 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.009
 but why is that extra? 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 pokemon why is that only now where 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.840
 we reveal that now, not the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.450
 Gameplay itself I mean something like 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 can you get this pokémon 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.140
 I mean that does not make sense to me 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 my if you later this 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.470
 you can definitely publish his 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.299
 develop local into this pokemon 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.680
 but why did you take your time ? 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.659
 to let go here 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.540
 i mean the few that the pokemon as well 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.369
 with genes says and the other way is yes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 still ok but this looks very banal 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.960
 not legendary so why this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.590
 Wait so why should I on something like that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.469
 waiting 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.259
 I do not understand it for 2 the second 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.520
 means vulkan ion and looks very cool 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.520
 Geschwindner is the hottest of the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.679
 three pokémon and I think 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 it has a legendary pokémon potential 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.180
 to be and I think it is a lot 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.700
 pokémon it is of the type water fire and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.650
 that means it is a brand new type of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.660
 never a type combination 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.819
 not yet yet 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.769
 has given and I find horny on everyone 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.910
 something cool and looks okay 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.720
 So I find it cool it really looks 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.750
 good as put and the last one is called 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.340
 hooper and sudokus so very small and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.640
 inferior i know i dont know 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.840
 why so normal pokémon now only 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.660
 I do not understand it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 I 'll be sick immediately 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.260
 pokemon so from 3,6 kilograms jörg polzer 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.079
 moderately then I would be very happy 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.459
 because then we immediately what are you going to do 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.720
 but that willi sees it all 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.040
 banal pokemon now in the game 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.750
 win the program can 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.660
 I mean, why are they first 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.049
 now before that kneels before you what 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.040
 going 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.440
 no idea it was also bad 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.030
 there is another picture of new 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.319
 I think that was also shown 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.579
 played and I think you can 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.260
 do not get a game 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.940
 definitely not in the regular way 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 and wise, and I think so 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.620
 just someone took the time 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.120
 to develop a chip where a where he 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.109
 turns up in form grass or something like that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.329
 there is something else to show proudly 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.250
 yes, the second wants to do the two 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.660
 new mega formulas than I can today 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.170
 not at all against the 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.090
 madness every case there are two new ones 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.730
 mega shapes of two older pokémon 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.319
 namely of matthias and latinos the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.319
 can you see here in the picture nowhere 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.799
 it now does not necessarily see a 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.200
 difference between the two pokémon 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.940
 this color also from the color 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.940
 her extremely equal out not so 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.079
 definitely different and I hope that we 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.730
 still changed because they look cheap 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.200
 the megaphone me yes ok but you see 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.250
 not really look different from them 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.299
 Just shit out of the air show 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.099
 In any case that's still changed 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.510
 that will give you a better color 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.600
 get clapped or something 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.009
 So I expect things again 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.490
 you should not do that from pokémon 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:24.710
 then soon game freak and 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.670
 you do not expect at all because the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.250
 Probably that one disappoints 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.750
 is always very big, even extreme 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.490
 big one should therefore his 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.430
 Expectations limit so that one 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.770
 simply does not come into the danger the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.340
 danger zone where you can be injured 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.550
 by a bad game or so well 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.930
 in any case, today you could want from me 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.280
 that were the news there is still 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.400
 there will be another picture here 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.180
 some new pokemon are still showing that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.940
 So you will see that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.070
 not logical of asos and others 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.930
 pokémon who were shown possibly 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.030
 are new or come a new form 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.460
 and yes he has in this generation 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.590
 a new form namely the many form 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.640
 does not look different looks quite banal 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.530
 from as in the rose bowl cheap so me 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.870
 you find yourself for a mega form 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.790
 should think out because assange is the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.220
 god the pokemon he is the creator 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.320
 Damn why the guy does not get 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.520
 megaphone as god so I'm only on 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.590
 Most deserve less form 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.320
 just because the baku is like that 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.700
 you just do not need it 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.880
 a lot of fantasy around the disturbing pokémon 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.780
 just imagine a god a thing 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:40.100
 sciences as god immediately golden both 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:43.850
 no idea of ​​the ghost imperial 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.530
 drama or such a sick being that 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.180
 full blatant looks divine or something 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.800
 no idea 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.260
 no, these are all my fantasies 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.550
 but they are very good 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.530
 it could become a very good creator 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.870
 So a very good pokémon city ​​thinks 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.640
 You definitely could take yours 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.680
 to create new games but then it would be 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.200
 pokémon might be good and that would not be 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.490
 good for nintendo because the players can 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.920
 then sell yourself even better 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.810
 that was good for them though 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.860
 no matter i shit i realize i am 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.710
 just totally over in any case people 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.570
 That's it for the analysis I think 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.360
 possibly comes from new material from 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.160
 this people called game freak or 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.660
 nintendo if there is something new new 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.330
 You will get information from again 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.770
 informed me, and that is so 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.810
 We go long until we have no news 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.000
 to pokémon evening because yes that will be 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.770
 just go so long as every hope 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.020
 I think that there is more material too 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.730
 will indicate this game then the game 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.830
 in itself is full because there is not 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.960
 so much to escape to explore and to 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.750
 I hope that more afterwards 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.400
 will come to no idea as 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.080
 download or channel for one 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.660
 Continuation what I know in any case 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.070
 it would be very desirable so people that 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.840
 which of me I thank you for 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.070
 see for listening and if it is you 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.540
 I have a thumbs up 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.440
 say goodbye to the next place or 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.440
 until the next analysis
