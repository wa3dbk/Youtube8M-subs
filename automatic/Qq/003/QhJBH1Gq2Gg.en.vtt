00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
engine which you know why I like sort of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.229 
engine which you know why I like sort of
build<00:00:51.340> them<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:51.580> we<00:00:51.640> can<00:00:51.730> give<00:00:51.850> him<00:00:51.879> a<00:00:51.970> bit<00:00:52.090> of<00:00:52.150> a

riff<00:00:52.420> but<00:00:53.410> yeah<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.739> engine<00:00:53.830> as<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.309> know

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
riff but yeah the engine as you know

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.990 
riff but yeah the engine as you know
head<00:00:55.059> um<00:00:55.530> originally<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:57.460> had<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:57.670> factory

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
head um originally it had a factory

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.210 
head um originally it had a factory
block<00:00:58.180> in<00:00:58.330> it<00:00:58.420> just<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:58.660> no<00:00:58.809> one<00:00:58.989> oh<00:00:59.110> but<00:00:59.590> after

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
block in it just a no one oh but after

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.040 
block in it just a no one oh but after
doing<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.489> amount<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.000> work<00:01:01.120> with<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.360> I<00:01:01.750> would

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
doing a amount of work with that I would

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.979 
doing a amount of work with that I would
end<00:01:02.230> up<00:01:02.290> cracking<00:01:02.530> their<00:01:02.860> head<00:01:03.220> off<00:01:03.430> like<00:01:03.989> from

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
end up cracking their head off like from

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.660 
end up cracking their head off like from
the<00:01:05.080> head<00:01:05.230> bolt<00:01:05.440> into<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> ball<00:01:05.890> Wow<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.520> then

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
the head bolt into the ball Wow and then

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.370 
the head bolt into the ball Wow and then
we<00:01:07.000> ended<00:01:07.120> up<00:01:07.180> putting<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.690> SH<00:01:07.990> people

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
we ended up putting just a SH people

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.480 
we ended up putting just a SH people
like<00:01:08.470> which<00:01:08.590> are<00:01:08.710> only<00:01:08.800> rated<00:01:09.010> at<00:01:09.250> 600

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
like which are only rated at 600

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.670 
like which are only rated at 600
horsepower<00:01:09.909> but<00:01:10.570> whatever<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.260> proven<00:01:11.560> with

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
horsepower but whatever is proven with

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.830 
horsepower but whatever is proven with
this<00:01:11.800> thing<00:01:12.010> it's<00:01:12.970> always<00:01:13.210> been<00:01:13.390> making<00:01:13.540> sort

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
this thing it's always been making sort

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.380 
this thing it's always been making sort

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
we put a sixteenth rotting at this time

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.260 
we put a sixteenth rotting at this time
instead<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.390> 5.7<00:01:38.140> because<00:01:39.030> originally<00:01:40.030> it

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
instead of a 5.7 because originally it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.719 
instead of a 5.7 because originally it
was<00:01:40.750> always<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.990> 5.7<00:01:41.590> engine<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.189> put<00:01:42.399> maybe

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
was always a 5.7 engine and we put maybe

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.279 
was always a 5.7 engine and we put maybe
Pistons<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.479> but<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:43.659> never<00:01:43.810> change<00:01:44.079> Road

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
Pistons in it but we never change Road

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.170 
Pistons in it but we never change Road
so<00:01:44.469> now<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.680> did<00:01:44.979> rods<00:01:45.189> and<00:01:45.340> pistons<00:01:45.579> yeah<00:01:46.000> cuz

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
so now we did rods and pistons yeah cuz

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.139 
so now we did rods and pistons yeah cuz
um<00:01:46.390> yeah<00:01:47.020> three<00:01:47.289> years<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.560> Thresh<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:47.859> so<00:01:48.189> if

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
um yeah three years a Thresh and so if

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.849 
um yeah three years a Thresh and so if
I'm<00:01:49.299> gonna<00:01:49.479> do<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:50.109> time<00:01:50.320> ever<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.799> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
cool so flat tire can it is here just a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.300 
cool so flat tire can it is here just a
