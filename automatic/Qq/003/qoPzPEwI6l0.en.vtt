 so we need bricks 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 a pickaxe a pickaxe if you misplaced the odds such a but like 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.180
 no hole to dig does not matter if you do it by hand 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.390

 you do not ask yourself sports 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 to you make bricks from two authors like messi 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.840
 then we have to bring back 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.550
 one forward in the blood for the honey space blood and you do the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.550
 stairs 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 then dug 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 and you put the nave and oracle 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 you know the year will see after 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
 and you put a hatch at the bottom 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.050

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.170

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.539
 here are decorative and finally I think it's healthy, you can 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:35.820
 put into words 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.670
 next to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.890
 picnic tables or campsites think it's going well together 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.780
 these complementary so if you do if you have a flat space in your 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.869
 sparkling wine you do not know what to do you can do that if you 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.220

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 in no case its leather valley it will not go burn them either 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.160
 because there is a hatch that keeps the flames from reaching the speed of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.100
 at home by the way if you throw in it burns in fact that have never 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.889
