00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
 Hi, friends, I'm such a black fetus 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 records lately I've been going up 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 videos of this game that to date 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.259
 today still many people are still 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
 uploading your mysteries to youtube 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.950
 many are repeated and others are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 modifications equal clarified that there 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
 other unimportant mysteries but their 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.759
 intention is to entertain thanks to all 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 the loqueros and video bloggers that have 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.230
 uploaded all your videos about this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.780
 game is worth mentioning that this mystery or 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 rather a big mistake of the game I 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 A friend who is a programmer has passed it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.020
 and I look for something weird among the files of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.360
 game with no more to say set his 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 computer and he showed me the procedure 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 for that great fault to pass and here it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.530
 I'm going to show you let's start a game 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 new normal by the way there should not be 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 no modification of the game or kernel 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.539
 mods or user songs or games 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.539
 saved 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.850
 the game should start normal tells us 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 let's go to the icon that says cj 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.560
 we take the bicycle but not 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.200
 we will go to the icon we will be diverted by the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.119
 tunnel of the train lines I will not cut 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.119
 the video so they can see all the steps 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.340
 here we got off the bike and by only 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.030
 chance we'll just put a trick on the trick 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.799
 is zymymw 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 that trick is to have weapons that for 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.299
 true will serve us will not affect anything 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.079
 of the game will only give us the ease of 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 kill well jane 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.950
 now we are going to ride again in the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.760
 bicycle until you get where you are as 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760
 a red room 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.760
 and ready we have to take out the bazooka 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.770
 get in the middle of the door not very 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.770
 stuck like it is in the video 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.820
 we shoot until the character dies 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.800
 it will be needed twice the first time 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.870
 is where the door is and the second time 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.200
 even lower but it has to be in 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.200
 medium 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.100
 sorry the delay of the good video since 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.330
 we have killed our character now 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.330
 pay attention to what happens 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.060
 Now we are in the hospital for being 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.920
 first time the game will give you a few 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.520
 tips as the game gets stuck 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.220
 little while 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.959
 Look, if she's gone, you have to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.709
 wait for the advice to be removed 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.709
 to continue 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.520
 very well now we are in blueberry 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.500
 Check well there before it appears 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.500
 burberry appeared the word jefferson 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 there are small mistakes like the one in cars and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.739
 pedestrians disappear but good only is 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.739
 a graphics error 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.430
 certainly the weapons do not take them away 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.829
 you can still preserve that is another mistake 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.019
 well here we have to be with the 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.659
 clean hands bend over and take out the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.920
 bazooka shoot until kill like that and so 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.920
 as it appears in the video 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.120
 you have to aim in the middle remember the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.310
 video is somewhat slow because of 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.910
 france like my card is not very 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.910
 good to say 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.190
 once the fire is there we make 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.350
 go on and burn, even if they can 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.449
 shoot again once the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.370
 character is dead again we can 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.370
 see the great mystery and error of the game 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.040
 ready has died here see well what 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.230
 happens this is weird as they saw we did not go 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.070
 to the hospital but if we are in the background 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.260
 from the ocean 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.180
 our life bar is very small 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.440
 but it does not diminish it 's as if 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.440
 we were on earth 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.290
 we are ready to walk to the shore 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.650
 and let your character fall to 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.650
 background 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.400
 this took us to the restricted area 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.650
 the game turned into another color have 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.870
 spent hours and it only took a few seconds 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.430
 in going from the sea to the restricted area as 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.070
 we can see the doors of the area 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.680
 restricted are open as we can 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.720
 see that the police are not chasing us here 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.790
 this area is still open 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.590
 I hope we have to throw ourselves are 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.440
 ready because here goes the big mistake and 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.930
 mystery of the game they saw good there's something 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.270
 in that hole maybe it was a rock or a 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.700
 game graphic if they want to repeat of 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.130
 new the video because the game was damaged 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.320
 by the way the game came out and frax 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.390
 obviously stopped so from my 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.250
 cell phone I took a video to the screen 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.250
 since he froze and said error 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.790
 it sounds like that because in the end the 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.860
 game but you still hear the audio 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.020
 the character when falling is heard 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.240
 as if a car is crawling 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.000
 france did not manage to record neither the video and the 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.280
 audio once my computer 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.220
 Reacted to check the game files 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.650
 see this is all there is no more 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.450
 things are supposed to be others 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.020
 named files as vor vice 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.020
 Similar 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.100
 in fact all the files with the 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.260
 extension of ll have been deleted see 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.350
 This image takes a picture before recording 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.169
 the video you see there are the files are 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.510
 all those who at the end say of ll are 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.790
 5 files if you want to check that 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.980
 mystery keep those files in another 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.930
 folder and when finished they happen again 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.300
 that folder does not have to be installed 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.160
 again he is san andreas but if not 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.400
 they saved it they will have to install 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.760
 new thanks for watching the video a greeting 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.760
 Thank you
