00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 &lt;b&gt; K3 PRODUCTION &lt;/b&gt; 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Give girls 37k03.2 class on October 20 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 COLLECTION LAST (DA NANG VESION) 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Give so much love now fly away, &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 You have a couple of times to bring Van Anh over 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Once sweet, I received bitterness for Anh ……. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Thu plays a role in her hair 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 United on mi Dung leaves fallen small streets 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Gentle somewhere smells of milk flowers ... 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Listen around the sound of familiar stars 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 In so many ignorance, aimlessly aiming for yellow leaf season, 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 gentle and then fall no longer love Duyen 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It has been a long time since he defined two love languages 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 I can't give it to you ever since you have Hoanh 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 that fall he had Huong. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So why now 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 More than a year has passed Hang has been much different 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 He heard the falling leaves without Ly 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 that fall he was no longer Mai 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Could it be that I quickly forgot 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 and maybe Russia put the fall away 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 maybe no autumn is left 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 in the mind 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Could it be like letting go of you? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Could it be that Ngoc is not the person he loves the most? 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 probably 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 he had to tell Hien just a dream 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 I lost Nhung 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Autumn comes and goes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 as what Hoan ordered 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 white paper cannot fade 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 each sad color of Hao 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Oh my aimless song 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 perhaps he never wrote a gift 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Lightweight calendar steps through 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.300
 how sweet how much try light Calendar step by step 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.000
 how sweet how many tries 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Yes or no 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 steps in Phuong's heart need a large space 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 know when you can 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Meet Thanh again 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 It was then that he felt 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Milk petal scent 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 i love you so passionate 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 as an ever-theorem 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.300
 A person may have to learn more Love 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 A person may have to learn more things 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Thao is the last piece he lacks 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Many nights of tormenting myself, I don't understand 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 It is very much love to pass through 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 There is no reason to make Time and that person meet and then fall in love 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 The door of hope seemed red in the face 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 no longer warm kiss kiss Tram's shoulders tight 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 emotions suddenly dumbfounded 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Thuy came to visit him 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Last fall then passed quickly, followed by the wind quietly dissolved 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 in a rainy afternoon 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Le helpless legs he missed so much 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 why can't he stop his eyes from blurring (because of water) 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 hugged the cold shoulder at the end of autumn 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 give him more pity .... 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 For so many love flying 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 How much love forever 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 far away from the horizon .... 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Probably 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I forgot to forget it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 and maybe 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Van brought the fall 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 maybe no autumn is left 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 in Wang's mind 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 probably 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Tu let go of him 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Perhaps Snow is not the person he loves the most 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 probably 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 He had to tell himself that Vy was just a dream 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I lost Trinh 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Danang has the most beautiful ceremony at night 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 It is also the time to embrace and tighten the ice across Pham Van Dong beach 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 close your eyes and touch your pain without name 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 startled suddenly remembered he could not reach 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 just a dream too calm 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 complete a gentle bracelet 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 and then he wondered idly waiting for Truc to come 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 whether a tomorrow will see Yen on the way of life 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Everyone is not surprised after so many days of waiting 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The song taken with the studio will follow our class 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 like a new ear 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Perhaps I quickly forgot like a new ear 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Perhaps I forgot it quickly 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 and maybe I brought the fall 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.300
 maybe no autumn is left 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
 in my mind 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
 maybe you let me go away 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
 Could you not be the one I love the most 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 Could it be that he had to tell himself that it was just a dream 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 I lost you
