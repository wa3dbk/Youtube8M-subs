that's<00:00:18.510> kind<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.600> a<00:00:19.949> natural<00:00:20.949> thing<00:00:21.130> when<00:00:21.340> when

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
that's kind of a natural thing when when

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.620 
that's kind of a natural thing when when
you're<00:00:21.730> short<00:00:21.939> long<00:00:22.060> as<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.210> player<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.449> you

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
you're short long as a player and you

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.620 
you're short long as a player and you
start<00:00:22.840> losing<00:00:23.019> then<00:00:23.439> you<00:00:24.279> know<00:00:24.400> guys<00:00:25.269> like<00:00:25.329> I

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
start losing then you know guys like I

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.929 
start losing then you know guys like I
get<00:00:26.380> looked<00:00:26.560> at<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:26.919> that's<00:00:27.220> fine<00:00:27.460> but<00:00:27.699> I

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
get looked at and that's fine but I

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.249 
get looked at and that's fine but I
don't<00:00:28.419> think<00:00:28.509> he's<00:00:28.659> got<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.900> change<00:00:29.019> a<00:00:29.169> whole

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
don't think he's got to change a whole

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.310 
don't think he's got to change a whole
lot<00:00:29.320> I<00:00:29.650> think<00:00:30.009> he's<00:00:30.329> you<00:00:31.329> know<00:00:31.359> he's<00:00:31.659> one<00:00:32.079> shot

lot I think he's you know he's one shot

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.840 
lot I think he's you know he's one shot
away<00:00:32.439> from<00:00:32.770> being<00:00:33.130> back<00:00:33.340> where<00:00:33.550> he<00:00:33.579> wants<00:00:33.820> to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
away from being back where he wants to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.670 
away from being back where he wants to
be<00:00:33.940> he's<00:00:34.390> playing<00:00:34.690> good<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.079> just<00:00:35.320> got<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.620> go

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
in for me said tonight's game I mean I

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.700 
in for me said tonight's game I mean I
would<00:00:37.720> imagine<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.050> guys<00:00:38.230> have<00:00:38.380> to<00:00:38.470> start

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
would imagine you guys have to start

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.500 
would imagine you guys have to start
been<00:00:39.190> looking<00:00:39.400> for<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.120> first<00:00:40.330> goal

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
been looking for it the first goal

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.000 
been looking for it the first goal
you're<00:00:40.720> peppering<00:00:41.020> him<00:00:41.230> with<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.530> shots<00:00:41.770> and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
you're peppering him with the shots and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.520 
you're peppering him with the shots and
think<00:00:42.310> that<00:00:42.460> get<00:00:42.730> ahead<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:44.260> go<00:00:44.350> through

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
think that get ahead just go through

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.670 
think that get ahead just go through
know<00:00:44.680> what<00:00:44.800> happened<00:00:45.070> yesterday<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:47.110> you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
know what happened yesterday well you

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
know what watching watch the game and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.360 
know what watching watch the game and
sometimes<00:00:50.200> you<00:00:50.320> gotta<00:00:50.440> watch<00:00:50.590> again<00:00:50.860> but<00:00:51.100> from

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
sometimes you gotta watch again but from

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.760 
sometimes you gotta watch again but from
from<00:00:51.850> what<00:00:52.060> I<00:00:52.090> saw<00:00:52.330> tonight<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:52.960> don't<00:00:53.530> think<00:00:53.560> we

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
from what I saw tonight I don't think we

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.460 
from what I saw tonight I don't think we
ever<00:00:53.800> felt<00:00:54.220> like<00:00:54.370> we<00:00:54.610> were<00:00:54.960> getting<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:56.020> plate<00:00:56.290> I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
ever felt like we were getting a plate I

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.720 
ever felt like we were getting a plate I
mean<00:00:56.680> even<00:00:56.800> when<00:00:56.980> they<00:00:57.130> scored<00:00:57.400> their<00:00:57.520> goal

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
mean even when they scored their goal

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.400 
mean even when they scored their goal
say<00:00:58.030> they'd<00:00:58.480> make<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> good<00:00:58.930> play<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.290> be<00:00:59.380> a

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
say they'd make a good play and be a

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.620 
say they'd make a good play and be a
goal<00:00:59.680> being<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.130> back<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.310> our<00:01:00.520> net<00:01:00.700> but<00:01:00.910> they

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
goal being in back of our net but they

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.900 
goal being in back of our net but they
never<00:01:01.780> really<00:01:02.200> had<00:01:02.800> momentum<00:01:03.130> we<00:01:03.580> felt<00:01:03.820> like

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
never really had momentum we felt like

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.429 
never really had momentum we felt like
we<00:01:04.180> felt<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:05.049> were<00:01:05.110> able<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.350> get

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
we felt like we were able to get

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.440 
we felt like we were able to get
momentum<00:01:05.590> throughout<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.310> whole<00:01:06.430> game<00:01:06.460> they

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
momentum throughout the whole game they

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.840 
momentum throughout the whole game they
got<00:01:07.630> those<00:01:07.689> two<00:01:08.590> quick<00:01:09.130> goals<00:01:09.159> but<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.759> were

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
got those two quick goals but there were

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.399 
got those two quick goals but there were
two<00:01:10.030> shifts<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.479> was<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:10.930> mean<00:01:11.140> they<00:01:11.230> didn't

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
two shifts I was it I mean they didn't

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.190 
two shifts I was it I mean they didn't
put<00:01:11.500> anything<00:01:11.710> together<00:01:11.890> after<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
put anything together after that so you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.290 
put anything together after that so you
know<00:01:14.260> it's<00:01:14.440> its<00:01:15.130> mistakes<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.790> for<00:01:15.970> us<00:01:16.120> and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
know it's its mistakes and for us and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.899 
know it's its mistakes and for us and
maybe<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:17.470> other<00:01:17.590> games<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.370> make<00:01:18.760> those

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
maybe in other games we make those

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.399 
maybe in other games we make those
mistakes<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.360> they<00:01:19.480> don't<00:01:19.600> go<00:01:19.750> in<00:01:19.930> but<00:01:20.140> you

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
mistakes and they don't go in but you

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.140 
mistakes and they don't go in but you
know<00:01:20.500> when<00:01:20.680> it's<00:01:20.890> when<00:01:21.400> it's<00:01:21.430> like<00:01:21.730> this<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
know when it's when it's like this it

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.610 
know when it's when it's like this it
seems<00:01:22.300> like<00:01:22.510> every<00:01:22.750> mistake<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.200> make<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.409> in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
seems like every mistake you make is in

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.710 
seems like every mistake you make is in
the<00:01:23.710> back<00:01:23.860> your<00:01:24.070> net<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.460> we've<00:01:25.330> just<00:01:25.360> got<00:01:25.600> to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the back your net and we've just got to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.630 
the back your net and we've just got to
dig<00:01:25.840> yourself<00:01:25.930> over<00:01:26.380> there<00:01:26.530> Daniel<00:01:27.250> mentioned

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
dig yourself over there Daniel mentioned

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640 
dig yourself over there Daniel mentioned
yesterday<00:01:28.120> that<00:01:28.420> he<00:01:28.900> thought<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.170> fact<00:01:29.530> that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
yesterday that he thought the fact that

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.710 
yesterday that he thought the fact that
it's<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.490> weird<00:01:30.729> time<00:01:30.909> on<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.150> schedule<00:01:31.450> you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
it's a weird time on the schedule you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's a weird time on the schedule you
haven't<00:01:31.990> added<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.200> lot<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.350> chance<00:01:32.650> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
haven't added a lot of chance to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.670 
haven't added a lot of chance to
practice<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:34.210> might<00:01:34.479> might<00:01:34.930> be<00:01:35.140> one<00:01:35.590> of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
practice and that might might be one of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.530 
practice and that might might be one of
the<00:01:35.740> problems<00:01:36.220> do<00:01:36.549> you<00:01:36.610> believe<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.090> or<00:01:37.299> is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the problems do you believe that or is

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.570 
the problems do you believe that or is
this<00:01:37.659> more<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.200> still<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.890> execution<00:01:39.490> in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
this more just still the execution in

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.730 
this more just still the execution in
the<00:01:39.640> mistakes<00:01:40.030> um<00:01:40.390> maybe<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.350> part<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.620> it

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
the mistakes um maybe that's part of it

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.680 
the mistakes um maybe that's part of it
and<00:01:42.060> you're<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.270> through<00:01:43.420> things<00:01:43.540> like

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
and you're going through things like

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.630 
and you're going through things like
this<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.110> always<00:01:44.140> kind<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.560> look<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.770> see<00:01:45.490> what

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
this you always kind of look to see what

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.700 
this you always kind of look to see what
it<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.330> question<00:01:46.870> things<00:01:47.110> but

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
it is and in question things but

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.890 
it is and in question things but
when<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:49.310> we<00:01:49.700> aren't<00:01:49.940> executing<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.570> it's

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
when we we aren't executing so it's

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.570 
when we we aren't executing so it's
because<00:01:51.110> we're<00:01:51.500> not<00:01:51.530> pricing<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:52.159> much<00:01:52.369> or

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
because we're not pricing as much or

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.030 
because we're not pricing as much or
whatever<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> case<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:53.869> we've<00:01:54.799> got<00:01:54.950> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
whatever the case is but we've got to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.700 
whatever the case is but we've got to
deal<00:01:55.190> with<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.460> there's<00:01:55.760> there's<00:01:56.750> no<00:01:56.900> second

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
deal with it there's there's no second

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.500 
deal with it there's there's no second
