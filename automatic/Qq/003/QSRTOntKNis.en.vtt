00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
daily ladder yesterday so I thought I'd

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
games to make up for that as possible so

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.730 
games to make up for that as possible so
I<00:00:18.810> hope<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.960> guys<00:00:19.020> understand<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and so this is going to be a zerg vs

zerg<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.420> i've<00:00:25.109> decided<00:00:25.410> i'm<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> go

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
zerg and i've decided i'm going to go

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.349 
zerg and i've decided i'm going to go
ahead<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> try<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.849> old<00:00:26.970> ZBZ

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
ahead and try out my good old ZBZ

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
ahead and try out my good old ZBZ
strategy<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
strategy that it was kind of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
strategy that it was kind of
controversial<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.359> made<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.840> think<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.050> was

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
controversial I made this I think it was

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.130 
controversial I made this I think it was
daily<00:00:31.410> ladder<00:00:31.590> 11<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.390> described<00:00:33.989> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
daily ladder 11 where I described this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.549 
daily ladder 11 where I described this
strategy<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.920> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.340> seven<00:00:35.790> pool

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
strategy which was kind of a seven pool

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
strategy which was kind of a seven pool
where<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.010> seven<00:00:38.280> pool<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> then<00:00:38.670> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
where you go for seven pool and then you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
where you go for seven pool and then you
pull<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.210> drones<00:00:39.809> pull<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.379> your

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
pull all your drones pull all your

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
pull all your drones pull all your
zerglings<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> build<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.760> spotting<00:00:42.090> crawlers

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
zerglings and build to spotting crawlers

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
zerglings and build to spotting crawlers
in<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.600> opponent's<00:00:42.930> base<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.980> strategy

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
in your opponent's base it's a strategy

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.690 
in your opponent's base it's a strategy
that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.000> using<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.829> zerg<00:00:47.100> vs<00:00:47.370> zerg<00:00:47.489> if

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that I like using on in zerg vs zerg if

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.510 
that I like using on in zerg vs zerg if
you<00:00:47.820> spawn<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.600> close<00:00:48.930> map<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.280> a

cannot<00:02:54.880> surround<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.040> kill<00:02:57.040> off<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:57.250> spine

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
cannot surround and kill off your spine

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.300 
cannot surround and kill off your spine
crawlers<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> pretty<00:02:59.740> much<00:02:59.860> up

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
crawlers so this is pretty much up

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.310 
crawlers so this is pretty much up
you're<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.120> biggest<00:03:01.750> part<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.050> game<00:03:02.170> is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
you're the biggest part of the game is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.570 
you're the biggest part of the game is
micronian<00:03:02.830> units<00:03:03.070> making<00:03:03.250> sure<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.550> can

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
micronian units making sure you can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.400 
micronian units making sure you can
handle<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.720> course<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:05.080> opponent

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
handle this and of course my opponent

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.199 
handle this and of course my opponent
wisely<00:03:05.860> building<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.370> spine<00:03:06.580> crawler<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.060> his

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
wisely building a spine crawler of his

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.790 
wisely building a spine crawler of his
own<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> bit<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.530> problem

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
own so this is a bit of a problem

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.270 
own so this is a bit of a problem
obviously<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.930> his<00:03:11.530> spine<00:03:11.740> crawlers<00:03:12.100> up

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
obviously because his spine crawlers up

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
obviously because his spine crawlers up
whereas<00:03:12.580> mine<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.120> still<00:03:13.450> morphing<00:03:14.140> they're

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
whereas mine are still morphing they're

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.949 
whereas mine are still morphing they're
still<00:03:14.650> on<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.070> way<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:16.000> I'm<00:03:16.360> gonna<00:03:16.630> have<00:03:16.840> to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
still on the way so I'm gonna have to

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.360 
still on the way so I'm gonna have to
figure<00:03:17.200> out<00:03:17.350> a<00:03:17.410> way<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> chill<00:03:17.860> with<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.130> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
figure out a way to chill with this and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.520 
figure out a way to chill with this and
it's<00:03:18.760> going<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:18.940> come<00:03:19.209> down<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.750> very<00:03:20.050> very

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's going to come down to a very very

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.990 
it's going to come down to a very very
close<00:03:20.980> battle<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.900> guys<00:03:23.019> can<00:03:23.200> see

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
close battle but as you guys can see

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.460 
close battle but as you guys can see
it's<00:03:25.000> pretty<00:03:25.450> much<00:03:25.570> now<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:26.140> going<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.320> come

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
it's pretty much now just going to come

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.320 
it's pretty much now just going to come
down<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.739> one<00:03:26.920> spine<00:03:27.220> crawler<00:03:27.430> piece<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.150> a

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
down to one spine crawler piece I have a

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.600 
down to one spine crawler piece I have a
drone<00:03:28.840> advantage<00:03:29.500> but<00:03:29.920> his<00:03:30.100> spine<00:03:30.310> crawler

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
drone advantage but his spine crawler

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.110 
drone advantage but his spine crawler
has<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.850> little<00:03:31.150> bit<00:03:31.390> more<00:03:31.540> health<00:03:31.780> so

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
has a little bit more health so

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.090 
has a little bit more health so
basically<00:03:34.120> my<00:03:34.360> my<00:03:35.050> situation<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.650> kill

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
basically my my situation here is kill

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.250 
basically my my situation here is kill
off<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.400> spaten<00:03:36.880> crawler<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.930> looks<00:03:38.110> like

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
off the spaten crawler and it looks like

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.920 
off the spaten crawler and it looks like
I<00:03:38.440> finally<00:03:38.709> killed<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.489> but<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.269> was<00:03:40.570> left<00:03:40.810> with

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
I finally killed it but I was left with

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.130 
I finally killed it but I was left with
a<00:03:41.170> single<00:03:41.739> drone<00:03:42.010> only<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.930> was<00:03:44.110> a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
a single drone only and so this was a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.290 
a single drone only and so this was a
very<00:03:44.410> very<00:03:45.040> strange<00:03:45.430> situation<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.150> me<00:03:46.209> and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
very very strange situation for me and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.610 
very very strange situation for me and
this<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.480> actually<00:03:46.780> what<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> wanted<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.350> cast

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
this is actually what I wanted the cast

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.199 
this is actually what I wanted the cast
his<00:03:47.769> game<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.519> guys<00:03:48.610> might<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:48.880> wondering<00:03:49.030> why

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
his game you guys might be wondering why

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.670 
his game you guys might be wondering why
did<00:03:49.330> why<00:03:49.630> did<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.810> cast<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.110> same<00:03:50.350> exact

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
did why did I cast the same exact

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.380 
did why did I cast the same exact
strategy<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.370> same<00:03:51.580> exact<00:03:51.910> map<00:03:52.090> again

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
strategy on the same exact map again

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.330 
strategy on the same exact map again
this<00:03:53.050> is<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.260> reason<00:03:53.410> why<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.920> thought<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.250> was

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
this is the reason why I thought it was

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.920 
this is the reason why I thought it was
kind<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.550> funny<00:03:54.760> we're<00:03:55.000> left<00:03:55.269> with<00:03:55.390> one<00:03:55.690> drone

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
kind of funny we're left with one drone

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.800 
kind of funny we're left with one drone
apiece<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:57.180> obviously<00:03:58.180> when<00:03:58.570> you're<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.750> this

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
apiece and obviously when you're in this

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.380 
apiece and obviously when you're in this
kind<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.019> situation<00:03:59.489> what<00:04:00.489> do<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.670> do<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.300> you

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
kind of situation what do you do do you

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.910 
kind of situation what do you do do you
run<00:04:01.630> your<00:04:01.840> drone<00:04:02.050> all<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.410> way<00:04:02.470> back<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.830> your

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
run your drone all the way back to your

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.300 
run your drone all the way back to your
main<00:04:03.130> not<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.690> because<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> time<00:04:06.190> it

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
main not really because in the time it

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.590 
main not really because in the time it
takes<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.550> run<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.820> back<00:04:07.000> your<00:04:07.239> opponent's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
takes to run it back your opponent's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.910 
takes to run it back your opponent's
going<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.870> able<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.140> have<00:04:08.260> more<00:04:08.500> minerals

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
going to be able to have more minerals

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
going to be able to have more minerals
and<00:04:09.190> he's<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.360> be<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.600> mine<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.870> make

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
and he's going to be on a mine and make

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.050 
and he's going to be on a mine and make
all<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:11.500> money<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.010> he's<00:04:12.489> going<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.790> an

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
all that money and he's going to have an

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.349 
all that money and he's going to have an
advantage<00:04:13.360> over<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.910> only<00:04:16.060> thing<00:04:16.180> you

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
advantage over you so the only thing you

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.020 
advantage over you so the only thing you
can<00:04:16.510> really<00:04:16.690> do<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.620> try<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.430> kill<00:04:18.820> off

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
can really do here is try to kill off

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.060 
can really do here is try to kill off
that<00:04:19.270> drone<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.720> prevent<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.320> from<00:04:20.440> mining<00:04:20.799> so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
that drone and prevent it from mining so

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.550 
that drone and prevent it from mining so
obviously<00:04:22.060> Zerg<00:04:22.600> units<00:04:22.900> all<00:04:23.080> regenerate

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
obviously Zerg units all regenerate

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
obviously Zerg units all regenerate
health<00:04:23.740> as

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
health as

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.240 
health as
they're<00:04:24.789> not<00:04:24.879> attacked<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:25.870> what<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.860> want<00:04:27.189> to

do if you're in this situation is kill
off<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.810> do<00:04:32.020> damage<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.409> his<00:04:32.680> throne<00:04:32.949> but

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
off and do damage to his throne but

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.159 
off and do damage to his throne but
don't<00:04:33.729> let<00:04:33.879> your<00:04:34.000> drone<00:04:34.180> get<00:04:34.360> hit<00:04:34.539> let<00:04:35.050> it

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
don't let your drone get hit let it

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.230 
don't let your drone get hit let it
slowly<00:04:35.379> regenerate<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.159> don't<00:04:36.759> let<00:04:36.969> it<00:04:37.030> bring

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
slowly regenerate and don't let it bring

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.730 
slowly regenerate and don't let it bring
minerals<00:04:37.659> back<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.110> every<00:04:38.349> time<00:04:38.379> your

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
minerals back so every time your

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.980 
minerals back so every time your
opponent<00:04:39.099> brings<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.639> stack<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.389> minerals<00:04:40.870> like

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
opponent brings a stack of minerals like

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.749 
opponent brings a stack of minerals like
that<00:04:41.229> he<00:04:41.740> gets<00:04:41.949> closer<00:04:42.189> and<00:04:42.340> closer<00:04:42.610> to

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
that he gets closer and closer to

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.179 
that he gets closer and closer to
building<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.300> pair<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.629> zerglings<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.259> that's

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
building a pair of zerglings and that's

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.010 
building a pair of zerglings and that's
what<00:04:45.400> makes<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.789> extremely<00:04:46.120> extremely

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
what makes it extremely extremely

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.309 
what makes it extremely extremely
difficult<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:48.400> deal<00:04:48.610> with<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:49.840> he's<00:04:50.080> able<00:04:50.169> to

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
difficult to deal with if he's able to

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.499 
difficult to deal with if he's able to
get<00:04:50.439> another<00:04:50.620> pair<00:04:50.830> out<00:04:50.949> so<00:04:51.219> I<00:04:51.430> guess<00:04:52.360> if

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
get another pair out so I guess if

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.429 
get another pair out so I guess if
you're<00:04:52.599> in<00:04:52.689> this<00:04:52.780> kind<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:52.960> situation<00:04:53.050> you're

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
you're in this kind of situation you're

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.350 
you're in this kind of situation you're
kind<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.710> screwed<00:04:54.039> because<00:04:54.759> as<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.120> guys<00:04:55.210> can

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
kind of screwed because as you guys can

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.230 
kind of screwed because as you guys can

hit that drone but each time I do that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.969 
hit that drone but each time I do that
my<00:05:01.240> opponent<00:05:01.449> gets<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.960> first<00:05:02.110> hit<00:05:02.259> off<00:05:02.379> or<00:05:02.830> he

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
my opponent gets the first hit off or he

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.920 
my opponent gets the first hit off or he

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
this run back mine some minerals try to

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.689 
this run back mine some minerals try to

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
make a pair of zerglings if possible but

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.040 
make a pair of zerglings if possible but
as<00:05:27.789> you<00:05:27.909> guys<00:05:28.029> can<00:05:28.150> see<00:05:28.210> I'm<00:05:28.419> still<00:05:28.629> very<00:05:28.779> far

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
as you guys can see I'm still very far

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.080 
as you guys can see I'm still very far
behind<00:05:29.229> I've<00:05:29.469> only<00:05:29.590> got<00:05:29.770> 13<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:32.550> not<00:05:33.550> the

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
behind I've only got 13 and so not the

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.850 
behind I've only got 13 and so not the
best<00:05:34.389> situation<00:05:34.599> I<00:05:35.139> actually<00:05:35.440> tried<00:05:35.830> to

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
best situation I actually tried to

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.769 
best situation I actually tried to
cancel<00:05:36.159> my<00:05:36.400> spine<00:05:36.879> crawler<00:05:37.120> glows<00:05:37.330> getting

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
cancel my spine crawler glows getting

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.510 
cancel my spine crawler glows getting
hit<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.289> tried<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.740> cancel<00:05:38.889> it<00:05:39.069> and<00:05:39.159> recuperate

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
hit I tried to cancel it and recuperate

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.450 
hit I tried to cancel it and recuperate
to<00:05:39.819> recuperate<00:05:40.089> my<00:05:40.419> cost<00:05:40.659> but<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.229> guess<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:42.069> got

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
to recuperate my cost but I guess it got

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.950 
to recuperate my cost but I guess it got
killed<00:05:42.819> off<00:05:43.029> before<00:05:43.389> I<00:05:43.419> was<00:05:43.539> able<00:05:43.629> to<00:05:43.779> cancel

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
killed off before I was able to cancel

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.709 
killed off before I was able to cancel
it<00:05:44.259> so<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.219> I<00:05:45.819> had<00:05:46.000> been<00:05:46.029> able<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.389> cancel<00:05:46.539> that

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
it so if I had been able to cancel that

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.990 
it so if I had been able to cancel that
spine<00:05:46.930> crawler<00:05:47.139> this<00:05:47.379> game<00:05:47.560> might<00:05:47.919> have<00:05:48.099> been

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
spine crawler this game might have been

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.360 
spine crawler this game might have been
a<00:05:49.029> little<00:05:49.240> bit<00:05:49.419> different<00:05:49.839> but<00:05:50.529> alas<00:05:50.979> it<00:05:51.009> looks

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
a little bit different but alas it looks

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.529 
a little bit different but alas it looks
like<00:05:51.520> my<00:05:51.669> opponents<00:05:52.029> gonna<00:05:52.180> have<00:05:52.389> his

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
like my opponents gonna have his

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.029 
like my opponents gonna have his
earnings<00:05:52.870> coming<00:05:53.080> in<00:05:53.259> and<00:05:53.529> there's<00:05:53.740> really

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
earnings coming in and there's really

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.899 
earnings coming in and there's really
not<00:05:54.370> much<00:05:54.639> I<00:05:54.879> could<00:05:54.969> do<00:05:55.389> so<00:05:56.259> that<00:05:56.979> is<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.520> drone

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
not much I could do so that is the drone

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.570 
not much I could do so that is the drone
versus<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.509> drone<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.050> tried<00:05:59.979> to<00:06:00.219> interrupt

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
versus the drone I tried to interrupt

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.010 
versus the drone I tried to interrupt
that<00:06:00.699> drones<00:06:00.969> my<00:06:01.180> anytime<00:06:01.479> I<00:06:01.509> try<00:06:01.629> to<00:06:01.779> bring<00:06:01.990> it

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
that drones my anytime I try to bring it

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.079 
that drones my anytime I try to bring it
in<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.349> juke<00:06:02.650> him<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:02.979> make<00:06:03.310> him<00:06:03.460> not<00:06:03.819> mine

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.089 
in and juke him and make him not mine

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.990 
in and juke him and make him not mine
minerals<00:06:04.419> but<00:06:04.750> my<00:06:05.409> opponent<00:06:05.770> sausagefest<00:06:06.099> he

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
minerals but my opponent sausagefest he

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.659 
minerals but my opponent sausagefest he
is<00:06:07.150> a<00:06:07.180> very<00:06:07.960> good<00:06:08.050> with<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> drone<00:06:08.949> micros<00:06:09.430> so

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
is a very good with the drone micros so
