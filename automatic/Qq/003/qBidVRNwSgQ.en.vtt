00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.940
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.579
 today I have brought you a very 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.340
 easy and tasty to make people go 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:22.750
 learning to do and fabric notebooks 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.740
 Let's get started, we're going to need to 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.170
 notebook 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.340
 it can be stamped capitalism 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.879
 It can be used as the fabric 5 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.519
 the print of your preference bosh had 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.350
 for us to do the finishing and scissors 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.019
 We'll start by cutting it. 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:50.260
 decisive in the size of my 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:53.489
 I cut 22 by 32 but you can cut 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.489
 in the olhômetro also reformed - the physical 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.210
 it's just you get your notebook emídio if 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.299
 He measures it and leaves more or 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.299
 one little finger away at all 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:11.229
 the left and right 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.719
 up down and you can cut it will give 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.850
 right the same way we put the 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.130
 We'll put the fabric on the notebook. 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.530
 open with the head facing up 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.009
 We'll take off just a little bit from the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.600
 woven for us by putting gradually 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.479
 Remember when the necklace leaves a 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.350
 Dino of distance difference but 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.140
 on the top and bottom sides and there with 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.659
 The same hand you go through to take 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.980
 any ball or any cattle error 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.530
 that stays in the tissue 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.020
 The idea here is gradually going. 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.020
 pulling with paper underneath 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.270
 white and how are we going? 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.550
 passing to Colombia and the fabric and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.940
 removing any balls then underneath 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.780
 there's the role we're pulling and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.650
 upon our hand will see pasting 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.620
 fabric is equal to and kapha notebook 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.720
 child in school has kompakt only that 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.650
 here our fabric is much cooler and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.100
 funny 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.860
 and then we make this move 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.050
 until you get to the double booklet 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.900
 when they came to the notebook 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.420
 We're going to close for you to have 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.460
 sure the fabric will give will not 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.750
 get stuck, nothing, then we close 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:35.220
 Pass the finger to the German collar. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.990
 so right and then we saw the notebook 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.970
 to continue doing the same process 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.200
 We got off to a good start. 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.680
 now pulling the white paper and the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 that we go hand in hand 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:57.280
 to put you put people 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.550
 It goes with the open notebook cutting the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.560
 triangle shaped tips 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.739
 four ends of our fabric that are 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.209
 left over is just cut into 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.560
 triangle to make it easier to 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.870
 discover and make the internal finish 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.820
 after that all that was left over from 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.070
 People are going to put it in. 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.709
 so we stick inside the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:25.830
 all that a drawing that the 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.830
 people left and only left to paste 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.590
 nor will we have anything like it 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.080
 this all incapable of and now finally that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.080
 we finish doing the job 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.480
 stf also chose an attack combo 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.430
 with the fabric make a different pattern 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.190
 Do you know 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.319
 and then just paste the fifa covering the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.819
 our internal nationals is not the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.099
 part that we just put 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.250
 inside we 'll cover the safe had 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:33.840
 to give a more special touch in the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:40.470
 front and back too and ready your 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.780

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.550

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.780
