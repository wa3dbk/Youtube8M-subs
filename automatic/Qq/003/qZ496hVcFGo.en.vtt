00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.510 

so<00:01:34.940> my<00:01:35.090> spec<00:01:35.390> goal<00:01:35.630> has<00:01:35.900> had<00:01:36.140> time<00:01:36.410> to<00:01:36.470> dry<00:01:36.650> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
so my spec goal has had time to dry and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
to be too perfect for this code so today

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.850 
to be too perfect for this code so today
I'm<00:01:53.360> going<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> go<00:01:53.660> ahead<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.960> use<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.410> 12

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
I'm going to go ahead and use the 12

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.510 
I'm going to go ahead and use the 12
inch<00:01:55.070> taping<00:01:55.580> knife<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:58.100> important

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
that you get a bigger one because you're

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.540 
that you get a bigger one because you're
actually<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.650> go<00:02:00.770> out<00:02:00.800> further<00:02:01.310> this

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
actually going to go out further this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.669 
actually going to go out further this
time<00:02:03.280> I'm<00:02:04.280> taking<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.880> well<00:02:05.180> beyond<00:02:05.750> my<00:02:05.869> joint

you yesterday you're gonna kind of make
almost<00:02:21.350> like<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> hill<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.250> ever<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.120> slightly

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
almost like a hill just ever so slightly

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.120 
almost like a hill just ever so slightly
but<00:02:23.780> you're<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.050> push<00:02:24.260> real<00:02:24.500> hard<00:02:24.530> here

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
but you're going to push real hard here

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.910 
but you're going to push real hard here
and<00:02:25.570> then<00:02:26.570> you're<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> go<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.290> release

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
and then you're going to go up release

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.470 
and then you're going to go up release
some<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.160> your<00:02:28.280> pressure<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.300> back

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
some of your pressure and then go back

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.570 
some of your pressure and then go back
down<00:02:29.510> side<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> make<00:02:31.340> sure<00:02:31.370> you

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
down side you want to make sure you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:45.150 
down side you want to make sure you
scrape<00:02:31.880> off<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:34.610> get<00:02:34.730> any<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.030> excess<00:02:35.390> off

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.289 

then<00:02:46.160> again<00:02:46.430> I'm<00:02:46.549> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.880> ahead<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.209> let

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
then again I'm going to go ahead and let

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.340 
then again I'm going to go ahead and let
this<00:02:47.450> dry<00:02:47.780> overnight

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
this dry overnight

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.830 
this dry overnight
and<00:02:48.650> then<00:02:49.280> once<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:49.820> dry<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.600> go<00:02:50.750> ahead

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and then once it's dry I can go ahead

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
and then once it's dry I can go ahead
and<00:02:50.989> sand<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.130> edges<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.549> little<00:02:52.820> bit

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and sand just the edges a little bit

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.060 
and sand just the edges a little bit
kind<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.239> sand<00:02:53.540> down<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> little<00:02:54.170> bit<00:02:54.410> on<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
kind of sand down a little bit on the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.860 
kind of sand down a little bit on the
middle<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.549> it's<00:02:55.670> not<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.120> much<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.480> hump<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
middle so it's not so much of a hump and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.110 
middle so it's not so much of a hump and
then<00:02:56.959> any<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> little<00:02:58.519> ridges<00:02:58.700> I'll<00:02:58.970> go

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
then any of the little ridges I'll go

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.060 
then any of the little ridges I'll go
ahead<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.390> sand<00:02:59.540> down<00:02:59.780> that's<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.620> once<00:03:00.890> you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
ahead and sand down that's it once you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.590 
ahead and sand down that's it once you
finish<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.580> you're<00:03:01.820> ready<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.060> prime<00:03:02.330> and
