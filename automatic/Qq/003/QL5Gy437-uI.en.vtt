calories you're expending if you eat

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.000 
calories you're expending if you eat
more<00:02:57.600> than<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.870> burn<00:02:58.110> you're<00:02:58.680> going<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> gain

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
more than you burn you're going to gain

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.860 
more than you burn you're going to gain
way<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.460> eat<00:02:59.820> less<00:03:00.180> than<00:03:00.210> you<00:03:00.540> burn<00:03:00.690> you're

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
way if you eat less than you burn you're

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.300 
way if you eat less than you burn you're
going<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> lose<00:03:01.200> weight<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.710> eat<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
going to lose weight if you eat what you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
going to lose weight if you eat what you
gain<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.390> expend<00:03:04.080> you're<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.320> stay

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
gain what you expend you're gonna stay

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.100 
gain what you expend you're gonna stay
the<00:03:04.800> same<00:03:05.010> okay<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.640> that's<00:03:06.210> why<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.510> does<00:03:06.840> work

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the same okay so that's why it does work

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.110 
the same okay so that's why it does work
now<00:03:07.320> performance<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.430> things<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.850> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
now performance and things like that is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
now performance and things like that is
a<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.360> different<00:03:09.600> because<00:03:09.840> micro<00:03:10.380> nutrients

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
a bit different because micro nutrients

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.890 
a bit different because micro nutrients
and<00:03:11.100> minerals<00:03:11.250> vitamins<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.390> minerals<00:03:12.720> come

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and minerals vitamins and minerals come

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900 
and minerals vitamins and minerals come
into<00:03:13.110> play<00:03:13.290> I'm<00:03:13.500> speaking<00:03:14.160> specifically

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
into play I'm speaking specifically

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.420 
into play I'm speaking specifically
towards<00:03:15.450> body<00:03:15.750> composition<00:03:16.290> fat<00:03:17.160> loss

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
towards body composition fat loss

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.190 
towards body composition fat loss
competition<00:03:18.030> dieting<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.780> things<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.140> that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
competition dieting and things like that

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.979 
competition dieting and things like that
so<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.920> does<00:03:20.160> work<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.420> don't<00:03:21.540> personally

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
so it does work now I don't personally

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.750 
so it does work now I don't personally
recommend<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.220> out<00:03:23.310> there<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.640> eat

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
recommend that you go out there and eat

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
recommend that you go out there and eat
as<00:03:23.880> much<00:03:24.420> food<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> possibly<00:03:25.350> can

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
as much food as you possibly can

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.990 
as much food as you possibly can
and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.860> personally<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:26.430> think<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.760> could<00:03:26.910> be

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and I personally don't think it could be

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.820 
and I personally don't think it could be
done<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.140> still<00:03:28.380> need<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.650> have<00:03:28.800> a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
done I think you still need to have a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.280 
done I think you still need to have a
balance<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.520> good<00:03:30.060> clean<00:03:30.450> foods<00:03:30.900> whatever

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
balance of good clean foods whatever

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.320 
balance of good clean foods whatever
that<00:03:31.470> means<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.340> know<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.580> my<00:03:32.610> definition

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
that means but you know in my definition

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.030 
that means but you know in my definition
of<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> clean<00:03:33.720> food<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.200> food<00:03:34.709> high<00:03:35.010> in

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
of a clean food is food high in

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.760 
of a clean food is food high in
micronutrients<00:03:36.030> micro<00:03:36.720> minerals<00:03:36.900> foods<00:03:37.620> that

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
micronutrients micro minerals foods that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.370 
micronutrients micro minerals foods that
are<00:03:37.920> very<00:03:38.040> calorie<00:03:38.580> uh<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.720> not<00:03:39.900> calorie

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
are very calorie uh that are not calorie

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.500 
are very calorie uh that are not calorie
dense<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.010> foods<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.760> don't<00:03:41.970> have<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.239> lot<00:03:42.330> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
dense so foods that don't have a lot of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.740 
dense so foods that don't have a lot of
calories<00:03:42.810> per<00:03:43.290> hundred<00:03:43.650> grams<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.130> weight<00:03:44.750> so

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
calories per hundred grams of weight so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.030 
calories per hundred grams of weight so
you<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.959> something<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.380> chocolate<00:03:46.890> bar

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
you know something like a chocolate bar

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.530 
you know something like a chocolate bar
would<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> lot<00:03:47.550> more<00:03:47.700> calories<00:03:48.239> per

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
would have a lot more calories per

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.390 
would have a lot more calories per
hundred<00:03:49.230> grams<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.709> something<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.070> broccoli

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
hundred grams in something like broccoli

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.210 
hundred grams in something like broccoli
obviously<00:03:51.150> um<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:52.800> long<00:03:52.950> as<00:03:53.010> you're

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
obviously um so as long as you're

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.970 
obviously um so as long as you're
hitting<00:03:53.520> your<00:03:53.640> protein<00:03:54.150> carb<00:03:54.690> fiber<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.860> your

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
hitting your protein carb fiber and your

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.270 
hitting your protein carb fiber and your
fats<00:03:56.690> that's<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:58.080> flexible<00:03:58.620> dieting<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:59.100> so

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
fats that's what flexible dieting is so

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.830 
fats that's what flexible dieting is so
if<00:03:59.370> you're<00:03:59.520> allotted<00:03:59.790> 100<00:04:00.270> grams<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.630> protein

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
if you're allotted 100 grams of protein

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.010 
if you're allotted 100 grams of protein
200<00:04:01.530> grams<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.920> carbs<00:04:02.280> 80<00:04:03.209> grams<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.810> fats

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
200 grams of carbs 80 grams of fats

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.240 
200 grams of carbs 80 grams of fats
let's<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:04.440> use<00:04:04.560> those<00:04:04.770> numbers<00:04:04.890> for

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
let's just use those numbers for

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.490 
let's just use those numbers for
examples<00:04:05.670> sake<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.090> long<00:04:06.780> as<00:04:06.810> you're<00:04:07.140> hitting

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
examples sake as long as you're hitting

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.050 
examples sake as long as you're hitting
those<00:04:07.650> numbers<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.370> eat<00:04:08.519> whatever<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
those numbers you can eat whatever you

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.550 
those numbers you can eat whatever you
want<00:04:09.090> as<00:04:09.480> long<00:04:09.510> as<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.840> don't<00:04:10.019> go<00:04:10.140> over<00:04:10.470> if

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
want as long as you don't go over if

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.380 
want as long as you don't go over if
you're<00:04:10.709> trying<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.980> lose<00:04:11.160> weight<00:04:11.430> now<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.150> does

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
you're trying to lose weight now it does

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.840 
you're trying to lose weight now it does
work<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.900> still<00:04:13.440> recommend<00:04:13.850> implementing

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
work I still recommend implementing

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.400 
work I still recommend implementing
other<00:04:15.150> food<00:04:15.450> say<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.900> have<00:04:16.049> an<00:04:16.140> array<00:04:16.380> of

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
other food say that you have an array of

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.050 
other food say that you have an array of
vitamins<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.220> minerals<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.880> have

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
vitamins and minerals so that you have

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.300 
vitamins and minerals so that you have
an<00:04:18.150> array<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.799> nutrients<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:19.979> get<00:04:20.100> better

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
an array of nutrients so you get better

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.969 
an array of nutrients so you get better
nutrient<00:04:20.850> absorption<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.020> reduce

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
nutrient absorption so that you reduce

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.430 
nutrient absorption so that you reduce
inflammation

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
inflammation

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.110 
inflammation
so<00:04:24.560> there<00:04:24.710> are<00:04:24.740> definitely<00:04:25.310> benefits<00:04:25.940> to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so there are definitely benefits to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.790 
so there are definitely benefits to
doing<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.480> from<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.750> psychological<00:04:27.200> standpoint

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
doing it from a psychological standpoint

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.410 
doing it from a psychological standpoint
that<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.280> guys<00:04:28.460> are<00:04:28.640> not<00:04:28.790> eating<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.210> same

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
that you guys are not eating the same

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.210 
that you guys are not eating the same
foods<00:04:29.690> over<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.140> over<00:04:30.230> it's<00:04:30.710> not<00:04:30.860> repetitive

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
foods over and over it's not repetitive

just going to touch on it very quickly
the<00:06:03.169> glycemic<00:06:03.680> index<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:04.130> not<00:06:04.280> as<00:06:04.580> important

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
the glycemic index is not as important

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
when you're consuming foods together

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.790 
when you're consuming foods together
combine<00:06:08.030> collectively<00:06:08.720> the<00:06:09.260> reason<00:06:09.590> why<00:06:09.740> is

the glycemic index or the glycemic index
of<00:06:12.169> foods<00:06:12.410> is<00:06:12.590> measured<00:06:13.370> on<00:06:13.520> an<00:06:13.640> empty<00:06:13.880> stomach

of foods is measured on an empty stomach

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.240 
of foods is measured on an empty stomach
so<00:06:15.140> they<00:06:15.290> measure<00:06:15.590> all<00:06:15.890> these<00:06:16.040> different

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
so they measure all these different

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.100 
so they measure all these different
carbohydrates<00:06:17.090> consumed<00:06:17.630> on<00:06:17.780> an<00:06:17.930> empty

stomach<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:18.770> then<00:06:19.130> they<00:06:19.370> look<00:06:19.730> at<00:06:19.850> the

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
stomach and then they look at the

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.300 
stomach and then they look at the

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
response it has to your insulin levels

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.130

now<00:06:22.790> this<00:06:23.000> doesn't<00:06:23.210> matter<00:06:23.510> because<00:06:23.780> if<00:06:23.990> now

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
now this doesn't matter because if now

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.050 
now this doesn't matter because if now
you're<00:06:24.320> eating<00:06:24.590> protein<00:06:24.919> with<00:06:25.760> a
