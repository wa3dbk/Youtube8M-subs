by opening up that and looking in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070 
by opening up that and looking in
through<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> different<00:01:21.150> lens<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.630> were<00:01:21.750> able<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
through a different lens we were able to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
through a different lens we were able to
see<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.680> every<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> those<00:01:23.400> kids<00:01:23.610> should

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
see that every one of those kids should

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.789 
see that every one of those kids should
have<00:01:23.939> gone<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.200> gave<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have gone on and that gave me a lot of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
have gone on and that gave me a lot of
motivation<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.880> drive<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:27.930> sure

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
motivation to drive and to make sure

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
motivation to drive and to make sure
that<00:01:28.320> every<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> those<00:01:28.950> kids<00:01:29.189> around<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that every one of those kids around the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.109 
that every one of those kids around the
country<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.590> North<00:01:31.799> Chicago<00:01:32.119> are

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
country and not just North Chicago are

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.030 
country and not just North Chicago are
exposed<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.020> opportunities<00:01:34.740> early

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
exposed to those opportunities early

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
exposed to those opportunities early
enough<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> difference

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
enough where they can make a difference

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.810 
enough where they can make a difference
and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.729> have

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and then so that way then they they have
