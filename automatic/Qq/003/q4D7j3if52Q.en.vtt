okay this is some notes on the I want
extreme<00:00:18.850> quadcopter<00:00:19.850> things<00:00:20.300> that<00:00:20.420> have

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
extreme quadcopter things that have

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.720 
extreme quadcopter things that have
learned<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.939> one<00:00:22.939> thing<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:23.150> learned<00:00:23.270> was<00:00:24.730> once

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
learned and one thing I learned was once

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.370 
learned and one thing I learned was once
you<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:28.640> have<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:28.849> plug<00:00:29.180> in<00:00:29.390> here<00:00:29.779> first<00:00:30.140> and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
you you have to plug in here first and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.799 
you you have to plug in here first and
then<00:00:30.470> live<00:00:30.800> battery<00:00:31.130> in<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.250> tray<00:00:31.519> I<00:00:31.789> got<00:00:32.689> this

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
then live battery in the tray I got this

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.780 
then live battery in the tray I got this
velcro<00:00:33.290> around<00:00:33.379> it<00:00:36.250> works<00:00:37.250> every<00:00:37.519> time<00:00:39.790> the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
velcro around it works every time the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.900 
velcro around it works every time the
challenge<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.660> found<00:00:41.930> was<00:00:42.110> putting<00:00:42.470> this<00:00:42.910> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
challenge I found was putting this the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.310 
challenge I found was putting this the
aerial<00:00:44.330> camera<00:00:44.660> tray<00:00:44.930> I'm<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.769> quad<00:00:46.489> itself<00:00:47.320> you

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
aerial camera tray I'm a quad itself you

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.440 
aerial camera tray I'm a quad itself you
have<00:00:48.350> these<00:00:48.590> four<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.980> four<00:00:52.070> small<00:00:53.059> pins

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
have these four it's four small pins

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.740 
have these four it's four small pins
right<00:00:54.020> there<00:00:54.500> actually<00:00:54.920> sockets<00:00:55.450> that<00:00:56.450> need

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
right there actually sockets that need

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.040 
right there actually sockets that need
to<00:00:56.989> be<00:00:57.320> aligned<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:57.920> these<00:00:58.250> little<00:00:58.610> pins<00:00:59.050> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
to be aligned with these little pins and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.139 
to be aligned with these little pins and
I<00:01:00.199> ended<00:01:00.500> up<00:01:00.620> not<00:01:01.100> aligning<00:01:01.489> one<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.820> those<00:01:01.940> and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
I ended up not aligning one of those and

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.920 
I ended up not aligning one of those and
it<00:01:02.239> bent<00:01:02.570> matched<00:01:04.149> pretty<00:01:05.149> well<00:01:05.390> although<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
it bent matched pretty well although I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.279 
it bent matched pretty well although I
did<00:01:06.140> fix<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:07.430> some<00:01:07.580> pliers<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.170> strain<00:01:09.170> it

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
did fix it with some pliers I strain it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.639 
did fix it with some pliers I strain it
out<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:09.820> too<00:01:10.820> easily<00:01:11.360> more<00:01:11.930> easily<00:01:11.990> put<00:01:12.500> this

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
out but too easily more easily put this

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.210 
out but too easily more easily put this
on<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.190> best<00:01:13.430> way<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.640> found<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.509> just<00:01:18.220> set

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
on the best way I found is to just set

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.600 
on the best way I found is to just set
the<00:01:19.310> quad<00:01:19.550> upside<00:01:19.849> down<00:01:20.030> on<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.319> table<00:01:21.319> and<00:01:22.190> get

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
the quad upside down on a table and get

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.440 
the quad upside down on a table and get
this<00:01:22.759> kind<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.209> started<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:25.399> then<00:01:25.670> hold<00:01:26.240> it

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
this kind of started and then hold it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.260 
this kind of started and then hold it
and<00:01:27.259> look

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
and look

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.469 
and look
look<00:01:29.270> through<00:01:29.660> here<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:31.340> line<00:01:31.550> one<00:01:31.910> end<00:01:34.479> up

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
look through here the line one end up

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.630 
look through here the line one end up
the<00:01:35.750> sockets<00:01:36.170> with<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.410> pins<00:01:36.649> just<00:01:37.250> get<00:01:37.429> them

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
the sockets with the pins just get them

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.540 
the sockets with the pins just get them
barely<00:01:38.030> started<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:40.069> I'm<00:01:40.190> gonna<00:01:40.340> turn

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
barely started and then I'm gonna turn

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.339 
barely started and then I'm gonna turn
it<00:01:40.729> around<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.479> do<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:42.220> same<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.270> end

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.380 

that's<00:01:48.349> quite<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.099> find<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.700> quite<00:01:49.880> difficult

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
that's quite I find it quite difficult

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.910 
that's quite I find it quite difficult
to<00:01:50.929> get<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.229> aligned<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:53.349> make<00:01:54.349> sure<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.560> all

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
to get it aligned but make sure that all

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.229 
to get it aligned but make sure that all
four<00:01:54.950> are<00:01:55.640> line<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:56.569> press<00:01:57.910> at<00:01:58.910> home<00:01:59.090> of

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
four are line and then press at home of

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.469 
four are line and then press at home of
course<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.630> don't<00:01:59.810> know<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.959> battery<00:02:01.479> for

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
course I don't know the battery for

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.219 
course I don't know the battery for
demonstration<00:02:03.020> purposes<00:02:04.810> another<00:02:05.810> way<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:05.989> put

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
demonstration purposes another way I put

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.680 
demonstration purposes another way I put
this<00:02:06.470> little<00:02:08.170> GoPro<00:02:09.170> knock<00:02:09.649> off<00:02:10.690> sharper

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690

Lord<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.230> haven't<00:02:16.530> measured<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.070> don't<00:02:17.220> know

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
Lord I haven't measured it I don't know

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.920 
Lord I haven't measured it I don't know
if<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.520> exactly<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.120> same<00:02:18.300> Papa<00:02:18.780> isn't

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
if it's exactly the same Papa isn't

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.450 
if it's exactly the same Papa isn't
exactly<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> got<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.040> pretty<00:02:20.160> close

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
exactly but it's got to be pretty close

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.720 
exactly but it's got to be pretty close
to<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> GoPro<00:02:22.520> way<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:28.250> velcro<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to a GoPro way but this on is velcro the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.720 
to a GoPro way but this on is velcro the
hook<00:02:29.940> side<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.830> loops<00:02:32.190> are<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
hook side here the loops are on the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.360 
hook side here the loops are on the
camera<00:02:34.040> top<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.250> bottom<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.650> take

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
camera top and bottom so that I can take

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.710 
camera top and bottom so that I can take
this<00:02:38.490> camera<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.030> free<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.600> it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
this camera and just free with it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.870 
this camera and just free with it
and<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:39.960> not<00:02:40.140> rubbing<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.160> against<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and I'm not rubbing up against the the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.870 
and I'm not rubbing up against the the
rough<00:02:42.300> hook<00:02:42.510> side<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.070> end<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.250> starting<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
rough hook side so I end up starting the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.110 
rough hook side so I end up starting the
camera<00:02:45.590> with<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.770> button<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> right<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
camera with that button on the right and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.290 
camera with that button on the right and
then<00:02:48.530> while<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.650> running<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:53.090> stick<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
then while it's running I stick it to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.670 
then while it's running I stick it to
the<00:02:54.390> velcro<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:57.570> course<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.960> want<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.230> point

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the velcro and of course I want to point

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.480 
the velcro and of course I want to point
down<00:02:59.660> just<00:03:00.660> back<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.260> case<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.860> little<00:03:02.280> bit

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
down just back in this case a little bit

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.960 
down just back in this case a little bit
about<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.940> angle<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.490> take<00:03:05.700> these

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
about that angle so then I take these

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.710 
about that angle so then I take these
short<00:03:06.270> velcro<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:08.580> red<00:03:09.150> velcro<00:03:09.570> is

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
short velcro this red velcro is

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
short velcro this red velcro is
double-sided<00:03:12.200> down<00:03:14.150> impossible<00:03:15.150> almost

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
double-sided down impossible almost

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.990 
double-sided down impossible almost
impossible<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.960> do<00:03:16.050> one<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:18.420> other<00:03:19.940> end<00:03:20.940> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
impossible to do one in the other end of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.590 
impossible to do one in the other end of
the<00:03:21.150> strap<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.600> wrap<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.989> around<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:24.480> is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the strap I wrap that around so it is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.990 
the strap I wrap that around so it is
secured<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:28.190> almost<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.489> right<00:03:29.640> angle

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
secured that is almost the right angle

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.270 
secured that is almost the right angle
I'm<00:03:30.090> gonna<00:03:30.270> say<00:03:30.420> that's<00:03:30.630> almost<00:03:31.100> too<00:03:32.100> much

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
I'm gonna say that's almost too much

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.390 
I'm gonna say that's almost too much
down<00:03:33.230> probably<00:03:34.230> want<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.560> little<00:03:34.920> bit<00:03:35.040> less

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
down probably want a little bit less

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.930 
down probably want a little bit less
than<00:03:35.670> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
than that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.500 
than that
okay<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.360> move<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> enough<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:41.510> think

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
okay I can move it enough but think

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.750 
okay I can move it enough but think
about<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.110> angle<00:03:43.680> right<00:03:44.070> there<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.580> what<00:03:44.730> I

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
about that angle right there is what I

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.150 
about that angle right there is what I
found<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.360> just<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.590> unfortunately

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
found to be just right so unfortunately

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
found to be just right so unfortunately
you're<00:03:50.910> handling<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:51.510> thing<00:03:51.570> with<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
you're handling this thing with the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.949 
you're handling this thing with the
battery<00:03:52.790> plugged<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> energizing<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
battery plugged in and energizing the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.479 
battery plugged in and energizing the
quad<00:03:55.610> before<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:57.290> put<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> camera<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.160> I

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
quad before you put the camera on and I

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.020 
quad before you put the camera on and I
haven't<00:04:00.090> not<00:04:00.209> had<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.540> start<00:04:00.930> by<00:04:01.080> itself<00:04:01.470> I

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
haven't not had it start by itself I

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.509 
haven't not had it start by itself I
usually<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.140> then<00:04:04.470> turn<00:04:05.370> on

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
usually do all of this and then turn on

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.060 
usually do all of this and then turn on
the<00:04:05.640> transmitter<00:04:05.880> after<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.540> set<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.170> up<00:04:07.260> right

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.040 

the<00:04:11.070> other<00:04:11.190> thing<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.670> I'm<00:04:12.300> not<00:04:12.360> using<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
the other thing is I'm not using the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.430 
the other thing is I'm not using the
standard<00:04:13.530> receiver<00:04:13.800> I've<00:04:14.100> added<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.580> this

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
standard receiver I've added this this

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.520 
standard receiver I've added this this
little<00:04:16.440> mini<00:04:16.919> receiver

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.590 

it's<00:04:20.130> high-tech<00:04:20.519> compatible<00:04:21.090> since<00:04:21.360> that<00:04:21.480> I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
it's high-tech compatible since that I

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.830 
it's high-tech compatible since that I
took<00:04:21.660> transmitter<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.270> camera<00:04:24.600> is<00:04:24.660> not

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
took transmitter and the camera is not

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.380 
took transmitter and the camera is not
going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.260> focus<00:04:25.910> okay<00:04:26.910> great

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
going to focus okay great

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.680 
going to focus okay great
I<00:04:28.550> love<00:04:29.550> technology<00:04:29.790> when<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.270> doesn't<00:04:30.480> work

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
I love technology when it doesn't work

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.610 
I love technology when it doesn't work
very<00:04:30.720> well<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:32.090> I've<00:04:33.090> got<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.330> little<00:04:33.630> mini

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
very well but I've got this little mini

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.640 
very well but I've got this little mini
receiver<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:36.660> little<00:04:36.930> antenna<00:04:37.170> sticking<00:04:37.440> out

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
receiver the little antenna sticking out

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.800 
receiver the little antenna sticking out
to<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.920> side<00:04:38.130> I've<00:04:38.400> got<00:04:38.550> some<00:04:38.910> silicone

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
to the side I've got some silicone

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.500 
to the side I've got some silicone
sealant<00:04:40.520> I've<00:04:41.520> added<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.150> base<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.450> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
sealant I've added the base of the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.630 
sealant I've added the base of the
antenna<00:04:42.810> because<00:04:43.020> I've<00:04:43.590> had<00:04:43.920> these<00:04:44.040> I've<00:04:44.490> seen

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
antenna because I've had these I've seen

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.420 
antenna because I've had these I've seen
these<00:04:44.790> fall<00:04:44.970> off<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.650> main<00:04:46.800> you'll<00:04:46.980> walk<00:04:47.220> will

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
these fall off the main you'll walk will

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.680 
these fall off the main you'll walk will
walk<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.730> through<00:04:47.910> using<00:04:48.090> ppm<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
walk you through using ppm that the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.810 
walk you through using ppm that the
manual<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.020> comes<00:04:52.200> with<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.500> receiver<00:04:52.860> so

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
manual that comes with this receiver so

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.790 
manual that comes with this receiver so
this<00:04:53.970> is<00:04:54.120> all<00:04:54.390> running<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.750> ppm<00:04:55.200> back<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
this is all running on ppm back to the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.860 
this is all running on ppm back to the
flight<00:04:56.190> control<00:04:56.310> board<00:04:57.590> so<00:04:59.480> it<00:05:00.480> looks<00:05:00.660> like

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
flight control board so it looks like

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.170 
flight control board so it looks like
and<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.710> typically<00:05:02.100> have<00:05:02.220> had<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:04.430> like<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
and I typically have had it like the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.090 
and I typically have had it like the
camera<00:05:06.510> shooting<00:05:06.720> toward<00:05:07.080> me<00:05:07.290> this<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.710> tail

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
camera shooting toward me this is tail

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.830 
camera shooting toward me this is tail
in-flight<00:05:08.640> which<00:05:08.910> is<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.180> easiest<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:10.130> I

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
in-flight which is the easiest and I

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.380 
in-flight which is the easiest and I
could<00:05:12.840> easily<00:05:12.990> turn<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.410> camera<00:05:13.770> wrong<00:05:14.010> and

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
could easily turn the camera wrong and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.270 
could easily turn the camera wrong and
if<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.780> had<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.140> Sun<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.440> my<00:05:16.560> back<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.040> wanted

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
if I had the Sun to my back and I wanted

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640 
if I had the Sun to my back and I wanted
to<00:05:17.370> shoot<00:05:17.910> what<00:05:18.090> was<00:05:18.270> more<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:18.870> front<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.200> me<00:05:19.290> or

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
to shoot what was more in front of me or

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.460 
to shoot what was more in front of me or
in<00:05:19.740> front<00:05:19.890> of<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.070> quad<00:05:20.220> than<00:05:20.430> behind<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.120> I

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
in front of the quad than behind so I

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.659 
in front of the quad than behind so I
have<00:05:22.470> not<00:05:22.650> tried<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.100> way<00:05:23.250> my<00:05:23.430> shirt

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
have not tried it that way my shirt

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.620 
have not tried it that way my shirt
would<00:05:23.760> be<00:05:23.910> fine

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.630 

and<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.870> other<00:05:28.080> thing<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.680> forgot<00:05:29.370> to

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
and the other thing that I forgot to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.550 
and the other thing that I forgot to
talk<00:05:29.820> about<00:05:30.000> was<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.630> flight<00:05:30.900> times<00:05:31.169> with<00:05:31.440> the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
talk about was the flight times with the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.590 
talk about was the flight times with the
batteries<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:34.470> stock<00:05:35.150> 800<00:05:36.150> milliamp<00:05:36.450> hour

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
batteries the stock 800 milliamp hour

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.500 
batteries the stock 800 milliamp hour
battery<00:05:37.190> with<00:05:38.190> this<00:05:38.430> setup<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.000> this<00:05:39.180> camera

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
battery with this setup and this camera

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.120 
battery with this setup and this camera
is<00:05:39.570> actually<00:05:39.900> quite<00:05:40.410> heavy<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:40.740> can't<00:05:41.010> remember

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
is actually quite heavy I can't remember

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.060 
is actually quite heavy I can't remember
if<00:05:41.940> it's<00:05:43.820> 60<00:05:44.820> or<00:05:45.060> 70<00:05:45.570> grams<00:05:45.840> maybe<00:05:46.290> 80<00:05:46.530> grams

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
if it's 60 or 70 grams maybe 80 grams

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.610 
if it's 60 or 70 grams maybe 80 grams
I<00:05:49.040> think<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.100> möbius<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.610> 42<00:05:51.480> around<00:05:52.470> that

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
I think the möbius is 42 around that

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.340 
I think the möbius is 42 around that
ballpark<00:05:53.070> so<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.270> quite<00:05:54.450> a<00:05:54.540> heavy<00:05:54.810> camera

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
ballpark so this is quite a heavy camera

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.700 
ballpark so this is quite a heavy camera
so<00:05:55.919> with<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.190> standard<00:05:56.580> black<00:05:57.470> 800<00:05:58.470> million

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
so with the standard black 800 million

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.159 
so with the standard black 800 million
power<00:05:58.860> battery<00:05:59.240> it<00:06:00.240> has<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.080> flight<00:06:01.470> time<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:03.169> 10

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
power battery it has a flight time of 10

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.110 
power battery it has a flight time of 10
minutes<00:06:04.530> with<00:06:04.800> these<00:06:05.010> standard<00:06:05.640> propellers

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
minutes with these standard propellers

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.890 
minutes with these standard propellers
the<00:06:06.450> shorter<00:06:07.169> legs<00:06:07.380> and<00:06:08.130> no<00:06:08.880> camera<00:06:09.390> no<00:06:09.570> flight

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
the shorter legs and no camera no flight

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.280 
the shorter legs and no camera no flight
getting<00:06:10.680> so<00:06:11.669> standard<00:06:12.060> configuration<00:06:12.690> is<00:06:12.810> 10

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
getting so standard configuration is 10

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.480 
getting so standard configuration is 10
minutes<00:06:13.500> and<00:06:14.150> then<00:06:15.150> in<00:06:15.900> flight<00:06:16.890> mode<00:06:17.220> or

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
minutes and then in flight mode or

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.190 
minutes and then in flight mode or
camera<00:06:17.790> mode<00:06:17.970> with<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.270> camera<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.810> the

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
camera mode with the camera the the

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.220 
camera mode with the camera the the
flight<00:06:19.440> tray<00:06:19.980> the<00:06:20.610> camera<00:06:20.850> tray<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.930> other

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
flight tray the camera tray the other

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.370 
flight tray the camera tray the other
high<00:06:22.919> lift<00:06:23.160> propellers<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:24.990> longer<00:06:25.290> legs

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
high lift propellers and the longer legs

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.200 
high lift propellers and the longer legs
is<00:06:28.380> running<00:06:28.740> 8<00:06:28.890> minutes

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
is running 8 minutes

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.240 
is running 8 minutes
and<00:06:30.990> then<00:06:31.140> I<00:06:31.200> also<00:06:31.350> bought<00:06:31.500> these<00:06:31.770> spare

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
and then I also bought these spare

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.040 
and then I also bought these spare
batteries<00:06:32.610> these<00:06:33.150> are<00:06:33.300> actually<00:06:33.660> I<00:06:33.900> think

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
batteries these are actually I think

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.830 
batteries these are actually I think
intended<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.890> use<00:06:35.070> the<00:06:35.400> camera<00:06:35.700> it's<00:06:36.570> a<00:06:36.660> higher

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
intended to use the camera it's a higher

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.380 
intended to use the camera it's a higher
capacity<00:06:36.990> so<00:06:37.650> these<00:06:37.770> 11<00:06:38.220> 50<00:06:38.610> million<00:06:39.240> power

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
capacity so these 11 50 million power

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.320 
capacity so these 11 50 million power
batteries<00:06:39.840> are<00:06:40.340> 14<00:06:41.340> minutes<00:06:41.670> in<00:06:41.910> the<00:06:42.000> standard

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
batteries are 14 minutes in the standard

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.190 
batteries are 14 minutes in the standard
configuration<00:06:42.510> and<00:06:44.030> nine<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.180> a<00:06:45.210> half<00:06:45.420> nine

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
configuration and nine and a half nine

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.150 
configuration and nine and a half nine
and<00:06:46.410> three<00:06:46.500> quarters<00:06:46.530> with<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:48.270> camera<00:06:49.130> so<00:06:50.130> I

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
and three quarters with the camera so I

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.210 
and three quarters with the camera so I
fly<00:06:51.350> typically<00:06:52.350> a<00:06:52.440> couple<00:06:52.680> minutes<00:06:52.800> side<00:06:53.130> of

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
fly typically a couple minutes side of

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.590 
fly typically a couple minutes side of
that<00:06:53.310> just<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.610> make<00:06:53.760> sure<00:06:53.820> because<00:06:54.150> when<00:06:54.540> it

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
that just to make sure because when it

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.420 
that just to make sure because when it
runs<00:06:54.720> out<00:06:54.840> battery<00:06:55.170> it<00:06:55.770> falls<00:06:56.100> out<00:06:56.250> of<00:06:56.280> the<00:06:56.400> sky

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
runs out battery it falls out of the sky

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:06.310 
runs out battery it falls out of the sky
like<00:06:56.640> a<00:06:56.820> brick

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.380
