00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
being inside a wind market the answer is

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.540 
being inside a wind market the answer is
through<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.539> wind<00:01:49.750> place<00:01:49.990> prefix<00:01:50.679> when<00:01:51.520> I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
through the wind place prefix when I

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.730 
through the wind place prefix when I
start<00:01:51.940> with<00:01:52.179> wind<00:01:52.390> place<00:01:52.630> then<00:01:53.170> everything

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
start with wind place then everything

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.870 
start with wind place then everything
that<00:01:53.770> comes<00:01:54.250> next

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
that comes next

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.749 
that comes next
applies<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> opposite<00:01:56.229> market<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.429> here
