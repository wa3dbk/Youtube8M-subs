the original gravity guy which had you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
the original gravity guy which had you
slipping<00:00:33.000> gravity<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.780> order<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> jump<00:00:34.800> back

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
ceiling this gravity guy is reimagined

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.100 
ceiling this gravity guy is reimagined
as<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.899> endless<00:00:40.739> runner<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:42.989> just

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
as an endless runner so you're just

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.810 
as an endless runner so you're just
trying<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> run<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.890> far<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.489> there's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
trying to run as far as you can there's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.110 
trying to run as far as you can there's
no<00:00:44.969> story<00:00:45.360> mode<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.930> time<00:00:46.879> which<00:00:47.879> basically

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
no story mode this time which basically

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
no story mode this time which basically
means<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.140> less<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
means there's a little bit less of a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
means there's a little bit less of a
game<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.550> actual<00:00:50.850> core<00:00:51.510> game<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> lot

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
game but the actual core game is a lot

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
game but the actual core game is a lot
more<00:00:52.890> solid<00:00:53.100> than<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> original<00:00:54.000> gravity<00:00:54.180> guy

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
more solid than the original gravity guy

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930 
more solid than the original gravity guy
which<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.980> ridiculously<00:00:55.980> hard<00:00:56.190> especially

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
which was ridiculously hard especially

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.110 
which was ridiculously hard especially
after<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.850> there<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.969> two

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
after they have two in it there are two

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
after they have two in it there are two
different<00:01:00.390> ways<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.899> interact<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> game

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
different ways to interact with the game

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
different ways to interact with the game
you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.399> raise<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> lower<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.239> floor<00:01:03.510> which

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you can raise and lower the floor which

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
you can raise and lower the floor which
I<00:01:03.960> find<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> easiest<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.040> get

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I find to be the easiest way to get

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.450 
I find to be the easiest way to get
around<00:01:06.170> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> land<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.619> those<00:01:07.799> green<00:01:08.100> spots

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
around if you land all those green spots

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
around if you land all those green spots
you<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> perfect<00:01:09.299> landing<00:01:09.659> which<00:01:09.840> gets<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you get a perfect landing which gets you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
you get a perfect landing which gets you
a<00:01:10.200> coin<00:01:10.500> bonus<00:01:10.890> you're<00:01:11.280> supposed<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> avoid

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
a coin bonus you're supposed to avoid

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
a coin bonus you're supposed to avoid
enemies<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.390> course<00:01:13.040> now<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.280> farther<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
enemies of course now I got farther so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
enemies of course now I got farther so
the<00:01:14.970> coins<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.390> worth<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:16.220> gotta<00:01:17.220> throw

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the coins are worth more gotta throw

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
the coins are worth more gotta throw
them<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> did<00:01:18.720> supposed

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
them up over that which I did supposed

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.780 
them up over that which I did supposed
to<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.650> through<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.009> green<00:01:20.250> things<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.640> get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

to go through these green things and get
another<00:01:21.030> clone<00:01:21.330> bonus<00:01:21.810> bonus<00:01:24.740> now<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.369> gravity

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
another clone bonus bonus now a gravity

another clone bonus bonus now a gravity
guy<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.299> jump<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:27.990> double<00:01:28.290> jump<00:01:28.500> with

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
guy can also jump or double jump with

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.730 
guy can also jump or double jump with
left<00:01:29.400> button<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> entirety<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
left button and that's the entirety of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
left button and that's the entirety of
the<00:01:31.829> input<00:01:32.130> you've<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.490> got<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.670> jump

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the input you've just got your jump

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
the input you've just got your jump
button<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.439> lips<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.930> raise<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
button and your lips and your raise and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.510 
button and your lips and your raise and
lower<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> floor<00:01:38.759> button<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.400> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
lower the floor button so you have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
lower the floor button so you have
different<00:01:41.640> goals<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.420> try<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.659> complete<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
different goals to try to complete and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
different goals to try to complete and
if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> complete<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.640> these<00:01:44.759> goals

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if you complete all three of these goals

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.580 
if you complete all three of these goals
you'll<00:01:45.570> level<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.740> allows<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
you'll level up which allows you to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.130 
you'll level up which allows you to
basically<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:50.640> raise<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> effectiveness<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
basically to raise the effectiveness of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.520 
basically to raise the effectiveness of
these<00:01:52.290> different<00:01:52.799> items<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.520> buy<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
these different items you can buy so I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
these different items you can buy so I
kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> wish<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.310> leveling<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.390> raised

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
kind of wish that leveling up raised

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.060 
kind of wish that leveling up raised
your<00:01:58.500> real<00:01:58.770> stats<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.759> that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
your real stats or something like that

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
your real stats or something like that
instead<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:03.060> focusing<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
instead of just focusing on the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
instead of just focusing on the
power-ups<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> idea<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.430> they

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
power-ups because the idea is that they

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.059 
power-ups because the idea is that they
you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.659> Miniclip<00:02:07.200> wants<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.710> sell<00:02:07.890> you
