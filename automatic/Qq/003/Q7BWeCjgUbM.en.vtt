00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
totally unfair people who were just

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.530 
totally unfair people who were just
walking<00:02:16.310> around<00:02:16.430> looked<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:17.150> they<00:02:17.300> just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
walking around looked and then they just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
walking around looked and then they just
walked<00:02:17.780> off<00:02:17.959> nobody<00:02:18.440> had<00:02:18.560> helped<00:02:18.860> him<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.250> feel

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
walked off nobody had helped him I feel

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.729

really<00:02:19.819> sad<00:02:20.090> for<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.480> guy<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.900> then<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.290> think

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
really sad for this guy and then I think

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.710 
really sad for this guy and then I think
we<00:02:22.220> should<00:02:22.400> keep<00:02:22.580> every<00:02:22.940> traffic<00:02:23.150> policeman

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
we should keep every traffic policeman

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050 
we should keep every traffic policeman
or<00:02:24.140> every<00:02:24.440> cameras<00:02:24.890> active<00:02:25.340> at<00:02:25.430> every<00:02:25.670> places

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
or every cameras active at every places

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.580 
or every cameras active at every places
so<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.420> at<00:02:26.510> least<00:02:26.690> catch<00:02:26.930> every<00:02:27.260> signal

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
so we can at least catch every signal

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.559 
so we can at least catch every signal
people<00:02:27.950> at<00:02:28.430> least<00:02:28.640> catching<00:02:29.030> him<00:02:29.180> after<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569
