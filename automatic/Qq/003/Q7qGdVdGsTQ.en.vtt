00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and not dip into it too much um and I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
and not dip into it too much um and I
think<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.579> representation<00:00:45.180> here

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
think I have a good representation here

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
think I have a good representation here
of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> bush<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.250> matte

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
of the bush because I have one matte

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.529 
of the bush because I have one matte
shade<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.210> shimmer<00:00:48.539> shade<00:00:48.980> um<00:00:50.270> overall<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
shade in one shimmer shade um overall I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.150 
shade in one shimmer shade um overall I
think<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.960> shimmer<00:00:52.260> shades<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.039> bit

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
think the shimmer shades a little bit

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
think the shimmer shades a little bit
more<00:00:53.340> forgiving<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> little

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
more forgiving this can go on a little

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
more forgiving this can go on a little
bit<00:00:55.320> splotchy<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.129> somewhat<00:00:56.520> difficult

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
bit splotchy and be somewhat difficult

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.250 
bit splotchy and be somewhat difficult
to<00:00:57.180> blend<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.460> um<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to blend out but this one um it's a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
to blend out but this one um it's a
little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.859> forgiving<00:01:02.340> dealing<00:01:03.300> with

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
little bit more forgiving dealing with

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.789 
little bit more forgiving dealing with

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like the fact that they have the matte

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
like the fact that they have the matte
shades<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> women<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
shades because a lot of women I know you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.789 
shades because a lot of women I know you
do<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.860> using<00:01:38.310> shimmery<00:01:38.909> shades<00:01:39.299> um<00:01:39.799> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
do not like using shimmery shades um of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.550 
do not like using shimmery shades um of
the<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.390> prefer<00:01:42.540> tipsy<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the two I think I prefer tipsy just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
the two I think I prefer tipsy just
because<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.030> more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
because it to me it's a little bit more

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.410 
because it to me it's a little bit more
of<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> unique<00:01:45.720> color<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:47.009> color<00:01:47.090> has<00:01:48.090> been

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of a unique color this color has been

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
of a unique color this color has been
done<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.930> gazillion<00:01:49.409> times<00:01:49.860> before<00:01:50.460> even

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
done a gazillion times before even

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
done a gazillion times before even
though<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.689> beautiful<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.890> more

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
though it is beautiful and I think more

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
though it is beautiful and I think more
flattering<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.180> skin<00:01:54.450> tones<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:55.140> tipsy

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
flattering on more skin tones than tipsy

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.679 
flattering on more skin tones than tipsy
is<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.610> tipsy<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:58.020> unique<00:01:58.469> color

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
is I think tipsy is a more unique color

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
is I think tipsy is a more unique color
um<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.899> far<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.770> their<00:02:01.920> staying<00:02:02.159> power<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:03.060> do

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
um as far as their staying power they do

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.740 
um as far as their staying power they do
last<00:02:03.930> longer<00:02:04.890> than<00:02:04.920> most<00:02:05.549> other<00:02:05.880> blushes<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
last longer than most other blushes I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.300 
last longer than most other blushes I
have<00:02:06.930> dealt
