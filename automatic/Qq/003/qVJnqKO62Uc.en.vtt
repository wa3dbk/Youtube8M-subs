is<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.870> important<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.710> mix<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
is when it's important to mix it if I

salad<00:01:55.440> right<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.220> would<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.370> okay<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.030> if

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
salad right now it would be okay but if

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.210
