00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
habits and bad habits now the cardinal

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.460 
habits and bad habits now the cardinal
grand<00:01:43.850> cross<00:01:43.970> that<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:44.540> have<00:01:44.750> work<00:01:45.440> that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
grand cross that we have work that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.220 
grand cross that we have work that
working<00:01:46.370> working<00:01:46.760> its<00:01:47.120> way<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> being<00:01:47.750> exact

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
working working its way to being exact

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.340 
working working its way to being exact
over<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.650> next<00:01:48.920> few<00:01:49.070> weeks<00:01:49.370> few<00:01:49.670> months<00:01:50.030> is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
over the next few weeks few months is

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.760 
over the next few weeks few months is
also<00:01:52.030> opportunities<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.530> say<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
also opportunities and I say that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.370 
also opportunities and I say that
because<00:01:55.130> squares<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:55.820> challenges<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.840> less

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
because squares are challenges and less

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.410 
because squares are challenges and less
sounds<00:01:57.680> are<00:01:57.800> counterintuitive<00:01:58.100> but<00:01:58.760> squares

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
sounds are counterintuitive but squares

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.800 
sounds are counterintuitive but squares
of<00:01:59.630> challenges<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.470> obstacles<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.150> when<00:02:02.690> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
of challenges and obstacles and when we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.810 
of challenges and obstacles and when we
meet<00:02:03.050> challenges<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.740> obstacles<00:02:03.860> they<00:02:04.400> equal

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
meet challenges and obstacles they equal

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.090 
meet challenges and obstacles they equal
opportunities<00:02:05.540> they<00:02:05.810> become<00:02:06.170> opportunities

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
opportunities they become opportunities

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.180 
opportunities they become opportunities
