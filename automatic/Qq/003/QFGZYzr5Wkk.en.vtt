 for this we fry onions 1 onion and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.260
 one carrot in vegetable oil and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 put out such here we have onions and carrots 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 roasted but they have to very well 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 under the ring but not fry then we 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's approach a little bit of water and constant 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 processes with two 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.670
 and now I have everything ready smile 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.300
 soft 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.920
 I cut the fried liver 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 now i will pro to scroll through 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 meat grinder 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.430
 first an ordinary lattice and then 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.780
 that's so petty very respectable 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 called grille 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 it will work twice I won't tell you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.000
 show how much I need to spin 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.820
 buzzing and everyone knows how a meat grinder works 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.580
 and see 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 us as beautifully rolled because 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.360
 this is on the venerable lattice that we are next 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 do we add who likes of course not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.259
 everyone needs to add nutmeg 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.170
 see how well where the floor of tea 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.330
 spoons and now on an amateur 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.579
 You can add salted bacon here of course 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.380
 scrolled and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:37.400
 or butter or a little bit like me 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.400
 add plum 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.980
 need more for taste scroll when you 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.600
 twist 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.910
 liver is a sweet and sour apple one 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 she also gives a peculiar taste 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.760
 Well, I just did not have home 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.890
 an apple will make an apple into an apple 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.890
 since well, so you know that you can 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.960
 use this is also very tasty here 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.340
 this bag we have obtained, we 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.520
 try salt more perch and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.550
 but if you poured the liver and vegetables onions and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.950
 add nothing to the carrot tone 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.220
 ready to apply with us almost on 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.220
 Bon appetit and good luck to you
