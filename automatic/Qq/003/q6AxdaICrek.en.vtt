00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.140 
blinkers on our LED on the front you
notice<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.340> actually<00:00:08.460> does<00:00:08.790> look<00:00:08.880> like<00:00:09.000> it's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
notice it actually does look like it's

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.650 
notice it actually does look like it's
flashing<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> backside<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:12.420> barely

relay<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> easier<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.910> not

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
relay it's one of the easier it's not

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
relay it's one of the easier it's not
exactly<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> easiest<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.220> resistors<00:00:26.220> are

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
exactly the easiest the resistors are

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
exactly the easiest the resistors are
easier<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> relay<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.779> makes<00:00:27.930> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
easier but you get a relay it makes it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080 
easier but you get a relay it makes it

actually<00:03:21.620> white<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.940> green<00:03:23.180> stripe<00:03:24.190> let

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
actually white with a green stripe let

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.110 
actually white with a green stripe let
me<00:03:25.310> show<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.549> here<00:03:26.440> white<00:03:27.440> wire<00:03:27.970> those<00:03:28.970> two

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
me show you here white wire those two

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.020 
me show you here white wire those two
locking<00:03:29.360> pins<00:03:30.100> I'll<00:03:31.100> just<00:03:31.310> take<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.640> lock

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
locking pins I'll just take the lock

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.699 
locking pins I'll just take the lock
them<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.299> so<00:03:32.660> much<00:03:32.750> like<00:03:32.989> Talib's<00:03:33.380> locking<00:03:33.650> as

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
them in so much like Talib's locking as

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.440 
them in so much like Talib's locking as
a<00:03:33.799> wire<00:03:33.980> harness<00:03:34.130> put<00:03:34.940> electrical<00:03:35.330> tape

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
a wire harness put electrical tape

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.560 
a wire harness put electrical tape
around<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:36.220> mean<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.730> locking<00:03:38.390> pin

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
around I mean if a locking pin

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.759 
around I mean if a locking pin
connection<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.019> good<00:03:39.170> enough<00:03:39.380> for<00:03:39.440> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
connection is good enough for the

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.280 
connection is good enough for the
manufacturer<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.459> good<00:03:40.610> enough<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:40.850> me<00:03:41.290> all

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
manufacturer it's good enough for me all

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.320 
manufacturer it's good enough for me all
I<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.590> do<00:03:42.709> after<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.160> actually<00:03:44.000> cut

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
I have to do after that is actually cut

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.660 
I have to do after that is actually cut

back<00:04:36.970> together<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.360> reverse<00:04:37.750> process<00:04:38.050> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
back together in reverse process the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.810 
back together in reverse process the
hardest<00:04:38.650> part<00:04:38.800> about<00:04:38.830> putting<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.280> back<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.610> is

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
hardest part about putting it back in is

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.210 
hardest part about putting it back in is
getting<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.660> two<00:04:40.900> tabs<00:04:41.230> underneath<00:04:41.890> your

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
getting you two tabs underneath your

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.090 
getting you two tabs underneath your
tank<00:04:42.460> from<00:04:42.820> that<00:04:43.060> molding<00:04:43.750> here<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.200> mean<00:04:44.710> it's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
tank from that molding here I mean it's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.220 
tank from that molding here I mean it's
just<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.370> matter<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.670> bending<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.900> reach

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
just a matter of bending it to reach

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.470 
just a matter of bending it to reach
that<00:04:47.620> tab<00:04:48.010> that<00:04:48.250> was<00:04:48.400> up<00:04:48.640> back<00:04:49.000> up<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.300> here
