by<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.390> bought<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.870> target<00:00:43.260> for

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
by out and I bought this a target for

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.840 
by out and I bought this a target for
only<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> dollar<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> thought<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.670> really

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
only a dollar which I thought was really

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
only a dollar which I thought was really
reasonable<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> reason<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> bought<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
reasonable and the reason I bought this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
reasonable and the reason I bought this
is<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> read<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.570> reviews<00:00:48.719> online

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is because I read some reviews online

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.690 
is because I read some reviews online
saying<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> good<00:00:50.160> product<00:00:50.489> for

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
saying that it was a good product for

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360 
saying that it was a good product for
its<00:00:50.969> price<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> went<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.160> I'm

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
its price so I went and got it but I'm

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.720 
its price so I went and got it but I'm
really<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.149> disappointed<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.020> um

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
really really disappointed in this um

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
really really disappointed in this um
the<00:00:56.730> only<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.750> say<00:00:57.870> about

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the only good thing that I can say about

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.439 
the only good thing that I can say about
it<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.859> guess<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.520> smells<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.090> candy

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

I don't know if that's like good or bad
it<00:01:03.000> depends<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> person<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.110> guess<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.559> um

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it depends on the person I guess but um

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
it depends on the person I guess but um
basically<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.210> doesn't<00:01:06.570> cover<00:01:06.780> anything<00:01:06.990> at

I was using it as a concealer until I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
I was using it as a concealer until I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
um so yeah basically this is kind of a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.440 
um so yeah basically this is kind of a

um you you know click right here and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.900 
um you you know click right here and
then

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
then

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.070 
then
you<00:02:10.120> twist<00:02:10.390> right<00:02:10.510> here<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.870> then<00:02:10.960> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
you twist right here and then the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.780 
you twist right here and then the
product<00:02:11.500> dispenses<00:02:12.010> from<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> brush<00:02:12.550> side

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
product dispenses from the brush side

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.500 
product dispenses from the brush side
right<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.540> um<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:15.820> like<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
right here and um I do like this as a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
right here and um I do like this as a
highlighter<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.080> guess<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> little

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
highlighter I guess but it is a little

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.580 
highlighter I guess but it is a little
bit<00:02:18.250> chunky<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.940> texture<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.690> when<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.410> comes

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
bit chunky and texture and when it comes

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.910 
bit chunky and texture and when it comes
out<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> brush<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.990> have<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.440> kind<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.770> be

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
out of the brush you have to kind of be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.410 
out of the brush you have to kind of be
careful<00:02:24.100> because<00:02:24.430> when<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.820> brush<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.060> this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
careful because when you brush it this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.910 
careful because when you brush it this
way<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.080> product<00:02:26.410> comes<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.890> other

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
way like the product comes out the other

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.550 
way like the product comes out the other
way<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.510> really<00:02:28.690> odd<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.200> basically

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
way so it's really odd but basically

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.670 
way so it's really odd but basically
it's<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> second<00:02:30.340> color<00:02:30.550> right<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:30.820> um<00:02:31.780> this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it's the second color right here um this

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's the second color right here um this
won't<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> second<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.640> light<00:02:33.850> lightest

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
won't like the second to light lightest

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
won't like the second to light lightest
color<00:02:34.840> there<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.380> no<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.830> number<00:02:36.220> or<00:02:36.460> color

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
color there is no like number or color

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.240 
color there is no like number or color
on<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.080> don't<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.650> i'll<00:02:38.800> link<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> if

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
on here so I don't know i'll link it if

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.480 
on here so I don't know i'll link it if
i<00:02:39.370> find<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.510> basically<00:02:40.720> um<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:42.340> was

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
i find it but basically um this was

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.310 
i find it but basically um this was
probably<00:02:42.730> good<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.420> highlighter<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:44.110> as<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
probably good as a highlighter not as a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.520 
probably good as a highlighter not as a
concealer<00:02:44.820> um<00:02:45.820> ok<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.990> third<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:47.410> I'm

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
concealer um ok so the third one I'm

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.590 
concealer um ok so the third one I'm
going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.740> talk<00:02:47.920> about<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.400> max<00:02:48.970> select

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
going to talk about is max select

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.570 
going to talk about is max select
moisture<00:02:50.170> cover<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.040> don't<00:02:51.250> know<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.460> they

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
moisture cover and I don't know if they

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.980 
moisture cover and I don't know if they
have<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.940> anymore<00:02:52.300> because<00:02:52.450> I've<00:02:52.720> never

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
have this anymore because I've never

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.960 
have this anymore because I've never
like<00:02:53.710> I've<00:02:53.950> never<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.520> bought<00:02:54.700> anything

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
like I've never really bought anything

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.760 
like I've never really bought anything
at<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.210> mac<00:02:55.420> store<00:02:55.660> before<00:02:55.870> except<00:02:56.650> for

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
at a mac store before except for

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.270 
at a mac store before except for
eyeliner<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.240> reason<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.020> is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
eyeliner and the reason I have this is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.350 
eyeliner and the reason I have this is
better<00:03:01.290> ok<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.370> reason<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.150> is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
better ok so the reason I have this is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.300 
better ok so the reason I have this is
because<00:03:04.720> my<00:03:04.960> mom<00:03:05.200> gave<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.650> me<00:03:05.800> because<00:03:06.100> she

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
because my mom gave it to me because she

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.190 
because my mom gave it to me because she
doesn't<00:03:06.670> use<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.570> too<00:03:07.690> dark<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:07.960> her

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
doesn't use it and it's too dark for her

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.290 
doesn't use it and it's too dark for her
so<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.220> actually<00:03:09.370> turned<00:03:09.790> out<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:10.120> way

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
so this actually turned out to be way

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.150 
so this actually turned out to be way
too<00:03:10.360> dark<00:03:10.600> for<00:03:10.720> me<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.410> like<00:03:11.800> super

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
too dark for me to it's just like super

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.400 
too dark for me to it's just like super
dark<00:03:12.430> color<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> middle<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:14.230> one

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
dark color right in the middle this one

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.390 
dark color right in the middle this one
yeah<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.459> um<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.240> do<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.590> consistency<00:03:17.830> of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
yeah so um I do like the consistency of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
yeah so um I do like the consistency of
this<00:03:18.640> like<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.060> texture<00:03:19.390> nice<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.900> glides<00:03:20.170> on

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
this like the texture nice it glides on

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.280 
this like the texture nice it glides on
pretty<00:03:20.530> smooth<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.580> um<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.240> it's<00:03:22.600> pretty

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
pretty smooth but um it's it's pretty

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.540 
pretty smooth but um it's it's pretty
much<00:03:23.380> too<00:03:23.860> dark<00:03:24.250> for<00:03:24.490> my<00:03:25.260> skin<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.560> like<00:03:27.040> when

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
much too dark for my skin and like when

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.830 
much too dark for my skin and like when
I<00:03:27.580> put<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.060> comes<00:03:28.360> on<00:03:28.450> kind<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.750> like
