00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.930
 welcome to the applied today I'm going to 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.650
 tell you how a braid is made 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.290
 Tang but I will do to let 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.509
 so that you know how to do the whole world 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.940
 step by step and not as in the videos that 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.190
 I could see that they start doing it and 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.020
 they take for granted many steps that 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.480
 really really clear then it is 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 for basic basic basic because I'm going to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.290
 make very slow so that everyone 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.810
 so that he is excited to learn 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.540
 do the a-30 ear, then have the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.960
 opportunity to do it in the end is 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.890
 question of practice and after patience 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.190
 Well first of all they separate or not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.650
 we brush the hair whatever is dry 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.150
 We can put a little serum if 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.030
 we want the braid to stay 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.119
 more stuck but I liked it more 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.650
 Do not do it, do not do it, do not do it 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 I have nothing to catch them 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.030
 it's just dry dry 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.080
 then we put it aside 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.990
 here we separate 2 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 the pieces 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 of hair 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.720
 that you can see it perfectly and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.940
 then here comes the key to the matter 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.710
 look good 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.840
 you have to separate once with the index 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:48.470
 this crime and we went through the part of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.750
 behind one of the sides you take a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.750
 little bit of quantity and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 with your thumb you pass it to the other half 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.270
 of hair is worth this is a movement 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 we isolate what we comb and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.630
 the same movement the index we take a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.920
 little piece of hair 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.230
 and with the thumb we had the time 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.340
 ahead until the other mention of 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.020
 hair to see the movement this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.510
 principle is the most complicated to the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.510
 principle what yes 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.390
 we can do it to practice and I 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.610
 I recommend for trucks served is 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.220
 put a bomb or make a tail 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.430
 real here and we're working on that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.989
 but good if not because it's a matter of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.300
 do it at home to the practitioner while 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.340
 watch TV and until one day 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.910
 goes well I do not know I 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.959
 learned and so we are good we continue 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:11.650
 index index we take from the part of 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:16.090
 behind a piece of hair and with the thumb 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:21.370
 we take it to the other half 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.360
 of hair is equal for here index a 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.360
 little piece of hair 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:34.560
 and we passed it with the thumb towards the other 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.620
 hair side at the end is the game of 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.860
 practice what I want you to see is 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.920
 how the game is made because in the end it is 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.819
 that's what the braid is going to be 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.630
 index 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.100
 behind 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.319
 peel 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.590
 and we had it 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.620
 a darling now I have to finish it 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.890
 millions 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.160
 A) Yes 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.460
 index 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.950
 and we started 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:11.290
 and we are doing it like that 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.770
 and we are doing that hand that you see is 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:20.519
 my husband 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:22.800
 if today we are all three and cooking 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.540
 because you know that my husband 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.680
 I like to cook I have this great luck 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.680
 and while it is activated 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.610
 I'm here doing 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.890
 let's go doing let's doing 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.910
 Y 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.199
 the diet always the same and tires then 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.610
 well hey this is an option for both 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.949
 now the summer for 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.460
 we have heat the hair to go to the 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.000
 beach to go to work 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.780
 Y 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.990
 It is a braid 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.290
 different 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.440
 and looks it worked and I say that 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.770
 if you want it if you want it for a 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.770
 wedding 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.980
 then we would put a little bit 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.460
 of light 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.460
 d 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.680
 from zero 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.680
 and then it would be like more 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.360
 you can see it 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:06.830
 and how is it left if we had zero 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.259
 we would have it much more fixed since it is 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.860
 this is the end of the braid then 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.659
 with a finite rubber of these little ones 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.360
 that is not this but already right now 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.360
 I have another one because we help 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.960
 we really help better than what a 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.629
 finite of her for this case and I 'm not going to 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.030
 come out with this but if you do not hear no 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:33.090
 have gummies and do not want to spend them 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.889
 spend the money on buying the solution 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.400
 practice 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.400
 we take hair 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.500
 to go 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.790
 we hide 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.790
 we are hiding 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.669
 we hide 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.380
 and artist 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:03.160
 from behind and we already have it good because 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.650
 you have seen that it is very simple to make yourself 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.670
 a different braid then we could 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:13.080
 open if you feel like more and give it a look 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:17.050
 more carefree take out hairs to do it 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.660
 a little more and more casual 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.390
 that I like more 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:27.080
 Make up is a little bit more than me 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.680
 scheme today today at home and then 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.200
 I hope you liked my way 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.260
 easy and honestly quick to do the 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.360
 braid and this has been my look 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.250
 today I hope you like it and if someone 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.980
 have any suggestions for a hairstyle 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:46.190
 I do not know how to do it because I love you 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.240
 I always do it in the easiest way 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.240
 until the next
