digital to analog converter or DAC like

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
digital to analog converter or DAC like
this<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this one here this is going to take that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.999 
this one here this is going to take that
pure<00:01:36.180> digital<00:01:36.689> signal<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.560> computer

pure digital signal from your computer

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
pure digital signal from your computer
so<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> bypass<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.720> sound<00:01:39.990> card

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so it's going to bypass the sound card

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
so it's going to bypass the sound card
and<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> processing<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.340> goes<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and all the processing that goes on in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.240 
and all the processing that goes on in
your<00:01:42.150> computer<00:01:42.630> it'll<00:01:43.350> process<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> sound

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
your computer it'll process the sound

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.149 
your computer it'll process the sound
with<00:01:44.729> its<00:01:45.030> dedicated<00:01:45.780> digital<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.770> analog

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
with its dedicated digital to analog

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
with its dedicated digital to analog
converter<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> give<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
converter and so it's going to give you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
converter and so it's going to give you
a<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.560> high<00:01:49.799> quality<00:01:49.860> sound<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.030> it'll

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
a really high quality sound that it'll
