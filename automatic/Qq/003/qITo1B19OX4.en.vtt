situation you could get let's say just a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.789 
situation you could get let's say just a
simple<00:01:40.979> thing<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.369> cut<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.909> your<00:01:42.180> hand<00:01:42.420> and

simple thing as a cut on your hand and
that<00:01:43.799> could<00:01:43.979> lead<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> infection<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.970> bacterial

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that could lead to infection a bacterial

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
that could lead to infection a bacterial
infection<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.490> something<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.880> could

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
infection and something like that could

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.639 
infection and something like that could
could<00:01:48.570> eventually<00:01:48.840> kill<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
could eventually kill you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
could eventually kill you
in<00:01:49.979> fact<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> won't<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:50.729> long<00:01:51.200> for

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in fact it won't take very long for

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
in fact it won't take very long for
something<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> poison<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.610> body

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something like that to poison your body

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.819 
something like that to poison your body
and<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.600> give<00:01:54.750> serious<00:01:55.020> enough<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and to give serious enough and if you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
and to give serious enough and if you
don't<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.130> treatment<00:01:56.460> immediately<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.719> will

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
don't get treatment immediately you will

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.609 
don't get treatment immediately you will
die<00:01:58.110> from<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> simple<00:01:59.310> thing<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> cut

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
die from just the simple thing as a cut

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.300 
die from just the simple thing as a cut
so<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.969> prepper<00:02:03.469> to<00:02:04.469> combat

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so what do you do as a prepper to combat

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
so what do you do as a prepper to combat
such<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> situation<00:02:06.360> obviously<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.110> can't

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
such a situation obviously you can't

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.680 
such a situation obviously you can't
think<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> everything

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
think of everything

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.140 
think of everything
for<00:02:09.690> something<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:11.060> pneumonia

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
for something like pneumonia

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.000 
for something like pneumonia
you<00:02:13.960> know<00:02:14.080> or<00:02:14.260> any<00:02:14.410> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.650> bacterial

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you know or any kind of bacterial

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.160 
you know or any kind of bacterial
infection<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.490> need<00:02:15.670> antibiotics<00:02:16.330> but

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
infection you need antibiotics but

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.860 
infection you need antibiotics but
antibiotics<00:02:18.130> are<00:02:18.400> not<00:02:18.630> something<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
antibiotics are not something that you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.260 
antibiotics are not something that you
can<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.020> go<00:02:20.260> buy<00:02:20.440> off<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.650> shelf<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
can just go buy off the shelf and this

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.620 
can just go buy off the shelf and this
is<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.750> controversial<00:02:23.290> topic<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
is kind of a controversial topic as to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.830 
is kind of a controversial topic as to
where<00:02:25.900> people<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.410> antibiotics<00:02:26.710> for<00:02:27.840> shtf

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
where people get antibiotics for shtf

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.820 
where people get antibiotics for shtf
type<00:02:29.170> scenario<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:31.720> you've<00:02:32.020> done<00:02:32.680> some

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
type of antibiotic a lot of it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.390 
type of antibiotic a lot of it
there's<00:05:50.500> a<00:05:50.560> lot<00:05:50.770> of<00:05:50.920> different<00:05:51.190> antibiotics

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
there's a lot of different antibiotics

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.100 
there's a lot of different antibiotics
obviously<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.300> they're<00:05:52.570> all<00:05:52.720> kind<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:52.990> do

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
obviously and they're all kind of do

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.840 
obviously and they're all kind of do
different<00:05:53.530> things<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.980> there's<00:05:54.640> different

different things and there's different

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.800 
different things and there's different
ways<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.480> antibiotics<00:05:56.110> contact<00:05:56.620> bacteria

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
ways that antibiotics contact bacteria

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.920 
ways that antibiotics contact bacteria
the<00:05:58.810> two<00:05:59.020> most<00:05:59.920> common<00:06:00.370> ways<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:00.930> some

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
the two most common ways is some

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.080 
the two most common ways is some
antibiotics<00:06:02.560> will<00:06:03.160> actively<00:06:03.520> try<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.820> kill

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
antibiotics will actively try to kill

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.900 
antibiotics will actively try to kill
the<00:06:04.210> bacteria<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:05.590> other<00:06:05.950> ones<00:06:06.250> will<00:06:06.610> prevent

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
the bacteria and other ones will prevent

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.980 
the bacteria and other ones will prevent
the<00:06:07.090> bacteria<00:06:07.270> from<00:06:07.570> multiplying<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:09.490> that

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
the bacteria from multiplying so that

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.570 
the bacteria from multiplying so that
eventually<00:06:10.990> kind<00:06:11.500> of<00:06:11.620> just<00:06:11.800> dies<00:06:11.980> itself<00:06:12.400> out

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
eventually kind of just dies itself out

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.790 
eventually kind of just dies itself out
so<00:06:13.350> if<00:06:14.350> you<00:06:14.500> don't<00:06:14.710> know<00:06:15.030> about<00:06:16.590> how<00:06:17.590> these

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
so if you don't know about how these

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.830 
so if you don't know about how these
medicines<00:06:18.340> work<00:06:18.550> or<00:06:18.880> how<00:06:19.090> your<00:06:19.300> body<00:06:19.600> will

medicines work or how your body will

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.600 
medicines work or how your body will
react<00:06:20.200> to<00:06:20.230> these<00:06:20.500> medicines<00:06:20.800> or<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.340> side

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
effects you need to have some kind of

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.660
