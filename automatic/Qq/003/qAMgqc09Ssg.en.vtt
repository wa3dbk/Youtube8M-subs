telling<00:00:51.539> us<00:00:51.660> okay<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> building<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
telling us okay this building is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
telling us okay this building is
Renaissance<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> medieval<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
Renaissance this one is medieval and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.700 
Renaissance this one is medieval and
this<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.820> built<00:00:57.149> only<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:58.050> 100<00:00:58.500> years

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this one was built only like 100 years

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
this one was built only like 100 years
ago<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:00.780> research

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
ago so we could really in our research

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
ago so we could really in our research
due<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> difference<00:01:02.489> between<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
due to the difference between the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
due to the difference between the
architecture<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.350> doing<00:01:05.159> our<00:01:05.309> research

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
architecture and then doing our research

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
architecture and then doing our research
we<00:01:05.939> could<00:01:06.150> also<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.659> okay<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> building<00:01:07.619> was

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we could also say okay this building was

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.780 
we could also say okay this building was
not<00:01:08.130> exactly<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.369> take<00:01:11.640> an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not exactly like it is now if I take an

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.050 
not exactly like it is now if I take an
example<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.689> facade<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> Duomo

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
in Florence wasn't billed at the time

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080 
in Florence wasn't billed at the time
and<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> fact<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.460> if

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and and the fact that you can see now if

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
and and the fact that you can see now if
you<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> 19th<00:01:23.340> century

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
rules a little bit about that to make

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
rules a little bit about that to make
you<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:34.860> looks<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:36.180> as

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

structure<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:54.620> totally<00:04:55.400> different<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.120> we

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
structure is totally different so we

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.710 
structure is totally different so we
without<00:04:57.140> this<00:04:57.380> like<00:04:57.620> structure<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.430> would<00:04:58.720> a

without this like structure that would a

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.970 
without this like structure that would a
little<00:05:00.500> bit<00:05:01.030> constraint<00:05:02.030> us<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.600> in<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:03.650> way<00:05:03.830> of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
little bit constraint us in in a way of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.610 
little bit constraint us in in a way of
doing<00:05:04.100> mission<00:05:04.610> without<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:05.120> constraint<00:05:05.660> we

doing mission without this constraint we

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.000 
doing mission without this constraint we
can<00:05:06.920> make<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.400> like<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:08.170> much<00:05:09.170> more<00:05:09.530> unique

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
can make it like it much more unique

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.910 
can make it like it much more unique
each<00:05:10.250> time<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.700> play<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:10.910> mission<00:05:11.530> thus<00:05:12.530> having
