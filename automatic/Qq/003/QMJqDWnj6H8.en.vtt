videos and the topic for the day is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.560 
videos and the topic for the day is
limitations<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.400> how<00:00:29.910> would<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.270> increase

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
limitations are how would you increase

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.140 
limitations are how would you increase
the<00:00:31.020> power<00:00:31.199> output<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.040> diesel<00:00:32.430> engine<00:00:32.970> that

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
the power output of a diesel engine that

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.140 
the power output of a diesel engine that
is<00:00:33.449> a<00:00:33.629> marine<00:00:33.960> diesel<00:00:34.140> engine<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> by<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
is a marine diesel engine so by this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.390 
is a marine diesel engine so by this
time<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.780> know<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.470> formula<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
time we all know about the formula the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.170 
time we all know about the formula the
indicated<00:00:39.239> power<00:00:39.480> versus<00:00:40.019> IP<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.890> P<00:00:41.400> times<00:00:41.760> L

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
indicated power versus IP is P times L

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.310 
indicated power versus IP is P times L
times<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.050> times<00:00:43.649> M<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.370> planned<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:46.020> not

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
times a times M as planned so I'm not

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
times a times M as planned so I'm not
going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.829> include<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.579> conversion<00:00:48.149> factors

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
going to include the conversion factors

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.470 
going to include the conversion factors
from<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.379> unit<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.760> P<00:00:50.969> stands<00:00:51.329> for

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
from one unit to other so P stands for

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.950 
from one unit to other so P stands for
this<00:00:51.899> main<00:00:52.500> indicated<00:00:53.430> pressure<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.840> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
this main indicated pressure I got to be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
this main indicated pressure I got to be
more<00:00:55.170> clear<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.980> respect<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> power<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
more clear with respect to the power it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.170 
more clear with respect to the power it
has<00:00:57.719> mean<00:00:58.079> indicated<00:00:59.039> pressure<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.879> mean

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
liner not the area of the piston it is

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.850 
liner not the area of the piston it is
the<00:01:08.310> area<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.940> liner<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.660> M<00:01:09.990> depends<00:01:10.710> on

the area of the liner and M depends on

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.130 
the area of the liner and M depends on
whether<00:01:11.039> it's<00:01:11.160> two-stroke<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.970> four-stroke

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
whether it's two-stroke or four-stroke

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.780 
whether it's two-stroke or four-stroke
the<00:01:13.140> number<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> strokes<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.190> RPM<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the number of strokes or the RPM of the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.620 
the number of strokes or the RPM of the
engine<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> formula<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.390> power

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
engine so with this formula the power

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
engine so with this formula the power
can<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.080> increased<00:01:19.619> by<00:01:19.920> wailing<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.880> these

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
can be increased by wailing all these

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
can be increased by wailing all these
factors<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> fact<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:23.220> write<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.790> power

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
factors in fact I can write it as power

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.039 
factors in fact I can write it as power
is<00:01:24.450> directly<00:01:24.869> proportional<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> P<00:01:26.070> L<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.880> M<00:01:27.049> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is directly proportional to P L and M so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.160 
is directly proportional to P L and M so
by<00:01:28.530> increasing<00:01:29.159> any<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.479> factor<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
by increasing any one of this factor I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
by increasing any one of this factor I
can<00:01:31.470> increase<00:01:31.710> power<00:01:32.090> let's<00:01:33.090> take<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> RPM

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
can increase power let's take the RPM

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.070 
can increase power let's take the RPM
speed<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.830> engine<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.540> increase<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
speed of the engine so if I increase the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960 
speed of the engine so if I increase the
speed<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> engine<00:01:37.830> obviously<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> power

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
speed of the engine obviously the power

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
speed of the engine obviously the power
develop<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.960> increase<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> marine

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
develop will increase but for a marine

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080 
develop will increase but for a marine
diesel<00:01:42.509> engine<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.439> maximum<00:01:44.070> rpm<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> going

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
diesel engine the maximum rpm is going

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
diesel engine the maximum rpm is going
to<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> saved<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.259> can't<00:01:46.530> extend<00:01:47.009> beyond<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
to be saved we can't extend beyond that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.990 
to be saved we can't extend beyond that
so<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> design<00:01:48.780> criteria<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> endless

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so that's the design criteria so endless

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.740 
so that's the design criteria so endless
not<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> factor<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.549> if<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.299> about<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
not the factor and if I think about the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.050 
not the factor and if I think about the
other<00:01:54.960> factors<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.920> let's<00:01:56.820> say<00:01:57.380> area<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
other factors like let's say area and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600 
other factors like let's say area and
Strickland<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> particular<00:02:02.250> design

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
Strickland for a particular design

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
Strickland for a particular design
engine<00:02:03.180> let's<00:02:03.420> say<00:02:03.630> 6<00:02:04.439> s<00:02:04.649> 70<00:02:05.159> M<00:02:05.430> C<00:02:06.229> number<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
engine let's say 6 s 70 M C number of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.870 
engine let's say 6 s 70 M C number of
units<00:02:07.740> six<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> 17<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.410> 700<00:02:10.410> mm<00:02:10.829> of<00:02:11.009> the

units six and 17 that is 700 mm of the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120 
units six and 17 that is 700 mm of the
cylinder<00:02:12.209> diameter<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.260> altered<00:02:13.500> for<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
cylinder diameter can be altered for a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.000 
cylinder diameter can be altered for a
particular<00:02:14.700> engine<00:02:15.120> design<00:02:15.540> however<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
particular engine design however the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.360 
particular engine design however the
only<00:02:17.250> parameter<00:02:18.090> which<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.599> alter<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.379> P

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
only parameter which I can alter is P

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.320 
only parameter which I can alter is P
that<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.760> mean<00:02:21.480> indicated<00:02:22.349> pressure

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that is mean indicated pressure

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.950 
that is mean indicated pressure
sooo<00:02:24.160> main<00:02:25.160> indicator<00:02:25.640> pressure<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:27.100> if<00:02:28.100> I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
sooo main indicator pressure like if I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.510 
sooo main indicator pressure like if I
let's<00:02:29.960> say<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.260> I'm<00:02:30.530> going<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.860> put<00:02:31.040> more<00:02:31.250> fuel

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
let's say if I'm going to put more fuel

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340 
let's say if I'm going to put more fuel
I'm<00:02:31.850> going<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.660> get<00:02:32.780> more<00:02:32.990> power

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
I'm going to get more power

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.220 
I'm going to get more power
that's<00:02:33.620> very<00:02:34.070> simple<00:02:34.400> however<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.780> burn<00:02:35.990> more

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that's very simple however to burn more

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.910 
that's very simple however to burn more
fuel<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.830> need<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.400> put<00:02:37.610> more<00:02:37.850> air<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> that's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
fuel I need to put more air so that's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.300 
fuel I need to put more air so that's
one<00:02:40.640> factor<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.620> increase<00:02:42.620> engine<00:02:42.860> speed

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
one factor and increase engine speed

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.670 
one factor and increase engine speed
this<00:02:43.490> is<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> design<00:02:44.090> thing<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.960> cannot<00:02:45.290> do

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
this is the design thing so we cannot do

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.850 
this is the design thing so we cannot do
this<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.070> various<00:02:47.030> friction<00:02:47.740> obviously<00:02:48.740> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this and various friction obviously the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.970 
this and various friction obviously the
tribology<00:02:49.310> or<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.470> characteristics<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.620> lube

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
tribology or the characteristics of lube

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.880 
tribology or the characteristics of lube
oil<00:02:52.190> has<00:02:52.490> been<00:02:52.780> improved<00:02:53.780> over<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.140> decade<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
oil has been improved over a decade so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.670 
oil has been improved over a decade so
the<00:02:55.340> coefficient<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.270> friction<00:02:56.840> keeps<00:02:57.440> on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the coefficient of friction keeps on

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.860 
the coefficient of friction keeps on
reducing<00:02:57.920> as<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.580> lube<00:02:58.730> oil<00:02:58.970> characteristics

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
reducing as the lube oil characteristics

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.960 
reducing as the lube oil characteristics
and<00:03:00.050> bearing<00:03:00.410> metal<00:03:00.970> characteristics

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and bearing metal characteristics

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.350 
and bearing metal characteristics
increase<00:03:02.480> or<00:03:02.750> improve<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:04.100> friction<00:03:04.700> drops

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
increase or improve so friction drops

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.410 
increase or improve so friction drops
and<00:03:05.660> if<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.740> friction<00:03:06.980> drops<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.940> friction

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and if the friction drops the friction

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.720 
and if the friction drops the friction
coefficient<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.290> friction<00:03:09.770> losses<00:03:10.040> come<00:03:10.490> down

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
coefficient of friction losses come down

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.030 
coefficient of friction losses come down
and<00:03:11.000> thus<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.900> increases<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.709> efficiency

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and thus that increases the efficiency

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.760 
and thus that increases the efficiency
of<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.730> engine<00:03:14.260> increase<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.440> compression

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
of the engine increase the compression

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.960 
of the engine increase the compression
ratio<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.480> we're<00:03:18.350> going<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.770> deal<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:19.580> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
ratio so we're going to deal with the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.760 
ratio so we're going to deal with the
compression<00:03:20.510> ratio<00:03:20.690> in<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.080> separate<00:03:21.530> video

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
compression ratio in a separate video

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.430 
compression ratio in a separate video
however<00:03:22.580> increasing<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.690> compression<00:03:24.230> ratio

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
however increasing the compression ratio

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.130 
however increasing the compression ratio
of<00:03:24.860> an<00:03:25.160> engine<00:03:25.520> will<00:03:25.880> definitely<00:03:26.510> improve<00:03:26.930> its

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
of an engine will definitely improve its

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.070 
of an engine will definitely improve its
power<00:03:27.470> output<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.940> last<00:03:29.150> one<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.570> area

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
power output and the last one is area

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.280 
power output and the last one is area
increase<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.250> weight<00:03:31.430> like<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.080> same

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
increase in weight like for the same

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.900 
increase in weight like for the same
engine<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.800> can<00:03:33.980> produce<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.489> weight<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:34.820> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
engine I can produce the weight of the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.060 
engine I can produce the weight of the
piston<00:03:35.090> or<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.570> cylinder<00:03:36.019> liner<00:03:36.410> across<00:03:36.890> an

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
piston or the cylinder liner across an

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.710 
piston or the cylinder liner across an
arrangement<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:37.820> as<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.540> weight<00:03:38.690> comes

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
arrangement so that as the weight comes

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.050 
arrangement so that as the weight comes
down<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.709> power<00:03:39.980> output<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.820> same

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
down the power output for the same

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.080 
down the power output for the same
engine<00:03:41.600> with<00:03:41.800> same<00:03:42.800> dimensions<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
engine with same dimensions is going to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.330 
engine with same dimensions is going to
increase<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:46.450> out<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.230> factors<00:03:48.680> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
increase so out of all the factors the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.300 
increase so out of all the factors the
one<00:03:49.550> which<00:03:49.790> I'm<00:03:49.970> going<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.330> take<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.440> more

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
one which I'm going to take this more

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.479 
one which I'm going to take this more
fuel<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:52.850> which<00:03:53.300> needs<00:03:53.600> more<00:03:53.989> air<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:55.220> can

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
fuel and which needs more air this can

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.180 
fuel and which needs more air this can
be<00:03:55.700> easily<00:03:55.970> adopted<00:03:56.810> out<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.350> all<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.739> factors

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
be easily adopted out of all the factors

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.410 
be easily adopted out of all the factors
so<00:03:58.880> I'm<00:03:58.970> going<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.300> erase<00:03:59.780> all<00:03:59.989> these<00:04:00.170> factors

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
so I'm going to erase all these factors

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.570 
so I'm going to erase all these factors
so<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.959> increase<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.650> power<00:04:03.830> output<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
so to increase the power output of the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.420 
so to increase the power output of the
engine<00:04:04.880> we<00:04:05.330> got<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.690> put<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.050> more<00:04:06.260> fuel<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.739> to

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
engine we got to put in more fuel and to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.090 
engine we got to put in more fuel and to
burn<00:04:07.610> more<00:04:07.820> fuel<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.360> need<00:04:08.390> more<00:04:08.720> air<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.620> how

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
burn more fuel we need more air so how

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.180 
burn more fuel we need more air so how
do<00:04:10.160> we<00:04:10.400> put<00:04:10.670> more<00:04:10.880> air<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:12.110> leads<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.800> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
do we put more air that leads to the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.210 
do we put more air that leads to the
innovation<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:14.440> superchargers<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.709> the

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
innovation of superchargers and the
