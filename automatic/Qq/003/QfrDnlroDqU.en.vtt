anyway<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.469> just<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.770> straight<00:00:35.070> ahead

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
anyway and just going straight ahead

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.209 
anyway and just going straight ahead
from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> pencil<00:00:36.270> speed<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.899> wanted<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> try<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that I thought it would be best to go

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
that I thought it would be best to go
ahead<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> stuff<00:00:44.640> scanning

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.319 
ahead and for all the stuff scanning
steps<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.530> share<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.149> have

the<00:01:18.180> finished<00:01:18.600> product<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.740> working<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the finished product I'm working out the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
the finished product I'm working out the
ideal<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.810> pose<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.439> tried<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.310> go

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
ideal basically to pose I tried to go

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.279 
ideal basically to pose I tried to go
for<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.700> forced<00:01:24.030> perspective<00:01:24.149> here<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> can

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
for a forced perspective here as you can

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.340 
for a forced perspective here as you can
see<00:01:25.500> goes<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.610> hands<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.119> large<00:01:27.390> but

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see goes the hands pretty large but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
see goes the hands pretty large but
brother<00:01:28.560> body<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> larger<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.820> for

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
ideally he's coming forward at you at

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.059 
ideally he's coming forward at you at
least<00:01:33.689> auckland<00:01:34.229> leaning<00:01:34.649> forward<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
least auckland leaning forward if

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.999 
least auckland leaning forward if
nothing<00:01:35.399> else<00:01:35.549> his<00:01:36.179> hands<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:36.899> further<00:01:37.560> still

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
nothing else his hands put further still

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.279 
nothing else his hands put further still
and<00:01:38.399> forced<00:01:39.360> perspective<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.929> be<00:01:40.020> kind

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
and forced perspective can be kind

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.050 
and forced perspective can be kind
tricky<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.950> hopefully<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.429> school's<00:01:41.819> pull

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
tricky and hopefully the school's pull

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210 
tricky and hopefully the school's pull
off<00:01:42.210> good<00:01:42.539> enough<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.079> let's<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.039> next

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
off good enough but let's go to the next

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.940 
off good enough but let's go to the next
stage<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.880> next<00:01:45.119> page<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.709> roughing<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:46.830> out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
stage the next page is roughing it out

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
stage the next page is roughing it out

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I could have almost went for the stage

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360 
I could have almost went for the stage
and<00:02:57.420> start<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.750> ink<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:59.160> filled

shady and the coloring job I kind of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.710 
shady and the coloring job I kind of
like<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> still<00:03:05.550> stick<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> old<00:03:06.270> school<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
like to still stick to the old school I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.140 
like to still stick to the old school I
guess<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.470> actually<00:03:07.830> do<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> shading<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
guess and actually do the shading with a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.360 
guess and actually do the shading with a
pen<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.480> ink<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.380> still<00:03:10.830> enhance<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
pen and ink and then still enhance that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.820 
pen and ink and then still enhance that
further<00:03:11.700> when<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.030> write<00:03:12.270> coloring<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.350> what<00:03:13.710> we

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
further when I write coloring so what we

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.140 
further when I write coloring so what we
go<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.490> do<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:14.940> from<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.720> this

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
go what we do is we go from this to this

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.030 
go what we do is we go from this to this
stage<00:03:18.150> where<00:03:18.600> I'm<00:03:18.780> actually<00:03:19.260> adding<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
stage where I'm actually adding the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.860 
stage where I'm actually adding the
shading<00:03:20.400> details<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.240> pencil<00:03:21.690> at<00:03:21.810> first

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
shading details and pencil at first

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.070 
shading details and pencil at first
and<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.890> went<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.909> dark<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.569> dark

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
and so I just went in for dark and dark

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.039 
and so I just went in for dark and dark
areas<00:03:26.319> highlights<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.280> little<00:03:28.090> little<00:03:28.900> bits

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
areas highlights a little little bits

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.460 
areas highlights a little little bits
detail<00:03:29.560> for<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.920> shading<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.690> go<00:03:32.140> from

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
detail for the shading then we go from

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.690 
detail for the shading then we go from
there<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.360> ink<00:03:34.599> stage<00:03:35.099> now<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.159> can<00:03:36.459> see

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
there to the ink stage now you can see

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.410 
there to the ink stage now you can see
it's<00:03:36.849> all<00:03:37.090> black<00:03:37.840> solid<00:03:38.290> black<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.340> white<00:03:40.060> in

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
what we see here is the basic

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.849 
what we see here is the basic
application<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.780> color<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.620> went<00:03:59.799> with

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
application of color I just went with

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.690

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
the red and golden look kavi yellow go

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.069 
the red and golden look kavi yellow go
look<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:05.129> his<00:04:06.129> East<00:04:06.430> Coast<00:04:06.700> wear<00:04:06.910> crimson<00:04:07.720> and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
gold armor ready go and so I go ahead

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.050 
gold armor ready go and so I go ahead
and<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:12.879> filled<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.659> up<00:04:13.690> with<00:04:13.870> black<00:04:14.349> color

on<00:04:16.060> this<00:04:16.239> next<00:04:16.750> part<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.199> had<00:04:17.320> its<00:04:17.530> brown

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
on this next part I had its brown

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.780 
on this next part I had its brown
to<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.390> gold<00:04:19.600> coloring<00:04:20.370> together<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
to the gold coloring together the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.060 
to the gold coloring together the
shading<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.990> go<00:04:23.730> from<00:04:24.730> there<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.300> go<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.900> I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
shading on the go from there I go and I

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.590 
shading on the go from there I go and I
let's<00:04:27.070> say<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> added<00:04:27.640> some<00:04:27.670> white<00:04:27.820> highlights

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
let's say I added some white highlights

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.740 
let's say I added some white highlights
to<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> go<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.160> it's<00:04:30.970> starting<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.420> look<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.600> bit

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
to the go so it's starting to look a bit

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.960 
to the go so it's starting to look a bit
different<00:04:31.780> now<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:33.010> starting<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.820> get<00:04:33.880> away

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
different now it's starting to get away

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
different now it's starting to get away
for<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.210> gold<00:04:34.420> look<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.870> looks<00:04:35.050> kind<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.470> like

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
for the gold look it looks kind of like

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.370 
for the gold look it looks kind of like
a<00:04:35.740> brownish<00:04:36.640> Tampa<00:04:37.210> River<00:04:37.480> don't<00:04:37.660> worry<00:04:37.870> i<00:04:37.990> go

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
a brownish Tampa River don't worry i go

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.530
