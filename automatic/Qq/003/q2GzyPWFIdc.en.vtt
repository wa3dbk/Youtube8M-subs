screencast this screencast will be a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.940 
screencast this screencast will be a
continuation<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.430> our<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:05.850> video<00:00:06.830> where<00:00:07.830> we

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
continuation of our first video where we

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.820 
continuation of our first video where we
set<00:00:08.130> up<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.340> rate<00:00:08.519> n<00:00:08.809> array<00:00:09.809> using<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.530> disk

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
set up a rate n array using for disk

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.390 
set up a rate n array using for disk
drives<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.690> screencast<00:00:13.500> we're<00:00:14.099> assuming

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
drives in this screencast we're assuming

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.240 
drives in this screencast we're assuming
that<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.630> watched<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:16.650> video<00:00:16.920> where

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
that you watched our first video where

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.580 
that you watched our first video where
we<00:00:17.340> set<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.910> four<00:00:18.449> disk<00:00:18.690> array<00:00:19.189> in<00:00:20.189> RAID<00:00:20.670> 10

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
we set up a four disk array in RAID 10

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.130 
we set up a four disk array in RAID 10
so<00:00:22.590> let's<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.949> going

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
so let's get going

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.980 
so let's get going
we<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.410> set<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.070> virtual<00:00:26.490> machine

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
we have set up a virtual machine

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.940 
we have set up a virtual machine
you<00:00:29.740> know<00:00:29.830> right<00:00:30.130> 10-4<00:00:31.029> degree<00:00:31.779> let's<00:00:32.680> start

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
you know right 10-4 degree let's start

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
you know right 10-4 degree let's start
our<00:00:33.130> machine

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.190 

and<00:00:42.950> we're<00:00:43.950> using<00:00:44.130> virtualbox<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.240> our

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and we're using virtualbox as our

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.050 
and we're using virtualbox as our
virtualization<00:00:46.740> software<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> see

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
virtualization software and we can see

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.210 
virtualization software and we can see
our<00:00:51.090> four<00:00:51.420> devices<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.440> two<00:00:52.620> three<00:00:52.890> four

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
our four devices one two three four

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.980 
our four devices one two three four
which<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.270> set<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.540> in<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.750> raid<00:00:54.930> 10<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
which we set up in a raid 10 and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.180 
which we set up in a raid 10 and
essentially<00:00:57.990> we're<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> simulate<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
essentially we're going to simulate a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.650 
essentially we're going to simulate a
disk<00:00:59.850> failure<00:01:01.130> now<00:01:02.130> on<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.059> box<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:04.229> have

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
disk failure now on this box we have

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.240 
disk failure now on this box we have
webmin<00:01:06.950> installed<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.500> we<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.650> access<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
webmin installed and we can access that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.560 
webmin installed and we can access that

our<00:01:59.550> four<00:01:59.729> partitions<00:02:00.110> now<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:02.039> we're<00:02:02.190> going

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
our four partitions now what we're going

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
our four partitions now what we're going
to<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> we're<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.910> simulate<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.720> drive

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
to do is we're going to simulate a drive

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.400 
to do is we're going to simulate a drive
failure<00:02:04.700> let's<00:02:05.700> take<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.810> Drive<00:02:07.259> C<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
failure let's take let's say Drive C and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
failure let's take let's say Drive C and
let's<00:02:10.410> say<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.920> whatever<00:02:11.280> reason<00:02:11.880> that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
let's say that for whatever reason that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.810 
let's say that for whatever reason that
drive<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.530> failed<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.100> we're<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
drive just failed and we're going to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.090 
drive just failed and we're going to
simulate<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.360> failure<00:02:15.780> by<00:02:16.110> removing<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
simulate that failure by removing that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.470 
simulate that failure by removing that
partition<00:02:17.930> from<00:02:18.930> our<00:02:19.110> array<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.150> what<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.269> can

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
partition from our array and what we can

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.229 
partition from our array and what we can
do<00:02:21.630> here<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.800> forward<00:02:23.220> command<00:02:23.550> line<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.090> we

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
do here is forward command line and we

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:35.010 
do here is forward command line and we
do<00:02:26.390> cat

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.820 

MD<00:02:36.020> stead<00:02:36.349> okay<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:38.540> command<00:02:39.019> will<00:02:39.620> show

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
MD stead okay so this command will show

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.040 
MD stead okay so this command will show
us<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.280> our<00:02:40.459> Ray<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> running<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.900> let's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
us that our Ray is running so let's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.040 
us that our Ray is running so let's
remove<00:02:42.349> our<00:02:43.269> partition<00:02:44.269> C<00:02:44.750> or<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:46.660> drive<00:02:47.660> C

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
remove our partition C or the drive C

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.540 
remove our partition C or the drive C
and<00:02:48.379> let's<00:02:48.920> see<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.160> happens<00:02:52.989> see<00:02:53.989> how<00:02:54.230> our

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
and let's see what happens see how our

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.400 
and let's see what happens see how our
rate<00:02:55.550> device<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.360> notifying<00:02:56.930> us<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.319> we

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
new drive and plug it in but obviously

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.850 
new drive and plug it in but obviously
as<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> can<00:03:23.989> see<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:25.630> system<00:03:26.630> is<00:03:26.870> working

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
as you can see the system is working

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.150 
as you can see the system is working
just<00:03:28.069> fine<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:29.360> know

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
just fine you know

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.400 
just fine you know
no<00:03:31.160> no<00:03:31.489> data<00:03:31.760> was<00:03:31.970> lost<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:33.019> just<00:03:33.230> have

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
no no data was lost we just have

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.089 
no no data was lost we just have
essentially<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.340> drive<00:03:34.670> missing<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:36.170> let's

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
essentially a drive missing so let's

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.160 
essentially a drive missing so let's
assume<00:03:37.459> we<00:03:37.519> got<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.150> new<00:03:38.269> drive<00:03:38.510> we<00:03:38.870> plugged

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
assume we got the new drive we plugged

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.910 
assume we got the new drive we plugged
it<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.739> it's<00:03:40.370> showing<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.109> now<00:03:42.109> as<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> new

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
it in and it's showing up now as a new

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.879 
it in and it's showing up now as a new
partition<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.900> case<00:03:45.109> it's<00:03:45.319> showing<00:03:45.470> as

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
partition in this case it's showing as

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.599 
partition in this case it's showing as
device<00:03:46.280> C<00:03:46.549> partition<00:03:47.180> 3<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:48.560> what<00:03:49.069> we<00:03:49.220> need<00:03:49.430> to

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
device C partition 3 so what we need to

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.789 
device C partition 3 so what we need to
do<00:03:49.790> at<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:49.910> point<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.630> we<00:03:50.930> can<00:03:51.109> add<00:03:51.319> this

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
do at this point is we can add this

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.289 
do at this point is we can add this
partition<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.880> our<00:03:53.350> array<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:55.459> if<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.209> were

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
partition to our array so if you were

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:04.920 
partition to our array so if you were
web<00:03:56.510> main<00:03:56.750> Hardware<00:03:57.340> Linux<00:03:58.340> raid

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.720 

choose<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.470> partition<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.159> then<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:06.549> add

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
choose the partition and then we add

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.000 
choose the partition and then we add
that<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.900> our<00:04:08.080> array<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:08.680> what's<00:04:08.860> going<00:04:08.980> to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that to our array now what's going to

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.289 
that to our array now what's going to
happen<00:04:09.129> is<00:04:09.580> you're<00:04:10.239> going<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.390> see<00:04:10.720> how<00:04:11.409> the

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
happen is you're going to see how the

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.899 
happen is you're going to see how the
software<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.599> automatically<00:04:14.730> rebuilding<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
software is automatically rebuilding the

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:24.080 
software is automatically rebuilding the
array<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.449> if<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.690> refresh<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.260> page

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.200 

you<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.240> see<00:04:25.479> how<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.110> 50%<00:04:26.470> or<00:04:27.039> if<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:28.060> go

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
you can see how it's a 50% or if you go

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.529 
you can see how it's a 50% or if you go
to<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.360> command<00:04:28.690> line<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:30.940> issue<00:04:31.150> this

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
to a command line and you issue this

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.170 
to a command line and you issue this
command<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:33.210> can<00:04:34.210> see<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:36.400> percentage<00:04:36.970> so

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
command you can see the percentage so

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.219 
command you can see the percentage so
we're<00:04:37.360> at<00:04:37.449> 76%<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:41.639> now<00:04:42.639> it's<00:04:42.910> at<00:04:43.210> 100%<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:44.199> you

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
we're at 76% and now it's at 100% so you

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.800 
we're at 76% and now it's at 100% so you
can<00:04:44.500> see<00:04:44.800> how<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:46.120> automatically<00:04:48.300> rebuild<00:04:49.300> our

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
can see how it automatically rebuild our

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.159 
can see how it automatically rebuild our
array<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:51.460> same<00:04:52.020> principle<00:04:53.020> would<00:04:53.080> apply

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
array and the same principle would apply

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.860 
array and the same principle would apply
to<00:04:53.860> any<00:04:54.009> of<00:04:54.100> these<00:04:54.190> drive<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:54.789> if<00:04:54.940> d<00:04:55.360> for

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
to any of these drive so if d for

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.110 
to any of these drive so if d for
example<00:04:56.320> fails<00:04:56.620> let's<00:04:57.430> say<00:04:57.699> we're<00:04:57.970> going<00:04:58.060> to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
example fails let's say we're going to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.290 
example fails let's say we're going to
remove<00:04:58.389> device<00:04:59.380> D<00:05:02.820> we're<00:05:03.820> going<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.030> get<00:05:04.120> the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
remove device D we're going to get the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.700 
remove device D we're going to get the
same<00:05:05.039> disk<00:05:06.039> failure<00:05:06.370> notice<00:05:07.440> which<00:05:08.440> is<00:05:08.470> going

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
same disk failure notice which is going

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.129 
same disk failure notice which is going
to<00:05:08.770> show<00:05:09.009> up<00:05:09.070> here<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.940> get<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.240> new<00:05:13.449> drive<00:05:13.690> plug

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
to show up here you get a new drive plug

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.930 
to show up here you get a new drive plug
it<00:05:14.259> in<00:05:14.380> add<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:15.070> partition<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:16.599> the<00:05:16.750> array

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
it in add that partition to the array

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.159 
it in add that partition to the array
and<00:05:18.940> it's<00:05:19.180> going<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.539> rebuild<00:05:19.960> it

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
and it's going to rebuild it

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:28.330 
and it's going to rebuild it
automatically

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.380
