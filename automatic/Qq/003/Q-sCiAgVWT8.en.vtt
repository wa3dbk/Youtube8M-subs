not<00:01:16.729> only<00:01:16.940> kind<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.240> an<00:01:17.360> aesthetic<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
not only kind of an aesthetic but the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.190 
not only kind of an aesthetic but the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
want to you know maybe take control over

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.690 
want to you know maybe take control over
the<00:02:41.660> entire<00:02:41.690> world<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:43.040> created<00:02:43.520> those

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the entire world so they created those

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.970 
the entire world so they created those
characters<00:02:44.270> based<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.200> idea<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.890> know

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
characters based on that idea you know

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.650 
characters based on that idea you know
what<00:02:46.220> would<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.520> do<00:02:46.670> who<00:02:46.910> would<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.180> see<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
what would we do who would we see and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.140 
what would we do who would we see and
then<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.380> was<00:02:48.500> very<00:02:48.739> organic<00:02:49.400> generation<00:02:50.030> of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
then it was very organic generation of

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.550 
then it was very organic generation of
how<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.330> characters<00:02:50.810> came<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
how the characters came about and the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.290 
how the characters came about and the
story<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.160> progressed<00:02:52.520> from<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.000> point

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
story as it progressed from that point

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.330 
story as it progressed from that point
but<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.110> also<00:02:54.230> faster<00:02:54.560> too<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.070> mean<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
but it's also faster too I mean the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.310 
but it's also faster too I mean the
gameplay<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.330> they<00:02:56.510> tweak<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
gameplay is that they tweak it so the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.470 
gameplay is that they tweak it so the
temples<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.739> lot<00:02:57.890> quicker<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:59.120> feels<00:02:59.180> like

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
temples a lot quicker and it feels like

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:44.270 
temples a lot quicker and it feels like
a<00:02:59.540> leaner<00:02:59.870> version<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.709> game<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.040> me

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.400 

I<00:03:44.370> feel<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> only<00:03:45.750> one<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.050> want

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
I feel like this is the only one I want

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.320 
I feel like this is the only one I want
to<00:03:46.470> replay<00:03:46.770> I<00:03:47.220> definitely<00:03:47.640> like<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.060> game

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
to replay I definitely like the game

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330 
to replay I definitely like the game
plates<00:03:48.540> more<00:03:48.720> tactical<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.620> nature<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.220> know

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
plates more tactical in nature you know

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.130 
plates more tactical in nature you know
I<00:03:50.370> think<00:03:50.760> it's<00:03:51.000> definitely<00:03:51.120> more<00:03:51.390> strategic<00:03:51.990> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
I think it's definitely more strategic I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.720 
I think it's definitely more strategic I
don't<00:03:52.319> think<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.530> any<00:03:52.680> more<00:03:52.950> strategic<00:03:53.550> than

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
don't think it's any more strategic than

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.699 
don't think it's any more strategic than
the<00:03:53.910> previous<00:03:54.300> games<00:03:54.569> okay<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.380> think

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
the previous games okay I think

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.080 
the previous games okay I think
definitely<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.490> strategic<00:03:57.000> because

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
definitely it's for strategic because

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.320 
definitely it's for strategic because
like<00:03:57.450> one<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.920> bike<00:03:59.130> right<00:03:59.580> now<00:03:59.850> yeah<00:04:00.120> it's

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
like one on the bike right now yeah it's

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.270 
like one on the bike right now yeah it's
like<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> infantry<00:04:01.020> in<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.290> but<00:04:01.739> now<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:01.980> get

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
like the infantry in it but now you get

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.949 
like the infantry in it but now you get
to<00:04:02.400> go<00:04:02.430> out<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.880> capture<00:04:03.090> bases<00:04:03.600> more<00:04:03.690> quickly

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
to go out and capture bases more quickly

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.960 
to go out and capture bases more quickly
so<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.230> have<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.440> strategize<00:04:04.739> like<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.790> want

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
I mean that's definitely there's no

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
I mean that's definitely there's no

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
purpose of that except for strategy and

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.290 
purpose of that except for strategy and
then<00:04:28.410> there's<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.890> flare<00:04:29.550> tank<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:30.180> know

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300

which<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.690> an<00:04:30.840> awesome<00:04:31.200> unit<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:31.770> not<00:04:32.010> that

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
which is an awesome unit it's not that

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.030 
which is an awesome unit it's not that
powerful<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.940> terms<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.210> taking<00:04:33.390> on<00:04:33.540> other

powerful in terms of taking on other
vehicles<00:04:35.040> but<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.510> could<00:04:36.690> light<00:04:36.840> a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
vehicles but you can it could light a

know<00:06:30.530> some<00:06:30.800> are<00:06:30.919> more<00:06:31.250> than<00:06:31.430> others<00:06:31.550> where

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
know some are more than others where

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.690 
know some are more than others where
they<00:06:33.020> have<00:06:33.169> an<00:06:33.350> offense<00:06:33.830> or<00:06:33.980> defense<00:06:34.160> booster

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
they have an offense or defense booster

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.130 
they have an offense or defense booster
units<00:06:35.000> around<00:06:35.240> it<00:06:35.450> and<00:06:35.600> sometimes<00:06:35.810> it's<00:06:36.080> just

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
units around it and sometimes it's just

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.350 
units around it and sometimes it's just
our<00:06:36.470> chiller<00:06:36.740> II<00:06:36.830> sometimes<00:06:37.400> it's<00:06:37.580> maybe<00:06:38.090> just

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
our chiller II sometimes it's maybe just

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.820 
our chiller II sometimes it's maybe just
aircraft<00:06:38.870> or<00:06:39.050> something<00:06:39.320> I<00:06:39.350> guess<00:06:39.410> you<00:06:39.680> had<00:06:39.800> to

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
aircraft or something I guess you had to

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.680 
aircraft or something I guess you had to
be<00:06:39.919> smart<00:06:40.310> about<00:06:40.400> it<00:06:40.610> but<00:06:41.180> you<00:06:41.270> had<00:06:41.419> to<00:06:41.510> have

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
be smart about it but you had to have

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.210 
be smart about it but you had to have
them<00:06:41.810> on<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.230> battlefield<00:06:42.740> to<00:06:42.860> do<00:06:43.010> anything

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
them on the battlefield to do anything

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.980 
them on the battlefield to do anything
and<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:44.120> thing<00:06:44.270> for<00:06:44.480> me<00:06:44.510> is<00:06:44.600> I<00:06:44.780> kept

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
and the thing for me is I kept

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.450 
and the thing for me is I kept
forgetting<00:06:45.110> to<00:06:45.350> load<00:06:45.620> my<00:06:45.770> units<00:06:46.100> yeah<00:06:46.430> I

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
forgetting to load my units yeah I

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.980 
forgetting to load my units yeah I
thought<00:06:46.790> that<00:06:46.910> it<00:06:47.030> to<00:06:47.180> be<00:06:47.300> a<00:06:47.330> little<00:06:47.419> strange

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
thought that it to be a little strange

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.200 
thought that it to be a little strange
to<00:06:48.110> but<00:06:48.560> at<00:06:48.860> the<00:06:48.980> same<00:06:49.190> time<00:06:49.430> I<00:06:49.490> felt<00:06:49.820> like<00:06:49.970> dual

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
to but at the same time I felt like dual

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.850 
to but at the same time I felt like dual
strike<00:06:50.450> was<00:06:50.660> a<00:06:50.690> little<00:06:51.020> bit<00:06:51.110> too<00:06:51.290> much<00:06:51.530> I

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
strike was a little bit too much I

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.350 
strike was a little bit too much I
actually<00:06:52.100> try<00:06:52.460> to<00:06:52.490> go<00:06:52.669> back<00:06:52.790> and<00:06:52.850> play<00:06:53.210> it

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
actually try to go back and play it

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.390 
actually try to go back and play it
recently<00:06:53.750> and<00:06:54.050> I<00:06:54.350> realized<00:06:54.770> that<00:06:54.890> the<00:06:55.039> game<00:06:55.250> is

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
recently and I realized that the game is

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.890 
recently and I realized that the game is
like

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
like

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.230 
like
broken<00:06:56.410> because<00:06:56.770> I<00:06:57.100> was<00:06:57.430> fighting<00:06:57.610> like<00:06:57.850> a<00:06:57.910> tag

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
broken because I was fighting like a tag

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.200 
broken because I was fighting like a tag
team<00:06:58.540> of<00:06:58.720> these<00:06:58.840> two<00:06:59.110> like<00:06:59.470> off<00:06:59.650> to<00:07:00.520> bad<00:07:00.699> guys<00:07:00.940> I

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
team of these two like off to bad guys I

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.300 
team of these two like off to bad guys I
mean<00:07:01.600> like<00:07:01.750> use<00:07:01.960> their<00:07:02.139> tag-team<00:07:02.470> power<00:07:02.919> on<00:07:03.160> me

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
mean like use their tag-team power on me

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.790 
mean like use their tag-team power on me
and<00:07:03.490> like<00:07:03.580> completely<00:07:04.180> decimated<00:07:04.840> me<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.320> think

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
and like completely decimated me I think

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.749 
and like completely decimated me I think
what<00:07:05.919> days<00:07:06.070> are<00:07:06.190> brewin<00:07:06.460> they<00:07:06.550> really

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
what days are brewin they really

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.730 
what days are brewin they really
stripped<00:07:07.150> it<00:07:07.300> back<00:07:07.479> and<00:07:07.720> was<00:07:07.810> like<00:07:07.870> okay<00:07:08.229> let's

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
stripped it back and was like okay let's

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.620 
stripped it back and was like okay let's
make<00:07:08.949> it<00:07:09.100> really<00:07:09.400> simple<00:07:09.639> but<00:07:10.090> it's<00:07:10.270> not<00:07:10.360> like

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
make it really simple but it's not like

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.330 
make it really simple but it's not like
it<00:07:10.840> doesn't<00:07:11.110> feel<00:07:11.229> like<00:07:11.320> a<00:07:11.380> regression<00:07:12.009> to<00:07:12.190> me

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
it doesn't feel like a regression to me

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.430 
it doesn't feel like a regression to me
I<00:07:12.520> felt<00:07:12.850> like<00:07:12.970> they<00:07:13.150> trim<00:07:13.539> back<00:07:13.780> a<00:07:14.050> little<00:07:14.259> bit

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
I felt like they trim back a little bit

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.719 
I felt like they trim back a little bit
too<00:07:14.620> much<00:07:14.770> especially<00:07:15.009> in<00:07:15.310> terms<00:07:15.400> of<00:07:15.550> features

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
too much especially in terms of features

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.909 
too much especially in terms of features
is<00:07:16.060> like<00:07:16.210> I<00:07:16.389> actually<00:07:16.780> kind<00:07:17.110> of<00:07:17.139> like<00:07:17.199> survival

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 
is like I actually kind of like survival

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.680 
is like I actually kind of like survival
and<00:07:18.070> combat<00:07:18.490> modes<00:07:18.729> from<00:07:18.940> dual<00:07:19.210> strike<00:07:19.539> you

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
and combat modes from dual strike you

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.020 
and combat modes from dual strike you
know<00:07:19.780> the<00:07:19.900> videos<00:07:20.229> are<00:07:20.350> real-time<00:07:20.820> version<00:07:21.820> of

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
know the videos are real-time version of

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.490 
know the videos are real-time version of
advanced<00:07:22.389> wars<00:07:22.600> in<00:07:22.750> there<00:07:22.840> so<00:07:23.020> it<00:07:23.110> seems<00:07:23.350> like

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
advanced wars in there so it seems like

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.650 
advanced wars in there so it seems like
you<00:07:23.530> strip<00:07:23.860> away<00:07:23.949> some<00:07:24.400> features<00:07:24.789> you<00:07:25.389> strip

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.660 
you strip away some features you strip

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.379 
you strip away some features you strip
away<00:07:25.690> some<00:07:26.110> of<00:07:26.139> that<00:07:26.440> aspect<00:07:26.860> of<00:07:27.729> personality

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:28.389 
away some of that aspect of personality

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.110 
away some of that aspect of personality
in<00:07:28.510> the<00:07:28.600> game<00:07:28.750> but<00:07:29.440> I<00:07:29.770> don't<00:07:30.550> think<00:07:30.699> I<00:07:30.820> want<00:07:31.030> to

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
in the game but I don't think I want to

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.000 
in the game but I don't think I want to
go<00:07:31.210> back<00:07:31.240> I<00:07:31.690> think<00:07:31.930> this<00:07:32.020> is<00:07:32.080> a<00:07:32.229> much<00:07:32.710> tighter

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010 
go back I think this is a much tighter

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.029 
go back I think this is a much tighter
game<00:07:33.400> it's<00:07:33.669> more<00:07:34.020> smarter<00:07:35.020> is<00:07:35.199> more<00:07:35.410> tactical

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 
game it's more smarter is more tactical

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.659 
game it's more smarter is more tactical
and<00:07:36.310> plus<00:07:37.210> you<00:07:37.720> know<00:07:37.870> online<00:07:38.470> play<00:07:38.710> is<00:07:38.949> pretty

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:39.669
