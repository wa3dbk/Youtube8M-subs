is the last product of ATA arms
Wednesday<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> new<00:00:11.790> has<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> new<00:00:12.450> system<00:00:12.870> new

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
Wednesday is a new has a new system new

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 
Wednesday is a new has a new system new
gas<00:00:13.500> pressure<00:00:13.830> system<00:00:14.370> control<00:00:14.849> system<00:00:15.150> over

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
gas pressure system control system over

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.660 
gas pressure system control system over
here<00:00:17.000> it<00:00:18.000> controls<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.500> gas<00:00:19.680> pressure<00:00:19.949> with

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
here it controls the gas pressure with

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.450 
here it controls the gas pressure with
all<00:00:20.880> cartridges<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.170> weights<00:00:22.470> from

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
all cartridges with all weights from

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.769 
all cartridges with all weights from
light<00:00:23.760> load<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> lot<00:00:24.539> without

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
light load to have a lot without

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.210 
light load to have a lot without
changing<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> piston<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.800> piston

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
changing the piston so with one piston

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.650 
changing the piston so with one piston
you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.519> use<00:00:29.670> reliably<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.189> shell<00:00:32.660> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you can use reliably all the shell in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
you can use reliably all the shell in
all<00:00:33.840> weights<00:00:34.880> it<00:00:35.880> has<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> lot<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> features

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
all weights it has got a lot of features

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
all weights it has got a lot of features
because<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> gas<00:00:38.010> control<00:00:38.850> system<00:00:40.610> reduces

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
because the gas control system reduces

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
because the gas control system reduces
the<00:00:41.700> recoil<00:00:42.860> give<00:00:43.860> stability<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> gun<00:00:46.430> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the recoil give stability to the gun it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.619 
the recoil give stability to the gun it
has<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:48.170> dropout<00:00:49.170> trigger<00:00:49.620> system<00:00:50.449> just<00:00:51.449> like

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
has got dropout trigger system just like

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.500 
has got dropout trigger system just like
in<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.820> range

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
in all other range

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
in all other range
it<00:00:55.990> has<00:00:56.170> got<00:00:56.380> a<00:00:56.650> good<00:00:57.640> hood<00:00:57.850> high-grade<00:00:58.690> wood

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it has got a good hood high-grade wood

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
it has got a good hood high-grade wood
with<00:01:00.070> Matt<00:01:00.310> oily<00:01:00.700> finish<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.930> have<00:01:05.430> mainly

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
with Matt oily finish and we have mainly

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.410 
with Matt oily finish and we have mainly
which<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.860> new<00:01:09.010> choke<00:01:09.250> system<00:01:09.640> for<00:01:10.030> Venza

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
which the new choke system for Venza

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.860 
which the new choke system for Venza
which<00:01:11.230> is<00:01:11.380> longer<00:01:11.680> than<00:01:12.640> standard<00:01:13.090> other

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
which is longer than standard other

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.380 
which is longer than standard other
utter<00:01:14.380> products<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.610> seventy<00:01:16.030> millimeter

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
utter products it is seventy millimeter

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.920 
utter products it is seventy millimeter
long<00:01:16.690> chops<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.830> call<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:18.190> when<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.670> choke

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
long chops we call this when the choke

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
long chops we call this when the choke
system

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
system

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.929 
system
so<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.990> gun<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> new<00:01:22.829> shape<00:01:23.130> totally<00:01:23.789> new

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so this gun has a new shape totally new

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.649 
so this gun has a new shape totally new
design<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.500> got<00:01:25.710> line<00:01:26.520> from<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.509> its

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
design it has got line from all over its

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.310 
design it has got line from all over its
receiver<00:01:28.670> forint<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> stuck

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
receiver forint and stuck

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
receiver forint and stuck
so<00:01:32.980> from<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.550> foreign<00:01:34.420> cap<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:36.070> are<00:01:36.190> whole

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so from the foreign cap there are whole

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
so from the foreign cap there are whole
let<00:01:38.350> me<00:01:38.470> show<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.940> these<00:01:39.940> holes<00:01:40.300> gives<00:01:41.290> them

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
let me show you these holes gives them

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.780 
let me show you these holes gives them
gas<00:01:42.790> pressure<00:01:43.180> out<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:45.660> heavy<00:01:46.660> load<00:01:46.900> shells

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
gas pressure out in heavy load shells

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.170 
gas pressure out in heavy load shells
just<00:01:48.790> redo<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.570> reduce<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.350> recoil<00:01:53.100> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just redo it reduce the recoil so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.250 
just redo it reduce the recoil so
basically<00:01:55.180> these<00:01:55.390> are<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.600> new<00:01:55.810> features<00:01:56.230> of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
basically these are the new features of

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.100 
basically these are the new features of
the<00:01:56.730> last<00:01:57.730> product<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.270> four<00:01:58.450> terms<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.960> new

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
the last product all four terms the new

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.960 
the last product all four terms the new
Venza<00:01:59.610> thank<00:02:00.610> you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.030 

you
