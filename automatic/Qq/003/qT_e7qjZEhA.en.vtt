this hangar right here so once you've
found<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> Titan<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.750> need<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> get

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
found this Titan we need to do is get

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
found this Titan we need to do is get
your<00:00:37.559> friend<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> hop<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> front<00:00:38.460> where

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
your friend to hop in the front where

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.690 
your friend to hop in the front where
the<00:00:39.360> pilot<00:00:39.750> seat<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.190> enable

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the pilot seat is and get into enable

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
the pilot seat is and get into enable
passive<00:00:42.090> mode<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.690> now<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.960> need<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.410> behind

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
passive mode so now we need to be behind

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
passive mode so now we need to be behind
the<00:00:43.920> Titan<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.789> car<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.660> drive

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the Titan in a car and you can drive

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
the Titan in a car and you can drive
slightly<00:00:46.200> inside<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> tighten<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
slightly inside to tighten as your

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
slightly inside to tighten as your
friend<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.610> passive<00:00:48.030> mode<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> don't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
friend is in passive mode and you don't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
friend is in passive mode and you don't
want<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.050> far<00:00:49.410> enough<00:00:49.649> y'see<00:00:49.950> splitter

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
want to go too far enough y'see splitter

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.799 
want to go too far enough y'see splitter
won't<00:00:50.430> work<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> go<00:00:51.390> too<00:00:51.449> far

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
won't work I don't want to go too far

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
won't work I don't want to go too far
back<00:00:52.079> otherwise<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.590> won't<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.160> go

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
back otherwise it won't so just go

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740 
back otherwise it won't so just go
around<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> am<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
around the point where I am and it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
around the point where I am and it
should<00:00:54.930> work<00:00:54.960> perfectly<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.920> anyway<00:00:56.309> once

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
should work perfectly so anyway once

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.680 
should work perfectly so anyway once
you're<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> position<00:00:57.000> you'll<00:00:57.449> need<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you're in this position you'll need to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
you're in this position you'll need to
tell<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.020> friend<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> exit<00:00:58.890> passive<00:00:59.219> mode<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
tell your friend to exit passive mode it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
tell your friend to exit passive mode it
will<00:00:59.760> take<00:00:59.879> around<00:01:00.030> 10<00:01:00.329> seconds<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:00.930> out

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
will take around 10 seconds to get out

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.389 
will take around 10 seconds to get out
of<00:01:01.109> passive<00:01:01.440> mode<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> you'll<00:01:02.010> need<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> get

your<00:01:05.640> friend<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> passive<00:01:06.479> mode<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
your friend is out to passive mode you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.840 
your friend is out to passive mode you
can<00:01:07.229> hop<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.830> car<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:08.670> be

glitching<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.020> walk

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
glitching out a little bit just walk

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
glitching out a little bit just walk
forwards<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:10.890> backwards<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.939> works<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
as you'll see you will be in the Titan

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
as you'll see you will be in the Titan
this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.060> cool<00:01:15.210> choking<00:01:15.509> grunt<00:01:15.689> f05

downloaded two discs that you cannot

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
downloaded two discs that you cannot
actually<00:01:20.159> fly<00:01:20.369> otherwise<00:01:21.299> you'll<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.659> lit

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually fly otherwise you'll just lit

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
actually fly otherwise you'll just lit
out<00:01:22.200> however<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.979> friend<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.520> actually
