00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone with you arklid and today we 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.170
 consider team tactics on 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.240
 Himmelsdorf map is probably a map 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 is the hardest to play ki 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.219
 our standard setup vs more 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
 weighted enemy so we will 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 avoid head-on collisions and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 rely on cunning and tactical 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.359
 having played let's go by tradition let's start with 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.789
 attacks on first base and so our 1390 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.010
 right after the start of the fight no birds squared 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 g6 gets there the hospital and tries 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.369
 give a few lung shots 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 enemy tank who can 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 try to give highlight through area 2 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 of 3 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.870
 go on 4 lines and go to the square 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.270
 square and 4 where all stand in a corner 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.579
 the rest of the tanks go over the track to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 railway at the same time they need to be 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.149
 vigilant there might be an enemy 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.039
 tank which they should immediately 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 destroy after we made sure 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.820
 what's on our side of the railway 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 no more opponents our tanks 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.120
 become as follows on g-1 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 near the houses becomes ru 251 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.420
 50100 goes to the square and 1 and our bulldog 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.610
 gently drives out of the cars going 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.460
 grip circle so that the building 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 standing beside him closed him from 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.189
 enemy tanks which most likely 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.850
 there will be a train station the task of our 50100 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.320
 and ru 251 control a square and one in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.799
 which is likely to be a tank 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 an opponent trying to shoot down 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.210
 further our triples perform as follows about 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.450
 they take him crackdown on the area of one of the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.520
 them slips into d3 square and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.409
 becomes behind the building while on the go 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.750
 she gives a shot to the enemy tank 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.920
 which is likely to be 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.640
 control the third line from the square 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.360
 b3 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.429
 but she can get a shot back 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.189
 2 esprit gently drives along 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.530
 right buildings on 3 lines and overclocking 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.140
 call in the hospital after our with 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.860
 the third took a position on j3 square and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.170
 scared off enemy tanks from square b3 2 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.710
 bulldog with railway returns 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.310
 across to our 1390 line along with 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.290
 which they combine and pass by 5 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.670
 lines to go to the rear to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.130
 an opponent who will try 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.170
 shoot down the grip as he doesn't 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.329
 there will be another choice besides 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.610
 to exit through the square c2 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.660
 which will already control our 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.239
 50100 and 251 vol. If they are to 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.940
 the time killed tanks on a1 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.099
 for us the main thing to remember is that the enemy 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.799
 tank station standing on c 2 square 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.660
 is the least priority goal so 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.030
 as he can almost nothing beyond 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.340
 there to do the main task is not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.579
 give the enemy you though through the square 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.380
 c2 to capture capture and a third 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.959
 line 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.540
 our 1390 and bulldog come from 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.970
 squares b5 themselves choose the moment for 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.250
 attacks on an adversary who was in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.079
 squared b the three most vulnerable he 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.930
 when will begin to move toward 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.010
 capture capture 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.109
 if we see the opponent's setup 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.230
 mobile enough we can play 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.780
 second base and so right after the start of the battle 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.819
 Our ru 251 and bulldog ride on mountain 1390 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.829
 flies into a square c8 through a banana and 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.690
 becomes there in such a way that 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.910
 cut off the escape route 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.910
 which may be on the square b 0 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.660
 illumination the descent from the mountain and try 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 run away 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.980
 seeing our tanks going down on him 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.900
 on top of 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.480
 the second bulldog gets into position on 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.950
 squares 6 loopholes and trying to give 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.049
 several shots on a light tank 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.209
 an adversary who can give for light 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.250
 across the square 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.470
 heavy tanks drive through the banana on 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.420
 fifth line and stop at the square 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.799
 c5 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.090
 after that everyone drove up on the right one 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.739
 positions we act like this 251 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.840
 squared b 0 and tries 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.700
 from there to shoot at the enemy 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.190
 which will glow in the hospital on 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.799
 a4 square 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.720
 the bulldog flies into a8 square and not 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:10.599
 glows there 1390 flies in a square in 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.670
 8 and becomes there for a bunch of trash it 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.950
 the main task so far only give 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.949
 initial light on those who can 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.250
 shine a new line 50100 becomes 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.919
 in a position near the right courtyard building 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.919
 of and the third one of them stays in 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.280
 squared c 5a 2 strip drive up 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.930
 on a square in 5 and trying to sarin there 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.150
 get under this way under the tank 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.440
 adversary standing in hospital so that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.320
 this does not take damage 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.260
 that moment when it is lit our 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.610
 50100 and IS-3 immediately begin moving to 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.650
 square d 3 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.810
 there their task is to try their tank 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.419
 adversary pulling from train stations 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.130
 bottle to the main forces since after 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.740
 to light our heavy tank on 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.810
 squared d5 opponent decides that we will 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.090
 attack second base through fifth line 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.789
 and try to pull all their strength on 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.490
 receiving this attack after our tank 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.099
 b5 from glow he joins our 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.050
 it is desirable for the main group of 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.780
 he slipped into square c3 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.340
 after seeing our heavy tanks on 3 lines 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.569
 the opponent is likely to try 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.259
 pick them up 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.999
 at this moment the task of our light tanks 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:22.839
 maximally reach behind enemy lines 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:25.029
 and heavy to drive back and survive until 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.139
 of that time, if not in support will come 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.300
 light tanks 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.610
 so we lure the enemy 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.080
 from powerful defense positions that 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.270
 allows us to either get on 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.909
 second base either destroy with two 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.209
 sides when playing defense our journey 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.319
 will be such a square one becomes ru 

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:44.619
 251 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:47.499
 squared c 2 becomes of 3 near 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:49.419
 hospital on zither we put bulldog 2 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:53.830
 art figure becomes hospital squared 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:56.439
 a4 the remaining tanks are 50100 and 1390 and 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.509
 bulldog become out of the bottle 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:01.059
 in such a way as to target the exit 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.949
 the enemy from the fifth line the attack case 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.559
 opponent on first base we will 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:08.889
 proceed as follows 1 bulldog 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.869
 becomes a square in d3 at an angle of 2 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.409
 the bulldog runs through the fifth line in 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:18.189
 side of the square from 3 and 50100 drive up 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.990
 squared d 3 where 50100 for the purpose of his id 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.899
 enemy tank which can stand behind 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.019
 building on the square e-1 and of 3 tries 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:28.659
 knock off the capture from first base 

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:31.389
 1390 flies farther into square f2 and 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.309
 there becomes his task near the building 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.559
 together with our bulldog who drove 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:38.199
 through the area destroy the enemy tank 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:40.449
 which may be on g3 square 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.629
 if the opponent tries to reach 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.659
 of our 1390 he will be under cover 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.579
 our bulldog and heavy tanks we 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.740
 gently bring down the base capture and at the same time 

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:52.930
 trying not to get a lot 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.119
 the enemy will have no other damage 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.910
 exit except to shoot with you 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.640
 either try to leave 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.340
 then our light tanks will cut him off 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.660
 waste and destroy it 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.520
 if the opponent is trying to break into 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.680
 second base through the fifth line then he 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.720
 Immediately must lose one tank from our 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.550
 drums isa the third which after 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.740
 the shot is pulled back a little 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.200
 prisoners orphaned our light tanks 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.720
 act as follows bulldog from 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.870
 square c3 drives to the hospital on 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.270
 j6 squared and from there knocks down the base 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.660
 from an enemy tank standing on the round 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.620
 capture behind the backs of their allies 2 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.460
 bulldog and 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:35.250
 ru 251 go through d line to them 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.560
 joins and 1390 after our 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.190
 IS-3 will return from the station to the rescue 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.080
 a bottle 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.390
 after our light tanks 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.940
 light up the enemy may try 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.860
 push through our burdens while doing so 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.470
 have to hang back and give time 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.780
 our enemy to go to the enemy in the rear 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.710
 we clamp it in very uncomfortable 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.390
 position on squares b4 to 5 and 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:00.540
 we destroy from two sides in narrow passage 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.310
 and thank you for your attention if you have
