now<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.349> wasn't<00:02:09.799> quite<00:02:09.950> sure<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.700> was

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
now I wasn't quite sure of what was

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.309 
now I wasn't quite sure of what was
going<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.239> right<00:02:11.299> here<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.019> ended<00:02:12.230> up

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
going on right here so I ended up

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.440 
going on right here so I ended up
clicking<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.129> cancel<00:02:13.489> button<00:02:13.790> there<00:02:14.360> was

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
clicking the cancel button there was

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.630 
clicking the cancel button there was
hyperlinked<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.709> said<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.280> would

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
hyperlinked and it said that I would

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.119 
hyperlinked and it said that I would
have<00:02:16.730> lose<00:02:16.970> my<00:02:17.360> xbox<00:02:17.870> live<00:02:18.140> subscription<00:02:18.170> on

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
have lose my xbox live subscription on

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.530 
have lose my xbox live subscription on
Friday<00:02:19.730> June<00:02:20.209> 17<00:02:20.799> 2016<00:02:21.909> because<00:02:22.909> Microsoft

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
Friday June 17 2016 because Microsoft

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.880 
Friday June 17 2016 because Microsoft
will<00:02:23.840> not<00:02:24.080> renew<00:02:24.560> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
will not renew it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160 
will not renew it
so<00:02:25.159> this<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.549> pretty<00:02:25.730> much<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:26.299> canceling

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
so this is pretty much just canceling

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.759 
so this is pretty much just canceling
the<00:02:27.890> renew<00:02:28.549> feature<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.750> even<00:02:30.079> after<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.409> did

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
the renew feature but even after I did

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.890 
the renew feature but even after I did
that<00:02:30.799> it<00:02:31.220> still<00:02:31.549> said<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.849> my<00:02:32.180> next<00:02:32.510> charge

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
that it still said that my next charge

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.240 
that it still said that my next charge
would<00:02:33.349> be<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.849> June<00:02:34.849> 1st<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.620> it's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
would be on June 1st so there it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.490 
would be on June 1st so there it's
really<00:02:37.760> confusing<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.629> what's<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:39.019> on<00:02:39.230> here

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
really confusing of what's going on here

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.319 
really confusing of what's going on here
I'm<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.739> quite<00:02:40.069> sure<00:02:40.099> when<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:40.849> gonna<00:02:41.060> lose

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
I'm not quite sure when I'm gonna lose

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.750 
I'm not quite sure when I'm gonna lose
my<00:02:41.359> xbox<00:02:42.049> live<00:02:42.410> because<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.370> telling<00:02:43.609> me

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
my xbox live because it's telling me

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.490 
my xbox live because it's telling me
that<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.180> going<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.420> charge<00:02:44.690> me<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.019> one<00:02:45.260> date

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that it's going to charge me on one date

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.410 
that it's going to charge me on one date
but<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:46.099> I'm<00:02:46.190> gonna<00:02:46.310> lose<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.030> another

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
but then I'm gonna lose it on another

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.289 
but then I'm gonna lose it on another

and I ended up renewing it today on
August<00:02:51.140> 2nd<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.069> I'm<00:02:52.160> not<00:02:52.310> quite<00:02:52.549> sure<00:02:52.700> on

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
August 2nd so I'm not quite sure on

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.630 
August 2nd so I'm not quite sure on
what's<00:02:53.540> happening<00:02:54.049> here<00:02:54.379> but<00:02:54.829> this<00:02:55.129> is<00:02:55.370> where

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
what's happening here but this is where

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.300 
what's happening here but this is where
I<00:02:55.670> ended<00:02:56.420> up<00:02:56.540> checking<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.349> was<00:02:57.590> able<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.920> see

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
I guess a good estimate of when I was

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.690 
I guess a good estimate of when I was
going<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:01.970> lose<00:03:02.239> my<00:03:03.140> next<00:03:03.530> Xbox<00:03:04.010> Live
