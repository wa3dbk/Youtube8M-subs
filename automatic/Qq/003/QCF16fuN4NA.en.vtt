00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.529
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 I bring you a video with 5 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:23.210
 characteristics of what Apple claims 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.119
 that samsung has stolen you are good 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.259
 very simple features that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.020
 competent in fact all with their 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.600
 patents and well I remind you this video 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.180
 I do not say it, I say it directly to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 Paul before the Android fanboys 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.980
 they start attacking , I do not say it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.380
 Apple says good the 5,940 patent and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 6.647 tells us that the system and method 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.239
 to perform an action is a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.210
 structure of data generated by 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.220
 good computer by using this function to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 I recognize certain key words 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.210
 in a message emails and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 all kinds of text becomes that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 links become a clear example 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.049
 of this feature is what allows 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.189
 to the device detect words or 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 phrases such as tonight the next 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.970
 Saturday 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.689
 some days monday tuesday wednesday 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 Thursday, Friday, well, this makes 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.240
 highlight and when you press send us 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.110
 directly to the calendar to see if 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.970
 We are free or to add a new 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 event in case we already have 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 busy one of these days will make us 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 a reminder of the appointment we have 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.720
 this assures us apple that samsung will 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.039
 is stealing in a criminal way 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 well we also find the patent 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:53.759
 6.847 point 959 and this refers to the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.490
 universal interface for recovery 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.310
 of information in a system 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.800
 computerized good according to apple this 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 patent is basic to perform 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 universal searches we mean by 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 universal search that in which with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.390
 just enter a text in the bar 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 search for the iphone or the ios ios 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.430
 responsible for finding results in all 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.480
 the apple devices and allows 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.450
 also 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.060
 the search all over the internet or 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.580
 some concrete pages like clear 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.610
 example we can put wikipedia we can 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.319
 put the song that we like and if the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.430
 we have in our device does not go 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.040
 to winnow at our device and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
 can also increase us to internet 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 come out this I think it's more than clear 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.730
 the spray that everyone has in turn 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.629
 and well we also find the patent 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.599
 7.761 point 14 and this is the 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.769
 Synchronous data synchronization between 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.019
 zeal devices where you can go 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.030
 to the title despite the title 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.400
 the patent simply describes the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.769
 process by which an application can 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 interact with the user while 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.690
 simultaneously performs tasks 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.750
 background synchronization 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.750
 in this way one can add a note 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 in the application notes while the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.660
 application sends you directly to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.250
 icloud to be available 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.780
 automatically in the rest of your 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.910
 dispositives 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.860
 or in case of the computer or essex 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.990
 good though the timing of 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.750
 different devices already existed a lot 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.510
 before this patent focuses icloud 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.480
 in a concrete process that performs the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.000
 task more simply and so 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.239
 immediate we also find the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.790
 patent 8.0 46,700 21 and it is for 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.000
 unlock a device through 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.830
 gestures in a good unlock image 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.280
 with the title because I think it tells us 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.459
 everything is patent refers to the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.340
 unlock screen before them the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.370
 smartphone when activating went directly 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.739
 to the main screen thing that could 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.120
 cause chaos in the mobile if it 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.160
 lit on its own while 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.260
 we were in good while the phone 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.650
 It was in your pocket in your bag 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 hand in your backpack and any other 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 where I put your device and you could 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.010
 make a call or the phone could 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 make a call without our 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.380
 consent could send a message 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.600
 strange with 50,000 letters or face 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.270
 that they had nothing to say without 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.700
 even you know good the blessed 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.280
 Slide to unlock solution 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.720
 our problem and with it some that 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.610
 another embarrassing moment comes out then is that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.770
 the truth of cecilia of truth has 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.470
 The whole reason is patent, do not set aside 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.020
 of the air the air is there was not this 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.840
 Unlock to perform this amazing 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:05.190
 and finally we finally found the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:08.010
 patent 8.0 74 point 172 system method 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.610
 and graphic interface for the recommendation 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.160
 of words or good simplified the car 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.070
 corrector although apple did not invent 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.100
 this concept did create a method of 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.590
 self-correction incredibly easy and 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.840
 direct the corrections are shown 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.880
 right where we are writing and if 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.270
 we want to accept them just simply 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.760
 with pressing space or touching the word 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.520
 that indicate good in this case 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.450
 Android does not use exactly the same 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.220
 model 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.830
 the correction options shown 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.530
 on the keyboard but in ios too 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.380
 uses the formula of pressing space 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.000
 to accept what is curious is 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.760
 that only the screen option of 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.380
 unlocking is specific to samsung the 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.720
 rest of features that form 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.030
 part of the package of android thing that 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.030
 supports the theory that the true 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.630
 objective of apple demand would not be 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.530
 against samsung but directly with 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.140
 google that is already half-weird there 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.710
 but good 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:16.139
 this is an agreement or an article that has 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.810
 removed from the page 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.490
 and it was a good man I leave 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.379
 in the description of the video the truth does not 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.479
 I remember exactly but I'll leave it to you 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.509
 in the description of the video and this 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.400
 page gives us the key to the defense of 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.139
 samsung for all this judgment that has been 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.689
 been doing since we all know the 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.870
 trial that takes years and that is that samsung 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:40.199
 he defends himself by saying you know what I support 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:43.319
 I take out my phones more without me 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:46.349
 I have no control over android android 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.900
 Google handles it in case of your demands 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:52.259
 you have to do them with google not 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.930
 against me and is completely right 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.060
 but hey that is another issue that is not 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.650
 is another theme for the video but good 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:04.710
 these are the five patents that apple 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.150
 secures and claims he has stolen samsung 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.710
 so good friends then remember 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.750
 We could control with your thumb up 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.580
 with your comment if you liked this 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.129
 small video thank you very much for 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.310
 watch the channel and see you 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:19.820
 in the next friends 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.820
 bye bye
