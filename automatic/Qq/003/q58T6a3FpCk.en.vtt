00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.250
 yes hello friends 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.720
 hear today 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.580
 show something I learn 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.009
 4 1 Victory received 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.859
 Percent I have 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.449
 when I started when mine bought gold for the time being 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 I have somewhere 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.880
 from the music 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.909
 around 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.429
 a present to come 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.749
 I have myself Reuther 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.989
 when do you ever get one 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.039
 for free 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 Nasdaq device members like 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.120
 imagine the thing Billeter then he is thanks Lipton maybe creates 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.890
 So there are several 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.140
 Distortion free called there are good german rendered / ice thawed in the evening 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 music 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.630
 his albums felt honored Vettel 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.010
 the different signals 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.140
 Röttgen must be with you now per minute because of it 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.200
 I am we offer a list not a big fan of Dede 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.390
 Effect flourish and so on but I'm afraid to continue antechambers 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.340
 because Velbert if if if you're there can not judge judgment 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.980
 yes, this percent 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 we the most beautiful the s10 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280
 he is actually 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.420
 Say «for you» 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.030
 not suitable for metal 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.790
 to deliver high-quality results and so cute so a sensation 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.310
 for Kloten on the other hand blood so on it is suitable as well for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.010
 he just has everything else 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.820
 too few percent 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.970
 that too little is expected 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.940
 so imitate 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 there is such a historical button here once 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 the criteria 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 how much the Internet in the world like Bentley 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 My husband supports 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 therefore one may do that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 So in his cave discovered strength 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920
 and percent 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.780
 for the hard-rocker is always best that Porsche now Oberstaufen 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.839
 according to Riekel full load 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:09.729
 these 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.039
 other opponents here plead 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.269
 you can here 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.739
 the volume signal control and that serve from percent 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.539
 in Minden in harmony with the amplifier 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.509
 Willow if in which I wanted as a performance 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.509
 and set here firing amplifier in China 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.999
 he hits the bypass button 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.069
 activates the device 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.339
 that shaves report 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.759
 the hair threw off Merkel 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.529
 that's why there should be reason for that before, according to the examining magistrate 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.569
 around 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.939
 I understand he did it, too 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.799
 So my head created the authorities 1 6% it at 3 75 watts 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.379
 I have also provided my team and quite neutral all effects 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.789
 really all 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.209
 and dumb 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.739
 will now really show how the thing reacts 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.359
 I have to apply 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.259
 the Melissa set in vain for a term where I believe that it makes sense 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.109
 could come 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.229
 and would 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.299
 I show promotion of the local partner skin variants when dealing with the 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.129
 Bite Costner plays around 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 the volume of people the mystics who always leave the same 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.809
 when you play around 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.489
 at the best always 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.209
 close to hers if you want to stop the distortion 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.979
 or if she just goes straight 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
 always directly on the amplifier 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.269
 Alan Clyne 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 ca 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.869
 Yes 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.209
 years 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.929
 more 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.259
 May 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.259
 on 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.389
 nobody 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.490
 DAPD 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.439
 "It certainly is not what he said 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.069
 because especially in the area low 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.710
 and only if positive vote 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 similar 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.219
 the data was not it was his 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.939
 around 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.939
 to show off a possible counterattack 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.830
 Next 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 Herne 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.729
 Dr 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.189
 on 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.580
 Japan contained 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.189
 so much more flexible with the thing is possible 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.219
 around 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.219
 for the blouse rocker it's a nice thing 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.589
 for the respiratory system this nothing 

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:16.589
 that was it 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.449
 There was nothing more to say about it 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.449
 that was for me already 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:23.970
 look
