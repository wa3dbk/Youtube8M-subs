00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 case of aline and I come here for you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 showed in my first video today a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 chain to the power chair that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.519
 I chose the wind for a little girl. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 when he was six months old and started 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.949
 eat the solid foods 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.730
 This is such a tiny little seat. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.980
 how cute cuddly here and I'll 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.980
 show you why I chose this 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.870
 chair 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.760
 first i chose this chair 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.260
 but cause of the value 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.440
 I was looking for a chair whose 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.150
 son and I'm going to be honest is that as 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.220
 interior designer I'm not 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.100
 liking none practically that I 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.629
 way of beauty would not go 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.440
 add absolutely nothing in 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.629
 decoration of my room and I started to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 search more cute and see what 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.070
 had an abusive and absurd value and 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.289
 there is the slightest possibility that I 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.990
 pay that much in those chairs 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:16.690
 more wonderful than they were then 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.270
 I found her shining on the blog in a 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.880
 Baby stuff for sale site and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 value was within my budget 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.119
 close to the values ​​of the two strollers 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.300
 that he did not like it because it was too 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.720
 big and I wanted something cooler 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.860
 they really want it 's cute, she's cute 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.900
 has a whole texture line and around it is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.140
 greening is basic if you do not have a future 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.000
 one girl can also use and the other 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.090
 advantages that I'll show you 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.390
 now this keko chair and I think 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 that I did not say 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.370
 She's one of those charles martin and she's 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.890
 precisely why you are 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.140
 Seeing she loves it, she looks beautiful. 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.320
 Even I have shown her well. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 compact and little angels this 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.180
 very nice chair and one of the reasons is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 that you can keep inside her that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.040
 open your little feet to raise the place you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.040
 Do you want to go there and use that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.660
 opposition to show you then the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.970
 noise that most of the strollers 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.580
 But it's cool, we'll show you. 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.040
 she has an awesome band upstairs extra 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.660
 so you can wash every machine 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.709
 that's where people do a lot 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.739
 mess 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.209
 so it's super necessary she learned 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.120
 here the tray has three positions that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.580
 property of the Xingu that we schedule the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.180
 90 in the kitchen and when it grows 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 I'm going to pull forward and I can use 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.190
 could be a little bigger or remove 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.560
 because we'll be trays I 'll give 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 they have cadmium in front of it without 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.070
 band is even the five-point belt 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590
 and it is interesting is necessary for the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.290
 money does not slide forward right 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.170
 because he gets stuck here and super easy 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.030
 hold and release and also release 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.760
 of the chair for you to wash 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 he is white is a disadvantage between 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.940
 the ones you put in the middle of white 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.860
 it fits you well and stays right there and here the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.489
 olive oil also released 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.690
 you can wash psi it was necessary 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.290
 to pass a cloth 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.909
 I think it's very 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.890
 Josef, I do not think that makes chairs. 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.049
 great to have support everywhere is 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.450
 all because I think 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.920
 It's hard to have a shovel and I think so 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.769
 makes the child have a posture 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.659
 the most ideal because the good how to stay 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.790
 Coladinho, now he's already a mouse. 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.780
 understood what it 's like to represent 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.629
 chair 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.390
 Furthermore in older children she has 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.920
 a bar here and has good height if 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.959
 you are sitting in the chair everything 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:06.930
 opportunity you're at legal time 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:06.930
 to give the child good food 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.070
 ae 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.220
 the minute 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.880
 good now you saw with a boy that 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.880
 to be able to take it to that position also 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.130
 is used for the second 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.140
 directly support the chair within the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.970
 we have felt like these 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.340
 so you can hold the chair to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.520
 do not slip and you can use 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.180
 both by using your own see if 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.260
 want ahead here when the child 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.260
 is a little bigger 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.630
 How can you loose this afternoon? 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.300
 if it is still a little bigger and 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:05.510
 you are too tall for the table 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:13.870
 you may find the belt still fills and 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:13.870
 here is the opposition had tires until 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.630
 in her party 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.060
 here you can also take 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.530
 but the worst is good 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.669
 all this may result in that I came 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.110
