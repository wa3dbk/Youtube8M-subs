00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.930

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.890
 Well, in general, a lot of different but 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.010
 today will tell you about the sega genesis 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 also known as the sega mega drive 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.040
 and sega mega drive 2 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 Well , click on the tab view 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.060
 games and choose the game well, let's say what 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.070
 something all let us know and aladdin 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.259
 here we have three tabs first 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 tab show more pictures i.e. 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.850
 search emulator and google search search 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.299
 emulator this is me we are looking for the emulator itself in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 play market 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.850
 there are a lot of them so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.409
 you can choose to your taste but I chose 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 gain plus droid because it's me 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.790
 liked the most but look 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.790
 maybe something to look for yourself 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.859
 and google search here we are looking for the game itself i 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.259
 I advise you if you are looking for using 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.810
 This application is always the most 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.280
 The first line of the game is proven 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 virus free and go great in general then 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.899
 I told you about this application and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.819
 I want to rate it by 5 points she 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.360
 really great and very me 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.150

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.970
 this is gene plus droid 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.349
 oh, it started right away 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:31.819

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.940

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:39.079

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.970

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.040

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.829

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.250
 childhood which I really liked and 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.069
 maybe you heard them too and maybe 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.299
 be even played by me and it's called 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.630
 rock &amp; roll racing 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:16.790
 or race powder corolla let's run 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.290
 remember it very well yes to me 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.430
 like this button above you can 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.139
 to squander it all not to watch 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.859
 just sometimes you can't click on start at 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:30.760
 she sometimes canâ€™t press start to 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.760
 skip it all 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:44.010
 let's do it like this with us 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.560
 loaded here is new game 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.820
 we choose everything absolutely the same as on 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.670
 the very prefix that I am very here yet 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.040
 like who can save 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.230
 download the game here see choose 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.230
 the very beginning of the car we just started 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.490
 here it appears that there are two thousand 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.150
 money, see what kind of car we have and 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.460
 take and load here see the button 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.350
 this safe is worth that is we can 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.220
 save louth it is worth loading here 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.120
 see on this i finished that is 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.270
 slightly different car 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.070
 more money I consider this application 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.740
 also great but what am i not here 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.840
 liked a very small image 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.860
 joystick sometimes uncomfortable with my 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.870
 with thumbs relatively sometimes 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.460
 promeryvayu and not very it turns out 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.810
 click and so the application is also gorgeous 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.240
 New seen at the very beginning 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.770
 a game that I accidentally launched but 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.770
 let's show it to you again 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.010
 This mortal kombat I think in not this 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.830
 absolutely everyone played 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.340
 we squander here in my opinion you can click 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.340
 before start 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:16.280
 Immediately I say it, I play absolutely not 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.280
 very so don't judge me harshly 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.729
 getting started 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.860
 well, at least once let hit 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.470
 Yes, I play terribly I think you think of me 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.830
 judge see how quickly played in general 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.140
 Here is such a type of games 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.120
 games a huge amount of all these games in 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.640
 who won maybe on sega 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.970
 everything is absolutely possible to download and play with 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.980
 pleasure also as you saw in 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.630
 the very beginning 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.290
 emulators have a large number then 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.630
 there is not only sega on and dandy and stuff 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.860
 That is, download what you are interested in. 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.590
 and play in general, and that's all if you 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.410
 I liked this plan 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.470
 video then put like subscribe to 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.770
 channel and write in the comments whether 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.770
 do these videos if I'm worth it 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.410
 just glad and write about that 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.170
 whether to shoot like that with a camera or 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.510
 shoot the screen itself but i think with 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:45.160
 the screen quality will be a little not 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:47.680
 so yes and somehow it won't be right anyway 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.350
 but I will listen to your opinion me she 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.050
 also very interesting in general, that's all 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.710
 if you liked everything like i already and 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.700
 said put everyone good luck to you 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.700
 bye Bye
