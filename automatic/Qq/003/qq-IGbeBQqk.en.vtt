the<00:02:03.679> pattern<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.189> little<00:02:04.880> left<00:02:05.090> he's<00:02:05.299> gonna

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
the pattern a little left he's gonna

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.179 
the pattern a little left he's gonna
chase<00:02:05.750> his<00:02:05.929> ball<00:02:06.140> motion<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.560> little<00:02:06.679> left<00:02:06.950> so

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
chase his ball motion a little left so

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.710 
chase his ball motion a little left so
just<00:02:07.369> be<00:02:07.610> aware<00:02:07.819> of<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.269> you're<00:02:08.420> watching

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
just be aware of that as you're watching

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.610 
just be aware of that as you're watching
these<00:02:08.869> shots<00:02:10.900> pretty<00:02:11.900> much<00:02:12.049> almost<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.410> same

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
MX than the HX but you can see how this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
MX than the HX but you can see how this

we<00:02:24.440> tried<00:02:24.829> to<00:02:25.209> come<00:02:26.209> up<00:02:26.360> with<00:02:26.510> some<00:02:26.900> shots<00:02:27.170> that

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
we tried to come up with some shots that

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.680 
we tried to come up with some shots that
showed<00:02:27.680> some<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.220> deficiencies<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:29.120> this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
showed some of the deficiencies of this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.330 
showed some of the deficiencies of this
ball<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.230> we<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:30.829> couldn't<00:02:31.099> find

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
ball but we really couldn't find

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.850 
ball but we really couldn't find
anything<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.880> ball<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.360> flat<00:02:33.319> out<00:02:33.349> clear

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
anything this ball just flat out clear

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.410 
anything this ball just flat out clear
the<00:02:33.980> front<00:02:34.160> part<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.519> lane<00:02:34.640> spectacular

and<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.709> went<00:02:36.890> bananas<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.489> back<00:02:37.690> this

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
and just went bananas in the back this

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.199 
and just went bananas in the back this
is<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.900> fantastic<00:02:39.890> skid<00:02:40.340> flip<00:02:40.609> ball<00:02:40.790> motion<00:02:41.120> if

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209

how<00:02:45.650> deep<00:02:45.859> he's<00:02:46.040> trying<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.430> chase<00:02:46.639> it<00:02:46.819> here

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
how deep he's trying to chase it here

and<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:47.569> can<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.720> see<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.139> deeper<00:02:48.410> he<00:02:48.470> gets

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
and you can just see the deeper he gets

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.840 
and you can just see the deeper he gets
the<00:02:48.829> sharp<00:02:49.100> where<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.250> comes<00:02:49.400> off<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.670> back<00:02:49.819> of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
all we did was just ask Joe to try and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.429

as it goes through the pins we're gonna
rewind<00:04:14.499> that<00:04:14.739> real<00:04:15.549> quick<00:04:15.819> for<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.180> just<00:04:16.870> so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
rewind that real quick for you just so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.289 
rewind that real quick for you just so
you<00:04:16.959> can<00:04:17.169> really<00:04:17.380> pay<00:04:17.590> attention<00:04:18.009> to<00:04:18.070> how

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
you can really pay attention to how

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.879 
you can really pay attention to how
sharp<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.840> ball<00:04:20.109> goes<00:04:20.320> through<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.590> pins

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
sharp this ball goes through the pins

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.370 
sharp this ball goes through the pins
and<00:04:21.160> watch<00:04:21.639> where<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:21.940> finishes<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.630> does

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and watch where it finishes just does

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.420 
and watch where it finishes just does
not<00:04:23.560> stop

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.920 

see<00:04:32.430> it's<00:04:32.580> almost<00:04:32.760> like<00:04:33.030> as<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.540> deeper<00:04:33.840> he

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
see it's almost like as the deeper he

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.890 
see it's almost like as the deeper he
goes<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:35.670> harder<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.150> ball<00:04:36.300> motion<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.780> in

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
goes the harder the ball motion is in

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.270 
goes the harder the ball motion is in
the<00:04:36.990> back<00:04:37.110> bar<00:04:37.320> line<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.680> sharper<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.100> comes

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
the back bar line the sharper it comes

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.040 
the back bar line the sharper it comes
off<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.550> end<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.790> pattern<00:04:38.970> just<00:04:39.330> slash

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
off the end of the pattern just slash

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.740 
off the end of the pattern just slash
the<00:04:40.230> ten<00:04:40.410> out<00:04:40.590> there<00:04:41.420> just<00:04:42.420> shows<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.720> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
the ten out there just shows you that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.750 
the ten out there just shows you that
this<00:04:42.990> ball<00:04:43.170> just<00:04:43.380> did<00:04:43.560> not<00:04:43.710> burn<00:04:44.010> out<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.700> the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
this ball just did not burn out in the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.700 
this ball just did not burn out in the
front<00:04:45.150> part<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.420> lane<00:04:45.570> still<00:04:46.380> had<00:04:46.500> enough

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
front part of the lane still had enough

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.080 
front part of the lane still had enough
energy<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.130> go<00:04:47.310> through<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.580> pins<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.940> right

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
energy to go through the pins the right

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.640 
energy to go through the pins the right
way<00:04:48.240> actually<00:04:48.660> too<00:04:48.840> much<00:04:49.050> leaving<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.470> nine

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
way actually too much leaving the nine
