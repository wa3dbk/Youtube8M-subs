anything<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.739> uses<00:02:13.920> energy<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:15.890> any<00:02:16.890> kind

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
anything that uses energy in a any kind

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.059 
anything that uses energy in a any kind
of<00:02:17.280> cell<00:02:17.519> uses<00:02:18.480> ATP<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.469> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.829> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
of cell uses ATP so this is a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
of cell uses ATP so this is a
fundamental<00:02:20.930> underpinning<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.049> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
fundamental underpinning in the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.830 
fundamental underpinning in the
metabolic<00:02:22.829> processes<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:24.120> life<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.659> Earth

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
metabolic processes of all life on Earth

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.789 
metabolic processes of all life on Earth
and<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.680> type<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.129> nucleic<00:02:26.459> acid<00:02:27.200> now<00:02:28.200> ATP

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
and it is a type of nucleic acid now ATP

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.710 
and it is a type of nucleic acid now ATP
looks<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.159> little<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.609> different<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
looks a little bit different because it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.289 
looks a little bit different because it
only<00:02:30.840> has<00:02:31.079> one<00:02:31.109> nucleic<00:02:31.950> acid<00:02:32.549> nitrogenous

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
only has one nucleic acid nitrogenous

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.020 
only has one nucleic acid nitrogenous
base<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:34.260> adenine<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.159> then<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.879> has<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
base the adenine and then it has a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.210 
base the adenine and then it has a
ribose<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.930> RNA<00:02:37.379> does<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.099> it's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
ribose just like RNA does and then it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.129 
ribose just like RNA does and then it's
got<00:02:38.370> those<00:02:38.549> three<00:02:38.939> phosphate<00:02:39.450> groups<00:02:39.480> instead

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
got those three phosphate groups instead

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.309 
got those three phosphate groups instead
of<00:02:40.379> just<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.689> difference

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
of just one and so the difference

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.990 
of just one and so the difference
between<00:02:43.379> ATP<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.139> RNA<00:02:46.139> is<00:02:46.379> pretty<00:02:47.010> clear<00:02:47.340> from

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
between ATP and RNA is pretty clear from

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.559 
between ATP and RNA is pretty clear from
that<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:49.069> okay<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.099> that's<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
that one okay so that's it for the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.629 
that one okay so that's it for the
biological<00:02:52.169> macromolecules<00:02:52.919> and<00:02:53.189> then<00:02:53.579> I'm

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639

what it does is

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.890 
what it does is
brings<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.020> reactance<00:04:27.620> closer<00:04:27.980> together<00:04:28.310> or

brings the reactance closer together or

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.660 
brings the reactance closer together or

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
working now enzymes have specific steps

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.580 
working now enzymes have specific steps
and<00:05:06.050> basically<00:05:07.040> you'll<00:05:07.340> see<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
and basically you'll see that the

substrates are going to join into the
active<00:05:12.590> site<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.190> then<00:05:14.150> they<00:05:14.300> bind<00:05:14.780> with<00:05:15.470> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.820 
substrate complex and this is the point
if<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.140> look<00:05:21.320> back<00:05:21.650> on<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.480> chart<00:05:23.480> that<00:05:23.830> top

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
if you look back on this chart that top

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.800 
if you look back on this chart that top

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
go either forward or backwards that is

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.630 
go either forward or backwards that is
where<00:05:29.840> it's<00:05:30.170> most<00:05:30.440> tightly<00:05:30.740> bonded<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.400> that

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
where it's most tightly bonded and that

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.460 
where it's most tightly bonded and that
is<00:05:31.790> where<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:32.300> at<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.630> enzyme<00:05:32.990> substrate

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
is where it's at the enzyme substrate

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.700 
is where it's at the enzyme substrate
complex<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:34.250> then<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.540> kicks<00:05:35.990> out<00:05:36.230> the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
complex and then it kicks out the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.330 
complex and then it kicks out the
substrates<00:05:37.610> as<00:05:38.600> products<00:05:39.350> because<00:05:39.860> it's<00:05:40.070> done

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
substrates as products because it's done

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.760 
substrates as products because it's done
something<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:41.000> them<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.330> in<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:41.930> case<00:05:42.200> it's

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
something to them and in this case it's

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.860 
something to them and in this case it's
made<00:05:43.040> pyruvate<00:05:45.160> it's<00:05:46.160> taken<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.700> phosphate<00:05:47.690> off

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
made pyruvate it's taken a phosphate off

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.090 
made pyruvate it's taken a phosphate off
of<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.380> pyruvate<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:49.220> made<00:05:49.490> it<00:05:49.640> into<00:05:49.910> ATP<00:05:50.920> okay

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
of a pyruvate and made it into ATP okay

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.850 
of a pyruvate and made it into ATP okay
and<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:52.820> then<00:05:53.780> it<00:05:53.900> kicks<00:05:54.110> out<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.320> products

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
and so then it kicks out the products

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.770 
and so then it kicks out the products
and<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.190> enzyme<00:05:55.520> is<00:05:55.670> ready<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.060> go<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.540> if<00:05:56.690> you

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
and the enzyme is ready to go and if you

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.840 
and the enzyme is ready to go and if you
look<00:05:56.990> at<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.200> shape<00:05:57.410> of<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.710> enzyme<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.580> has

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
look at the shape of the enzyme it has

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.840 
look at the shape of the enzyme it has
not<00:05:59.030> been<00:05:59.210> changed<00:05:59.270> in<00:05:59.840> any<00:05:59.960> way<00:06:00.520> when<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.670> do

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
not been changed in any way when you do

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.850 
not been changed in any way when you do
change<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.390> shape<00:06:02.630> you<00:06:02.960> denature<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.650> and

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
change the shape you denature it and

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.030 
change the shape you denature it and
here's<00:06:04.460> some<00:06:04.670> examples<00:06:04.760> a<00:06:05.480> liquid<00:06:06.110> egg<00:06:06.440> you

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
here's some examples a liquid egg you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.070 
here's some examples a liquid egg you

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
know it's liquid in the eggshell when

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.020 
know it's liquid in the eggshell when
you<00:06:09.230> cook<00:06:09.470> it<00:06:09.680> you've<00:06:10.010> added<00:06:10.220> Heat<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.760> when

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
you cook it you've added Heat and when

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.730 
you cook it you've added Heat and when
you<00:06:11.120> add<00:06:11.270> heat<00:06:11.600> it<00:06:11.810> changes<00:06:12.230> of<00:06:12.380> protein

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
you add heat it changes of protein

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.860 
you add heat it changes of protein
structures<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.430> causes<00:06:13.940> them<00:06:14.090> to<00:06:14.150> cross<00:06:14.510> link

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
structures and causes them to cross link

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.540 
structures and causes them to cross link
and<00:06:15.110> become<00:06:16.010> a<00:06:16.040> solid

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
that's denaturing the proteins similarly

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.620 
that's denaturing the proteins similarly
if<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.480> change<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:21.080> pH<00:06:21.350> of<00:06:21.860> an<00:06:22.040> enzyme<00:06:22.220> it<00:06:23.000> can

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
if you change the pH of an enzyme it can

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.320 
if you change the pH of an enzyme it can
inactivate<00:06:24.170> it<00:06:24.440> by<00:06:24.680> denaturing<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.520> if<00:06:25.700> you

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
inactivate it by denaturing it if you

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.080 
inactivate it by denaturing it if you
take<00:06:26.480> a<00:06:26.540> look<00:06:26.720> at<00:06:26.900> pepsin<00:06:27.350> and<00:06:27.500> trypsin<00:06:28.090> pepsin

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
take a look at pepsin and trypsin pepsin

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.190 
take a look at pepsin and trypsin pepsin
is<00:06:29.270> a<00:06:29.330> protein<00:06:31.060> enzyme<00:06:32.060> it<00:06:32.330> helps<00:06:33.050> to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.310 
is a protein enzyme it helps to
metabolize<00:06:33.530> proteins<00:06:34.280> and<00:06:34.580> it<00:06:35.240> only<00:06:35.420> works<00:06:36.020> in

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
metabolize proteins and it only works in

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.590 
metabolize proteins and it only works in
the<00:06:36.440> stomach<00:06:36.860> so<00:06:37.070> it<00:06:37.310> works<00:06:37.640> at<00:06:37.790> a<00:06:37.850> pH<00:06:38.150> of<00:06:38.180> two

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
the stomach so it works at a pH of two

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.269 
the stomach so it works at a pH of two
that's<00:06:39.500> its<00:06:39.770> optim

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279 
that's its optim

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:46.299 
that's its optim

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
pH trypsin helps to digest fats and so

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.479 
pH trypsin helps to digest fats and so
trypsin<00:06:46.879> and<00:06:47.029> proteins<00:06:47.749> and<00:06:47.979> trypsin<00:06:48.979> only

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:49.489 
trypsin and proteins and trypsin only

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:51.039 
trypsin and proteins and trypsin only
works<00:06:49.669> in<00:06:49.849> the<00:06:49.939> small<00:06:50.209> intestine<00:06:50.689> which<00:06:50.839> has<00:06:51.019> a

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:51.049 
works in the small intestine which has a

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:54.249 
works in the small intestine which has a
pH<00:06:51.469> of<00:06:51.499> 8<00:06:52.219> so<00:06:52.969> you<00:06:53.059> can<00:06:53.389> see<00:06:53.599> that<00:06:53.899> the<00:06:54.049> two

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:54.259 
pH of 8 so you can see that the two

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.679 
pH of 8 so you can see that the two
don't<00:06:54.859> work<00:06:55.099> in<00:06:55.309> the<00:06:55.429> other<00:06:55.639> environment

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:56.689 
don't work in the other environment

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.079 
don't work in the other environment
so<00:06:57.259> once<00:06:57.559> the<00:06:57.769> pepsin<00:06:58.219> comes<00:06:58.489> out<00:06:58.669> with<00:06:58.969> the

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.089 
so once the pepsin comes out with the

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:01.719 
so once the pepsin comes out with the
stomach<00:06:59.329> acids<00:06:59.869> it<00:07:00.229> gets<00:07:00.709> inactivated<00:07:01.219> in<00:07:01.609> the

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
stomach acids it gets inactivated in the

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.569 
stomach acids it gets inactivated in the
small<00:07:01.969> intestine<00:07:02.949> similarly<00:07:03.949> if<00:07:04.159> you<00:07:04.339> take<00:07:04.369> a

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:04.579 
small intestine similarly if you take a

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:07.719 
small intestine similarly if you take a
look<00:07:04.849> at<00:07:05.059> the<00:07:05.449> bacteria<00:07:06.429> that's<00:07:07.429> heat

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
look at the bacteria that's heat

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.169 
look at the bacteria that's heat
tolerant<00:07:08.299> its<00:07:08.989> optimal<00:07:09.919> pH<00:07:10.129> is<00:07:10.489> almost<00:07:10.789> twice

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:11.179 
tolerant its optimal pH is almost twice

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.569 
tolerant its optimal pH is almost twice
that<00:07:11.209> of<00:07:11.629> human<00:07:11.929> body<00:07:12.139> temperature<00:07:12.489> so<00:07:13.489> you

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:13.579 
that of human body temperature so you

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:16.209 
that of human body temperature so you
can<00:07:13.939> see<00:07:14.119> here<00:07:14.479> that<00:07:14.629> it's<00:07:14.839> really<00:07:15.259> got<00:07:16.189> a

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:16.219 
can see here that it's really got a

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.039 
can see here that it's really got a
completely<00:07:16.699> different<00:07:16.849> temperature<00:07:17.659> regime

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:18.049 
completely different temperature regime

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:21.699 
completely different temperature regime
then<00:07:18.889> our<00:07:19.189> normal<00:07:19.819> human<00:07:20.299> enzymes<00:07:20.809> do<00:07:21.110> because

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:21.709 
then our normal human enzymes do because

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:23.259 
then our normal human enzymes do because
they<00:07:21.829> work<00:07:22.009> at<00:07:22.159> optimal<00:07:22.579> body<00:07:22.699> temperature

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:23.269 
they work at optimal body temperature

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:27.819 
they work at optimal body temperature
which<00:07:23.959> is<00:07:24.110> 37<00:07:24.739> degrees<00:07:25.009> Celsius<00:07:26.799> okie-dokie

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:27.829 
which is 37 degrees Celsius okie-dokie

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:30.969 
which is 37 degrees Celsius okie-dokie
that<00:07:28.219> concludes<00:07:29.179> enzyme<00:07:29.869> dynamics<00:07:30.559> you<00:07:30.769> need

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:30.979 
that concludes enzyme dynamics you need

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:33.039 
that concludes enzyme dynamics you need
to<00:07:31.159> be<00:07:31.519> able<00:07:31.639> to<00:07:31.789> understand<00:07:32.389> kind<00:07:32.749> of<00:07:32.839> how<00:07:32.899> two

enzymes work we will look at labs on

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:38.769 
enzymes work we will look at labs on
that<00:07:36.979> material<00:07:37.159> and<00:07:37.759> hopefully<00:07:38.539> if<00:07:38.659> you<00:07:38.749> have

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:38.779 
that material and hopefully if you have

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.509 
that material and hopefully if you have
any<00:07:38.989> questions<00:07:39.379> see<00:07:39.649> me<00:07:39.769> during<00:07:39.919> office<00:07:40.189> hours

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:40.519 
any questions see me during office hours

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.519 
any questions see me during office hours
and<00:07:40.819> I'll<00:07:40.939> be<00:07:41.089> happy<00:07:41.329> to<00:07:41.359> help<00:07:41.539> you<00:07:41.659> have<00:07:42.469> a
