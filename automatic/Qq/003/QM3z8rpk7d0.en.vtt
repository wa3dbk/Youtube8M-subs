00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
is the first aircraft of about 16 or so

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.120 
is the first aircraft of about 16 or so
that<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.780> expect<00:01:01.200> to<00:01:01.260> receive<00:01:01.470> through<00:01:01.950> the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
that we expect to receive through the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.719 
that we expect to receive through the
calendar<00:01:02.579> year<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:03.259> 2014<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.339> over<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
calendar year of 2014 and then over the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
calendar year of 2014 and then over the
next<00:01:05.850> 10<00:01:06.420> years<00:01:06.560> or<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.130> expect<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.579> achieve

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
next 10 years or so we expect to achieve

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
next 10 years or so we expect to achieve
that<00:01:09.450> number<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> 144<00:01:11.189> aircraft<00:01:12.260> f-35<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that number of 144 aircraft f-35 is a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.910 
that number of 144 aircraft f-35 is a
fifth<00:01:14.280> generation<00:01:14.370> aircraft<00:01:15.170> 15<00:01:16.170> generation

fifth generation aircraft 15 generation

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
fifth generation aircraft 15 generation
means<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.909> bring<00:01:18.120> advanced<00:01:18.750> stealth

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
means that we bring advanced stealth

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940 
means that we bring advanced stealth
speed<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.430> gel<00:01:20.670> agility<00:01:21.390> weaponry<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
speed and a gel agility weaponry and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
speed and a gel agility weaponry and
most<00:01:23.159> importantly<00:01:23.549> an<00:01:23.700> avionic<00:01:24.270> system<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
most importantly an avionic system that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.399 
most importantly an avionic system that
fuses<00:01:25.799> its<00:01:25.950> data<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.880> give<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.960> abundant

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
fuses its data to give an abundant

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
fuses its data to give an abundant
amount<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.799> information<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> pilot<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.450> he

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
amount of information to the pilot so he

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.160 
amount of information to the pilot so he
can<00:01:30.810> employ<00:01:31.430> effectively<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> efficiently

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
can employ effectively and efficiently

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
can employ effectively and efficiently
to<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> sort<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.210> aircraft<00:01:36.210> will

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to have that sort of aircraft will

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
to have that sort of aircraft will
ensure<00:01:36.810> our<00:01:37.020> air<00:01:37.200> dominance<00:01:37.490> for<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> next<00:01:38.790> 50

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
ensure our air dominance for the next 50

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
ensure our air dominance for the next 50
years<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.630> first<00:01:39.810> half<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.260> 21st

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that in an f-16 I would have to put

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.750 
that in an f-16 I would have to put
together<00:01:56.790> myself<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:58.340> correlations<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
together myself to make correlations and

whereas<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.510> f-35<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.680> built<00:02:05.280> from

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
whereas the f-35 is really built from

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.460 
whereas the f-35 is really built from
the<00:02:05.580> ground<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:06.650> using<00:02:07.650> sensor<00:02:08.250> fusion<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:09.030> as

the ground up using sensor fusion as as
one<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> most<00:02:10.799> important<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.819> know

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
one of the most important you know

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.950 
one of the most important you know
system<00:02:12.569> concepts<00:02:13.200> overall

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.530 

it<00:02:19.530> has<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:20.160> large<00:02:20.700> motor<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it has a really large motor that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
it has a really large motor that
produces<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> lot<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.740> thrust<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:23.940> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
produces a lot of thrust so when you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.470 
produces a lot of thrust so when you
first<00:02:24.300> take<00:02:24.510> off<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.230> put<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.480> throttle

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
first take off and you put the throttle

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.040 
first take off and you put the throttle
into<00:02:27.870> afterburner<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:30.060> jet<00:02:30.510> has<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:31.020> of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
into afterburner the jet has a lot of
