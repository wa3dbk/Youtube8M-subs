do<00:00:22.170> um<00:00:22.580> i<00:00:23.580> disassembled<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.480> i<00:00:24.720> took<00:00:24.810> off

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
do um i disassembled it and i took off

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.009 
do um i disassembled it and i took off
the<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> corners<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.420> each<00:00:27.539> side<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:30.019> as

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
the all the corners on each side and as

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.650 
the all the corners on each side and as
you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:33.000> bigger

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you can see there is a little bigger

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
you can see there is a little bigger
hole<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.230> their<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> usually<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
hole than their it usually be on one of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.619 
hole than their it usually be on one of
these<00:00:36.350> 1<00:00:37.350> millimeter<00:00:37.829> space<00:00:38.100> cubes<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
these 1 millimeter space cubes so what I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.580 
these 1 millimeter space cubes so what I
did<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.410> rounded<00:00:40.649> off<00:00:41.010> corners<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
did as I rounded off corners so that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.029 
did as I rounded off corners so that
they<00:00:43.829> would<00:00:43.980> slide<00:00:44.520> past<00:00:44.820> each<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.120> better

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
they would slide past each other better

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.220 
they would slide past each other better
which<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.510> cuts<00:00:48.780> corners<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
which they do that this cuts corners a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
which they do that this cuts corners a
lot<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:52.280> um<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:54.440> also<00:00:55.440> lose<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lot better and um I also lose it and it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.670 
lot better and um I also lose it and it
turns<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:58.070> again<00:00:59.070> join<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.670> tutorial

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
turns right again join a tutorial

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.300 
turns right again join a tutorial
comment<00:01:01.680> below<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> straw<00:01:04.949> bot<00:01:07.310> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
so what I did in the edges i sanded each

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
so what I did in the edges i sanded each
side<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:23.810> 60<00:01:24.810> grit<00:01:25.970> by<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.290> all

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
side down with a 60 grit by the way all

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.069 
side down with a 60 grit by the way all
these<00:01:28.740> cubes<00:01:29.189> um<00:01:29.479> except<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.840> page

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
these cubes um except this one page

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.999 
these cubes um except this one page
makes<00:01:31.409> acto<00:01:31.770> knife<00:01:31.799> um<00:01:33.530> yeah<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.560> i<00:01:34.710> sanded

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
makes acto knife um yeah so i sanded

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
makes acto knife um yeah so i sanded
down<00:01:35.159> each<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.850> i<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> send<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> down

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
down each one and i was to send it down

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.440 
down each one and i was to send it down
the<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:36.990> imperfection<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.860> there

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
the little imperfection right there

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.550 
the little imperfection right there
corners<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.570> did<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> same<00:01:39.990> thing<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.439> was

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
corners i did the same thing there was

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.270 
corners i did the same thing there was
an<00:01:40.950> imperfection<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.380> um

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
an imperfection it there in there and um

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580 
an imperfection it there in there and um
I<00:01:44.700> signed<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.210> down<00:01:45.360> each<00:01:45.509> side<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I signed it down each side make it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.569 
I signed it down each side make it
smoother<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.380> aside<00:01:49.380> sanded<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> corner

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
smoother I aside sanded down the corner

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:59.060 
smoother I aside sanded down the corner
core<00:01:51.329> piece<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:54.020> as<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.380> result<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:57.920> turns<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
core piece and as a result it turns a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.510 
core piece and as a result it turns a
lot<00:01:59.219> better

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.190 

yeah<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.160> cue<00:02:10.670> for<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:10.970> cube<00:02:11.269> it's<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
yeah this is a cue for you cube it's a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.660 
yeah this is a cue for you cube it's a
good<00:02:12.349> mod<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:13.790> you're<00:02:14.440> cubed<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:15.650> fine<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.519> well

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
good mod if you're cubed as fine as well

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
good mod if you're cubed as fine as well
as<00:02:16.819> mine<00:02:17.060> because<00:02:18.019> I<00:02:18.230> found<00:02:19.420> first<00:02:20.420> I'll<00:02:20.540> say

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
as mine because I found first I'll say

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.470 
as mine because I found first I'll say
what<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> did<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.830> first<00:02:22.160> what<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.519> did<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.360> I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
what I did so first what I did is that I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.540 
what I did so first what I did is that I
took<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.900> edge<00:02:24.050> cap<00:02:24.349> off<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:25.160> i<00:02:25.250> sanded

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
took the edge cap off and then i sanded

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.900 
took the edge cap off and then i sanded
down<00:02:25.700> each<00:02:25.970> side<00:02:26.239> again<00:02:26.780> with<00:02:26.930> 60<00:02:27.290> great<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
down each side again with 60 great and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.570 
down each side again with 60 great and
um<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:30.440> made<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.890> lot<00:02:31.010> better<00:02:31.069> it's<00:02:31.430> an

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
um this made it a lot better it's an

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.770 
um this made it a lot better it's an
edge<00:02:34.900> um<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:37.010> turns<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.580> better<00:02:40.269> mine<00:02:41.269> is<00:02:41.540> my

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
edge um it turns a lot better mine is my

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.800 
edge um it turns a lot better mine is my
moonspeak<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.380> by<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> way<00:02:42.799> but<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.940> found
