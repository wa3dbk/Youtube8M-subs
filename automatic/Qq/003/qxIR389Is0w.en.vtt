00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 the engineers 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.380
 they break their heads designing the 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.379
 shoes so we do not have any 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.000
 ankle injury for all this 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:21.590
 we have a way to tie ourselves 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.189
 the shoes that prevents injuries and is 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.330
 comfortable to put the foot as I said 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.530
 before the foot here is very uncomfortable because 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:38.000
 that we have opened the last 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.440
 part of the boot to enter the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 stand comfortably we put the foot and then 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 we will tie 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.670
 OK 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 we continue as you can see 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.760
 This way of making shoes is very 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.670
 simple we just take the last one 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 eye 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 and we pass it continuously in parallel 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.260
 the last eye 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.870
 we pass it continuously in parallel 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.380
 the simplicity of this knot will give us 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.260
 the ease of putting on and taking out the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.430
 shoe and the assurance that we are 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.370
 respecting the design of the shoe itself 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.130
 so that we do not have any kind of 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.039
 injury 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.399
 after putting the foot comfortably 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.810
 because we have everything open we will put 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.070
 a cord for this eye and another cord for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 this eye 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.969
 when squeezing 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 by tightening what we will achieve it will be that 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:56.340
 the design that has made the mark is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 respected the foot will be completely 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 protected and then it's a simple vague 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.849
 normal and current as you can see 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.920
 this way of tying our shoes is going 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:19.200
 to give security and will give us ease 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.890
 when putting your foot inside the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.240
 shoe 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.240
 you see how easy
