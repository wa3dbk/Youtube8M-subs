00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.009
 We will introduce the unified campaign in this video 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.730
 We do various searches in every day of everyday life 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:22.250
 A place where you're just making a search 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.790
 Various situations depending on the device used for search and the timing and purpose of search 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.790
 there is 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:35.690
 For example, if you enter the pub Roppongi in the search window like this 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.270
 The search behind the same keyword has many different stories behind it 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 Let's look at some of them 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.840
 This woman is looking for a shop to go at a women's association that opens at home in the daytime at home using a tablet 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.100
 I will 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:58.370
 The place is Roppongi and seems to collect information of shops likely to be popular with women 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:02.199
 In this office, a co-worker's trio set up a welcome party next week using a company PC 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.199
 I am looking for a store to do in Roppongi 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.470
 And this woman was already in Roppongi but could not get into any store full of seats 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.940
 It seems 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.940
 We are looking for shops that are open ready-to-enter the store in the vicinity using a smart phone 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.780
 In this way, the situation is different even in the same search called tavern Roppongi 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 In particular, with the rapid spread of smartphones and tablets in recent years, the search situation has become even more pronounced. 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.229
 It is increasingly diversified multi-device of the device 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.480
 And so, such as home or office also go 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 The device is used properly according to each situation 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:51.840
 So it's important to manage multiple devices in one campaign 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.780
 A unified campaign can manage multiple devices in one campaign 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 I can do it 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.430
 In addition, we can cope with each different search needs depending on device 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.490
 Setting of advertisement for smartphone is possible 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.490
 Let's specifically compare with PC and smartphone 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:17.620
 It is when it is searched with tavern Roppongi from the left side PC 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:23.500
 In this case, there are welcome parties and private rooms for people searching from PCs indoors 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.520
 In addition, it may be considered that information comparison is being conducted in line with the purpose of the meeting, such as entertainment. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.520
 I will 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 On the other hand, in the case of the smartphone on the right side, it can be said that searching is often performed while on the move or away from home 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:43.620
 For example, if you are in urgent need of booking now or 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.890
 The feature of the search with the smart phone that there are many needs related to the place as one minute from the station 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.600
 It can be said 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:54.120
 Currently, it is good if you have selected a PC and a smartphone within one campaign 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:59.670
 The same ad will appear regardless of device 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 We can not put out the reason of advertising, such as smart phones for personal computers 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.069
 Also, if you try to divide the advertisement for each device , manage it with another campaign 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.989
 The need comes out 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:15.889
 Therefore, advertisement for PC tablet in one campaign 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.740
 It is a unified campaign that it was possible to divide and distribute advertisements for smartphones 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:23.890
 is 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:30.040
 Computers and tablets with similar search tend to show common ads 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:34.080
 Also, the unified campaign is smart based on PC tablet bid price 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.160
 It is possible to easily adjust the bid price of the phone 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:43.790
 For example, people who search with smartphones have high arrival rates 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.790
 The bid price is 10% higher than a PC. 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.700
 In other words, it has been enhanced to support multiple devices in one campaign 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.300
 campaign 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 That is a unified campaign 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:05.170
 In the unified campaign, not only device settings but also functions sequentially from summer 2013 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.170
 We plan to extend the
