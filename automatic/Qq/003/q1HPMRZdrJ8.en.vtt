that's<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:13.950> I'm<00:00:14.070> planning<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.910> for

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that's what I'm planning to do this for

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
that's what I'm planning to do this for
and<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.809> demonstrates<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.160> laws<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and it demonstrates to you the laws of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.429 
and it demonstrates to you the laws of
magnetism<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.480> electric<00:00:18.900> flow<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.350> it's

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
magnetism and electric flow and it's

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.349 
magnetism and electric flow and it's
kind<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.619> cool<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.550> value<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
kind of cool there's a lot of value to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
kind of cool there's a lot of value to
this<00:00:21.689> little<00:00:21.990> demonstration<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.699> boys

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
this little demonstration and the boys

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.730 
this little demonstration and the boys
are<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.420> love<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.590> can

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
are going to really love it so you can

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.960 
are going to really love it so you can
see<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.240> mono<00:00:27.840> polar<00:00:28.609> motor<00:00:29.609> it's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
see here this is a mono polar motor it's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
see here this is a mono polar motor it's
probably<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> most<00:00:30.840> simple<00:00:30.990> motors

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
probably one of the most simple motors

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.030 
probably one of the most simple motors
you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.619> build<00:00:31.980> basically<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> parts<00:00:33.540> are

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can build basically the parts are

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.760 
you can build basically the parts are
magnets<00:00:35.300> super-strong<00:00:36.300> magnets<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.050> double-a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
magnets super-strong magnets a double-a
battery<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> washer<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.629> top<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> some

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
battery I have a washer on top and some

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
battery I have a washer on top and some
copper<00:00:40.950> coil<00:00:41.219> running<00:00:41.640> around<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
copper coil running around and the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.029 
copper coil running around and the
forces<00:00:43.530> between<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> magnet<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> coil

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
forces between the magnet and the coil

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.910 
forces between the magnet and the coil
result<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:48.210> motor<00:00:48.899> type<00:00:49.230> movement<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
result in that motor type movement so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
result in that motor type movement so
it's<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> result<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.230> little

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it's really a lot of result for little

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
it's really a lot of result for little
effort<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.340> parts<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
effort and little parts and I'm going to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
effort and little parts and I'm going to
walk<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.300> through<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> process<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.170> put

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
walk you through the process I put

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
walk you through the process I put
together<00:00:55.829> sheet<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.520> quick<00:00:56.850> I'll<00:00:57.420> walk

you through the step step number one
we're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> cut<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> length<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.570> about

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
we're going to cut the length it's about

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
we're going to cut the length it's about
a<00:01:00.840> foot<00:01:01.050> long<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.530> copper<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> got

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
a foot long of copper and where I got

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.679 
a foot long of copper and where I got
this<00:01:03.090> copper<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.460> 14<00:01:05.460> gauge<00:01:05.729> household

this copper from is 14 gauge household

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
this copper from is 14 gauge household
wire<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.350> basically<00:01:07.500> stripped<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.189> all

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
wire I just basically stripped off all

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.359 
wire I just basically stripped off all
the<00:01:08.700> casing<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> inside<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> get

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the casing and on the inside you get

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
the casing and on the inside you get
this<00:01:11.490> nice<00:01:11.700> piece<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> copper<00:01:12.390> about<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> foot

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this nice piece of copper about a foot

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
this nice piece of copper about a foot
long<00:01:12.900> okay<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> do

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
long okay then what you're going to do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.340 
long okay then what you're going to do
is<00:01:15.979> with<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> few<00:01:17.850> pliers<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.479> few<00:01:19.170> tools

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
is with a few pliers a few tools

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.550 
is with a few pliers a few tools
actually<00:01:19.759> take<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> copper<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.479> split<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> in

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
actually take the copper and split it in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually take the copper and split it in
half<00:01:22.590> okay<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.430> bend<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> half<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.810> get

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
half okay or bend it in half you get

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
half okay or bend it in half you get
this<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.740> piece<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.960> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this little top piece right here and you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
this little top piece right here and you
crush<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:30.439> about<00:01:32.450> quarter<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> an<00:01:33.630> inch

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
crush it down about quarter of an inch

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.010 
crush it down about quarter of an inch
and<00:01:33.990> Bend<00:01:35.030> once<00:01:36.030> you've<00:01:36.180> made<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and Bend once you've made that like that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
and Bend once you've made that like that
so<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.500> step<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.700> piece

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so that's step two you make that piece

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.550 
so that's step two you make that piece
right<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
right there

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.300 
right there
step<00:01:40.909> three<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.810> case<00:01:43.049> I've<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
step three in this case I've got just a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
step three in this case I've got just a
bottle<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> perfect<00:01:45.990> shape<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
bottle that's the perfect shape here

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
bottle that's the perfect shape here
where<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:47.549> made<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> little<00:01:48.090> slit<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
where I've made a little slit there to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.899 
where I've made a little slit there to
insert<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
insert it and this is to actually get a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840 
insert it and this is to actually get a
perfect<00:01:51.450> round<00:01:51.689> form<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
perfect round form so what I do is I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
perfect round form so what I do is I
wrap<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.090> around<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.750> bottle<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
wrap it around that bottle like so and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
wrap it around that bottle like so and
if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.939> 14<00:01:57.570> gauge<00:01:57.810> wire<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
if you use 14 gauge wire you're going to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.100 
if you use 14 gauge wire you're going to
find<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.130> easy<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> bend<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.110> once

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
find it's really easy to bend this once

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.149 
find it's really easy to bend this once
you've<00:02:01.259> got<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.409> wrapped<00:02:01.710> around<00:02:01.829> there

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
you've got it wrapped around there

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760 
you've got it wrapped around there
you've<00:02:02.729> got<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> round<00:02:03.930> shape<00:02:04.229> give<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.590> take

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you've got the round shape give or take

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.609 
you've got the round shape give or take
you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.210> play<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> like

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
you can kind of just play with it like

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.089 
you can kind of just play with it like
that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.180 
that
and<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:09.300> gets<00:02:09.450> us<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.840> step<00:02:10.050> three<00:02:10.319> okay

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and that gets us to step three okay

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.080 
and that gets us to step three okay
where<00:02:11.400> we've<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> pieces<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
where we've got the pieces like that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.610 
where we've got the pieces like that
now<00:02:13.360> what<00:02:13.750> you're<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
now what you're going to do this is the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.720 
now what you're going to do this is the
trickiest<00:02:15.069> part<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.630> want<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> do<00:02:17.110> is

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
trickiest part what you want to do is

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.750 
trickiest part what you want to do is
with<00:02:18.730> these<00:02:18.880> little<00:02:18.910> bottom<00:02:19.660> pieces<00:02:20.489> kind<00:02:21.489> of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
with these little bottom pieces kind of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.330 
with these little bottom pieces kind of
bend<00:02:22.569> them<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.989> they<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.349> around<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.860> magnets

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
bend them so they go around the magnets

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.440 
bend them so they go around the magnets
at<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.489> bottom<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:25.180> I'm<00:02:25.300> going<00:02:25.420> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
at the bottom so what I'm going to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.449 
at the bottom so what I'm going to
suggest<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.709> then<00:02:27.250> bend

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
suggest is go like that and then bend

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.030 
suggest is go like that and then bend
them<00:02:27.610> back<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> curve<00:02:28.630> or<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:29.769> little

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
them back so you get a curve or a little

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.280 
them back so you get a curve or a little
dent<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.970> will<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.810> do<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
dent if you will and do that on the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.640 
dent if you will and do that on the
other<00:02:32.380> side<00:02:33.269> Bend<00:02:35.849> Bend<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.349> get

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
other side Bend Bend and you get

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.030 
other side Bend Bend and you get
something<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.190> looks<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.970> okay<00:02:40.569> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
something that looks like that okay and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.820 
something that looks like that okay and
that's<00:02:42.040> supposed<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.489> be<00:02:42.700> represented<00:02:43.830> right

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
that's supposed to be represented right

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.150 
that's supposed to be represented right
here<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.640> step<00:02:45.910> 4<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.989> step<00:02:47.230> 5<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.799> go<00:02:47.980> have

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
here and in step 4 so step 5 is go have

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.710 
here and in step 4 so step 5 is go have
some<00:02:48.340> fun<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.150> you're<00:02:49.239> going<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.690> I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
some fun so what you're going to do is I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.330 
some fun so what you're going to do is I
have<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.170> magnets<00:02:50.709> these<00:02:50.860> high-strength

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
have the magnets these high-strength

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.270 
have the magnets these high-strength
magnets<00:02:51.900> super<00:02:52.900> glue<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.440> board<00:02:53.680> or<00:02:53.950> at<00:02:54.100> in

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
magnets super glue to the board or at in

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.860 
magnets super glue to the board or at in
this<00:02:54.430> case<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.819> hot<00:02:55.060> glued<00:02:55.090> them<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.569> board

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
this case I hot glued them to the board

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.270 
this case I hot glued them to the board
and<00:02:56.110> then<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.920> magnets

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
and then you just have the magnets

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800 
and then you just have the magnets
tacked<00:02:57.519> up<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.849> there<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.630> some

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
tacked up on there just so you have some

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.780 
tacked up on there just so you have some
height<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.950> battery<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.610> put<00:03:00.760> a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
height I have a battery that I put a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.030 
height I have a battery that I put a
washer<00:03:01.299> on<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.569> top<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.769> little

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
washer on the top of just so this little

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.670 
washer on the top of just so this little
pin<00:03:03.250> ops<00:03:03.459> top<00:03:03.670> won't<00:03:03.940> fall<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.690> let's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
pin ops top won't fall out and let's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.650 
pin ops top won't fall out and let's
give<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> go<00:03:06.190> let's<00:03:06.400> see<00:03:06.549> if<00:03:06.610> my<00:03:07.000> my<00:03:07.390> first

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
give it a go let's see if my my first

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.860 
give it a go let's see if my my first
attempt<00:03:08.459> live<00:03:09.459> attempt<00:03:10.060> will<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.599> trick

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
attempt live attempt will do the trick

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.530 
attempt live attempt will do the trick
so<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.440> kind<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.799> have<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.010> sometimes<00:03:12.549> adjust

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
so you kind of have to sometimes adjust

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.229 
so you kind of have to sometimes adjust
it<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:14.049> little<00:03:14.319> bit<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> heights

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
it just a little bit so the heights

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.720 
it just a little bit so the heights
right<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.890> there's<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.040> too<00:03:21.100> much<00:03:21.340> pressure

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
right and there's not too much pressure

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.259 
right and there's not too much pressure
on<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.950> trying<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.459> go<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.790> felt<00:03:25.090> at<00:03:25.239> that

on the it's trying to go I felt at that

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.440 
on the it's trying to go I felt at that
time<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.670> there<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.420> what<00:03:31.420> I

there<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.810> see<00:03:46.959> whose<00:03:47.139> will<00:03:47.560> go<00:03:47.650> spin<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
there and see whose will go spin the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.530 
there and see whose will go spin the
fastest<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.639> can<00:03:48.760> kind<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.030> adjust<00:03:49.389> them

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
fastest and you can kind of adjust them

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.289 
fastest and you can kind of adjust them
and<00:03:49.630> tune<00:03:49.840> them<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.560> they'll<00:03:50.769> go<00:03:51.310> faster<00:03:51.819> you

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
and tune them so they'll go faster you

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.270 
and tune them so they'll go faster you
can<00:03:52.420> adjust<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.260> center<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.650> balance<00:03:53.920> here

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
can adjust the center of balance here

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.819 
can adjust the center of balance here
the<00:03:54.459> where<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.569> everything's<00:03:56.170> smooth<00:03:56.500> and

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
the where so everything's smooth and

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.860 
the where so everything's smooth and
balanced<00:03:57.280> over<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.120> spinning<00:03:58.569> parts

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
balanced over on the the spinning parts

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.199 
balanced over on the the spinning parts
of<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.019> motor<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.709> great<00:03:59.920> result<00:04:00.209> but

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
of the motor you get a great result but

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.000 
of the motor you get a great result but
anyway<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.079> nutshell<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.590> kind<00:04:02.950> of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
anyway in a nutshell that's kind of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.860 
anyway in a nutshell that's kind of
something<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.370> start<00:04:03.609> with<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:04.090> might<00:04:04.600> be<00:04:04.780> in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
something to start with I might be in

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.539 
something to start with I might be in
