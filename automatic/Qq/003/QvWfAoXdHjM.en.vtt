00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we've been very fun of this bike for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
we've been very fun of this bike for
many<00:00:40.980> reasons<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.550> we've<00:00:42.360> stuck<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> for

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
a long time and then we started off with

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
a long time and then we started off with
150<00:00:45.450> ml<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.020> thought<00:00:46.170> we'd<00:00:46.320> try<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> 160

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
150 ml for and we thought we'd try a 160

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.810 
150 ml for and we thought we'd try a 160
stuck<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.149> went<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> 150<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.820> realize

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
stuck it out went back to 150 to realize

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.220 
stuck it out went back to 150 to realize
his<00:00:50.910> full<00:00:51.000> potential<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.020> thought

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
his full potential it's a you thought

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
his full potential it's a you thought

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
a very bad idea

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
least a while I mean yeah it made it may

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.250 
least a while I mean yeah it made it may
do<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.489> years<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> come<00:02:45.820> but<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:47.050> now<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.600 
do in years to come but for now the
yetis<00:02:47.530> plan<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.860> definitely<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.280> keep<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
yetis plan is definitely to keep it as a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.830 
yetis plan is definitely to keep it as a
26<00:02:49.030> inch<00:02:49.180> bike<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:49.660> certainly

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
26 inch bike and that's certainly

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.150 
26 inch bike and that's certainly
another<00:02:50.350> aspect<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.860> really<00:02:51.040> love<00:02:51.130> about

bar<00:03:19.569> with<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.870> slightly<00:03:20.049> shorter<00:03:20.319> stem<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.950> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
bar with a slightly shorter stem it's a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.309 
bar with a slightly shorter stem it's a
good<00:03:21.489> go<00:03:21.610> good<00:03:21.849> fierce<00:03:22.150> temper<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.510> could<00:03:22.870> be

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
good go good fierce temper that could be

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.880 
good go good fierce temper that could be
interesting<00:03:23.830> yeah<00:03:25.440> we'll<00:03:26.440> look<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> bike

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
interesting yeah we'll look with a bike

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.309 
interesting yeah we'll look with a bike
that's<00:03:27.129> so<00:03:27.629> confidence-inspiring<00:03:28.629> like<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
that's so confidence-inspiring like the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.740 
that's so confidence-inspiring like the
frame<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.709> very<00:03:29.860> stiff<00:03:30.099> laterally<00:03:30.700> push<00:03:31.599> it

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
frame it's very stiff laterally push it

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.559 
frame it's very stiff laterally push it
really<00:03:31.840> hard<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.709> no<00:03:32.890> point<00:03:33.160> putting

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
really hard there is no point putting

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.729 
really hard there is no point putting
you<00:03:34.569> know<00:03:34.690> components<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.290> don't<00:03:35.500> match

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
you know components that don't match

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.650 
you know components that don't match
those<00:03:35.980> frames<00:03:36.370> stability<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:37.420> what<00:03:37.569> we've

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
those frames stability so what we've

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.630 
those frames stability so what we've
gone<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.410> set<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.890> all<00:03:39.069> mountain<00:03:39.400> style

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
gone for is a set of all mountain style

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.670 
gone for is a set of all mountain style
wheels<00:03:39.880> I've<00:03:40.299> gone<00:03:40.510> for<00:03:40.720> like<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.440> quite<00:03:41.650> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
wheels I've gone for like a quite a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.589 
wheels I've gone for like a quite a
meaty<00:03:41.980> tire<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> stiff<00:03:42.819> sidewall<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.450> I'm

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
meaty tire with a stiff sidewall and I'm

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.330 
meaty tire with a stiff sidewall and I'm
running<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.930> pressure<00:03:44.140> Duff<00:03:44.440> drop<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.160> tire

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
running a pressure Duff drop the tire

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.460 
running a pressure Duff drop the tire
pressure<00:03:45.640> down<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.239> low<00:03:46.480> 20s<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.290> nice

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
pressure down to the low 20s and a nice

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.039 
pressure down to the low 20s and a nice
big<00:03:47.799> leg<00:03:48.069> for<00:03:48.370> focus<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:48.819> if<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.690> new<00:03:49.840> rock

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
big leg for focus is if the new rock

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.000 
big leg for focus is if the new rock
rock<00:03:50.230> bike<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.250> 35<00:03:52.150> or<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.540> mill<00:03:52.930> fork<00:03:53.230> leg<00:03:53.709> so

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
rock bike is a 35 or so mill fork leg so

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.530 
rock bike is a 35 or so mill fork leg so
it's<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.340> either<00:03:54.579> be<00:03:54.700> bigger<00:03:54.879> than<00:03:55.060> your<00:03:55.180> carves

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
it's a either be bigger than your carves

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.690 
it's a either be bigger than your carves
it<00:03:56.440> has<00:03:56.560> massive<00:03:59.129> now<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.220> switch<00:04:00.489> technology

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
it has massive now the switch technology

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.479 
it has massive now the switch technology
is<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.629> suspension<00:04:02.230> system<00:04:02.709> that<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.250> used<00:04:03.400> on

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
is the suspension system that is used on

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.589 
is the suspension system that is used on
this<00:04:03.610> bike<00:04:03.790> was<00:04:03.970> announced<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.390> lots<00:04:04.540> of

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
this bike was announced to lots of

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.220 
this bike was announced to lots of
fanfare<00:04:05.160> fancy<00:04:06.160> graphics<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.639> riders<00:04:07.230> switch

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
fanfare fancy graphics and riders switch

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.270 
fanfare fancy graphics and riders switch
technology<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:11.319> essentially<00:04:11.769> what<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.069> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
technology and essentially what it is is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.160 
technology and essentially what it is is
an<00:04:12.489> eccentric<00:04:12.790> pivot<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.720> changes

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
an eccentric pivot that changes

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.720 
an eccentric pivot that changes
direction<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.950> bike<00:04:15.100> moves<00:04:15.400> through<00:04:15.639> his

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
direction as the bike moves through his

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.360 
direction as the bike moves through his
travel<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:16.090> eccentric<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.630> does<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.370> like

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
travel in eccentric it does this like

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.539 
travel in eccentric it does this like
that<00:04:18.870> also<00:04:19.870> yeah<00:04:20.620> well<00:04:20.829> what<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.430> does

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
that also yeah well what it does

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.620 
that also yeah well what it does
essentially<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.210> increases<00:04:22.539> the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
essentially is it increases the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.960 
essentially is it increases the
chainstay<00:04:22.930> linked<00:04:23.260> at<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:24.160> early<00:04:24.700> part<00:04:24.729> of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
chainstay linked at the early part of

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.810 
chainstay linked at the early part of
the<00:04:25.060> travel<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.960> then<00:04:26.320> which<00:04:27.160> which<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.550> great

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
the travel and then which which is great

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.740 
the travel and then which which is great
because<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.150> adds<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> little<00:04:28.389> bit<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:28.570> chain

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
because it adds a little bit of chain

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.570 
because it adds a little bit of chain
tension<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.349> arm<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.130> way<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
tension to the arm to the way the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.100 
tension to the arm to the way the
suspension<00:04:30.970> performs<00:04:31.240> which<00:04:31.360> gives<00:04:31.539> a<00:04:31.630> bit

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
suspension performs which gives a bit

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.510 
suspension performs which gives a bit
better<00:04:32.260> acceleration<00:04:32.560> or<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.070> bit<00:04:33.190> more<00:04:33.220> our

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
better acceleration or a bit more our

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.940 
better acceleration or a bit more our
anti-squat

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
anti-squat

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.779 
anti-squat
when<00:04:35.950> you're<00:04:36.099> when<00:04:36.280> you're<00:04:36.310> laying<00:04:36.490> down<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
when you're when you're laying down the

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.250 
when you're when you're laying down the
power<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.150> start<00:04:37.389> of<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.510> travel<00:04:37.780> then<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.110> it

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
power and start of the travel then as it

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.629 
power and start of the travel then as it
moves<00:04:38.470> deeper<00:04:38.889> into<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.099> travel<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.370> switch

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
moves deeper into the travel the switch

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.719 
moves deeper into the travel the switch
changes<00:04:40.389> direction<00:04:41.020> which<00:04:41.830> gives<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.340> nice<00:04:42.460> and

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
changes direction which gives a nice and

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.250 
changes direction which gives a nice and
vertical<00:04:42.849> wheel<00:04:43.240> path<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:43.660> keeps<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
vertical wheel path that keeps the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.529 
vertical wheel path that keeps the
distance<00:04:44.590> between<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.490> dropouts<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
distance between the dropouts and the

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.510 
distance between the dropouts and the
crankset<00:04:46.870> more<00:04:47.050> consistent<00:04:47.500> which<00:04:48.039> means<00:04:48.430> you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
crankset more consistent which means you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.850 
crankset more consistent which means you
don't<00:04:48.639> get<00:04:48.760> as<00:04:48.849> much<00:04:48.970> chain<00:04:49.660> target

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
don't get as much chain target

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.490 
don't get as much chain target
deeper<00:04:51.310> into<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.580> travel<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.840> allow<00:04:53.289> us<00:04:53.379> to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
deeper into the travel and allow us to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.540 
deeper into the travel and allow us to
roll<00:04:53.680> through<00:04:53.830> those<00:04:53.919> bigger<00:04:54.129> hits<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.370> little

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
roll through those bigger hits a little

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.830 
roll through those bigger hits a little
bit<00:04:54.639> better<00:04:54.759> also<00:04:55.180> allows<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.360> keep<00:04:55.629> quite<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
bit better also allows to keep quite a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.820 
bit better also allows to keep quite a
short<00:04:55.990> chain<00:04:56.199> stay<00:04:56.379> because<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.590> don't<00:04:56.740> have

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
short chain stay because you don't have

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.520 
short chain stay because you don't have
to<00:04:56.889> fit<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.039> link<00:04:57.250> in<00:04:57.340> there<00:04:57.490> okay<00:04:57.940> I<00:04:58.419> guess<00:04:59.379> just

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
to fit a link in there okay I guess just

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.330
