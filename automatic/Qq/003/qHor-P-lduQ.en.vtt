My name's Sujata Patil. I'm showing you how to make Bharli Vangi

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:19.852
Though I've studied and specialised in French language, 
 I still love my mother tongue Marathi

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:23.627
And love to cook my family recipes

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.620
These are special brinjal called Gauti or village brinjal. 
 They've got thorns on the head 

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:36.464
You can substitute this with the regular small brinjal

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.490
We wash the brinjal and make four slits without cutting through and through

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:56.202
Now we ready the stuffing with grated coconut

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:05.656
Finely chopped onion

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:15.975
Goda masala which's a special Maharashtrian spice mix

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.950
And salt

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.490
We mix this and stuff the brinjal

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.359
We also add some jaggery to the mixture

00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:45.010
And stuff the brinjal

00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:45.010
And stuff the brinjal

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:46.910
And stuff the brinjal

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.700
We heat oil in a vessel

00:02:30.188 --> 00:02:36.190
Once the oil becomes hot, we add the brinjal and remaining masala to this

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.910
Add a bit of water

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:11.650
Now we cover with a lid and cook for around 10 minutes

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.960
The Bharli Vangi's now cooked
