activate<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> failure<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.910> tried<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
activate the failure and that I tried to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.440

start<00:00:24.480> yet

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.170
