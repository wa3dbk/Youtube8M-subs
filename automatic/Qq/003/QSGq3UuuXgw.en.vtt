00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
around there I mean throughout the whole

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.229 
around there I mean throughout the whole
game<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.440> whole<00:00:43.620> lifetime<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> dragons<00:00:44.969> story

game the whole lifetime of dragons story
the<00:00:46.020> price<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.700> guess<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.239> went<00:00:48.390> up

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the price is like I guess they went up

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.119 
the price is like I guess they went up
like<00:00:48.750> three<00:00:49.050> times<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.920> bad

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
like three times so I think it's bad

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.770 
like three times so I think it's bad
that's<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> say<00:00:54.539> but

fairy dragon and the light dragon

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
fairy dragon and the light dragon
basically<00:01:41.280> anything<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.329> those<00:01:42.689> three

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
basically anything just with those three

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
basically anything just with those three
colors<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.610> anything<00:01:44.820> else<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
colors it can be anything else but it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.050 
colors it can be anything else but it
kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.710> four<00:01:47.430> colors<00:01:47.850> too

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
kind of it kind of like four colors too

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960 
kind of it kind of like four colors too
but<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.110> three<00:01:49.409> colors<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.950> always<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.729> best

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but the three colors are always the best

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.230 
but the three colors are always the best
because<00:01:52.130> you're<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.340> focusing<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.000> getting

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
because you're just focusing on getting

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.139 
because you're just focusing on getting
those<00:01:54.509> colors<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:56.579> breeding<00:01:56.880> time<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
those colors so the breeding time is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.810 
those colors so the breeding time is
gonna<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.360> 23<00:01:57.719> hours<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.460> that's<00:01:59.460> gonna<00:01:59.640> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
gonna be 23 hours and that's gonna be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.319 
gonna be 23 hours and that's gonna be
the<00:01:59.939> hatching<00:02:00.329> time<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.719> well<00:02:02.030> once<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> hatch

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the hatching time as well once you hatch

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
the hatching time as well once you hatch
the<00:02:03.600> dragon<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> into<00:02:04.649> any<00:02:04.890> light

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the dragon you can put it into any light

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.619 
the dragon you can put it into any light
habitat<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.450> air<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:09.300> green

stage<00:02:46.030> okay<00:02:47.030> I'm<00:02:47.120> gonna<00:02:47.239> evolve<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.690> right<00:02:47.840> now

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
stage okay I'm gonna evolve it right now

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.420 
stage okay I'm gonna evolve it right now
so<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> takes<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.989> evolution<00:02:51.620> time<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.980> 23

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so it takes a the evolution time is 23

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.180 
so it takes a the evolution time is 23
hours<00:02:52.459> too<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.450> yeah<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> same<00:02:54.860> as<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
hours too so yeah it's the same as the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.400 
hours too so yeah it's the same as the
breathing<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.760> hatching<00:02:56.120> time<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:57.110> here<00:02:57.320> we
