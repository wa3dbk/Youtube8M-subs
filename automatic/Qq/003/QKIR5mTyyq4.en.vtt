00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.360
 hello girls I hope you are very 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.360
 all right 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.340
 It's been a while since I posted video 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.490
 Well, I'm here again with a mini 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.330
 I loved it and the truth is that it 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.900
 I want to show are very very beautiful and the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.460
 theme from peacocks and well then it 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.559
 is going to move the camera a little bit 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.180
 because I want to do some 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.509
 approaches then it's going to move a 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.509
 bit 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.300
 good on the cover has several flowers 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.380
 and some are prime flowers others are 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.570
 flowers that I made with a ribbon has 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.730
 many details many little details and 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.330
 very bright and I loved the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.330
 result here because some have 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.650
 other chaquiras have these in brax with 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.170
 with a lot of brightness they have spangle 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.449
 has this butterfly metal that 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.269
 It made me very pretty and good because it has 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.269
 this electrolyte that we can put 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.450
 some phrase or the name of the person to 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.490
 which for what is going to be the album and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 well here I put this provisional for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.930
 to see what can be taken out and put with 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.790
 ease also to decorate I put this 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.770
 pen that I loved that I was made 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.800
 super pretty that is a feather 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.280
 pavorreal 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.670
 and they have some accounts and some 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.830
 pearls in the rings I always put a lot 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.220
 very smart but this time he only has 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.980
 this bow with an organza ribbon I think 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.650
 which is organza and now I put this 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.410
 llaverito that is a feather also of 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.960
 metal for a burger is super 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.670
 pretty this garment I love also I know 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 very pretty this mini has many 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 little details like that and that's why I 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 loved the result and well let's go 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.890
 to see it is an album in sonar very is 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 dynamic because it has a lot of movement 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.720
 in each of the pages for example 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.700
 this page the first page here is 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.740
 can put a picture and hold 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.750
 perfect with this ribbon or we can 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.090
 paste and it opens is a folder cited and in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.480
 every page where we can also 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.550
 place a photograph and hold it and in 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.490
 this side also has some 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.080
 pockets where we can stick more 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.740
 Photographs 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.960
 write write and here also they 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.940
 I say that there is another photograph more and here 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.260
 another one and each one has a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.510
 different pocket 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.510
 then they can be removed perfectly 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.300
 I'm holding a camera and good 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 well so on the next page you have 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.400
 details also very nice this ribbon 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.239
 I really like it a lot 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.620
 the flowers that she has I love and good 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.830
 only that stood 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.129
 of detail on the page since the the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.959
 sheet in the design is very nice the 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.010
 flowers that are below are very beautiful 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.700
 and here I put this back he also quoted that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.519
 one opens up and one towards 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.750
 down these spaces for here are for 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.799
 photographs and also everyone has a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.010
 pocket where we can also write 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:39.390
 or we can place more pictures inside 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:43.319
 And this is a matter of imagination where 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.480
 they want to put the pictures and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.640
 it seems that the album has nothing 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.700
 more a space the best thing out here 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.450
 to put pictures but you can not 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.670
 put pictures inside too 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.060
 and in the pockets this page then 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.540
 It also has many flowers and has there 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.250
 some bright details and good 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.709
 let's move on to the next page this 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.780
 it's from my favorite pages because this 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.769
 paper I loved that they are some feathers 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.739
 pavorreal white with purple and me 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.540
 he did super nice is a pocket is a 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.410
 pocket and in I crossed some tags 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.690
 labels where you can put pictures 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 You can put pictures and I put them as 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.760
 decoration this this pebble is at 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.100
 reverse this pebble in green and 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.790
 this more 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.710
 it was very nice 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.360
 and here I set a bar more than what they 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.730
 I say but now in purple so that 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.380
 contrast in the color green and with what 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.180
 little purple that has here 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.460
 and we go to the next page to the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.140
 next page is also very nice to 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.860
 I loved the paper that is underneath 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.990
 that is a very nice peacock and not 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.050
 I wanted to cover it so much that the pocket 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.870
 I did it with acetate so that it could be 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.740
 see the peacock below and here I placed 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.750
 the pen and it looks like it's a 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.540
 pen of the same peacock that is here 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.540

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.250
