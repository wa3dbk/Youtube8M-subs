juggling in this tutorial I will be
teaching<00:00:13.129> you<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:13.879> fundamentals<00:00:14.839> of<00:00:14.960> a

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
teaching you the fundamentals of a

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.210 
teaching you the fundamentals of a
scissor<00:00:16.129> catch<00:00:17.410> upon<00:00:18.410> mastering<00:00:19.009> these

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
scissor catch upon mastering these

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.089 
scissor catch upon mastering these
fundamentals<00:00:19.939> you<00:00:20.540> will<00:00:20.660> open<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.259> door<00:00:21.500> to

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
fundamentals you will open the door to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:33.270 
fundamentals you will open the door to
the<00:00:22.220> broad<00:00:22.610> category<00:00:23.270> of<00:00:23.570> scissor<00:00:23.899> Theory

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.250 

first<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.460> all<00:00:34.579> there<00:00:35.059> are<00:00:35.210> two<00:00:35.260> different

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
first of all there are two different

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.780 
first of all there are two different
parts<00:00:36.469> of<00:00:36.829> any<00:00:37.460> scissor<00:00:38.120> catch<00:00:39.310> the<00:00:40.310> scissored

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
parts of any scissor catch the scissored

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.189 
parts of any scissor catch the scissored
club<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:43.220> scissor<00:00:43.550> grip

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.229 

the<00:00:51.199> scissor<00:00:51.469> grip<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.190> very<00:00:52.610> important<00:00:53.120> and

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
the scissor grip is very important and

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.720 
the scissor grip is very important and
there<00:00:53.840> are<00:00:53.870> two<00:00:54.230> fundamentally<00:00:55.190> different

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
there are two fundamentally different

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.450 
there are two fundamentally different
ways<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.390> hold<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.750> club<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.120> regular

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
ways to hold the club this is regular

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:12.600 
ways to hold the club this is regular
the<00:01:01.460> alternative<00:01:02.000> is<00:01:03.009> circus<00:01:05.320> regular<00:01:07.810> circus

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.980 

the<00:01:13.610> difference<00:01:14.030> between<00:01:14.210> these<00:01:14.540> two<00:01:14.750> grips

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
the difference between these two grips

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.780 
the difference between these two grips
is<00:01:15.229> subtle<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.250> we're<00:01:16.369> going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.520> take<00:01:16.759> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
is subtle so we're going to take a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.789 
is subtle so we're going to take a
closer<00:01:17.149> look<00:01:17.299> at<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.810> from<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.350> jugglers
