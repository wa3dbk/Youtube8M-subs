00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
actually reaches the end user we started

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.070 
actually reaches the end user we started
out<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.489> cf-29<00:02:30.120> s<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> couple<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.050> years

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
out with the cf-29 s a couple of years

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.979 
out with the cf-29 s a couple of years
ago<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.920> were<00:02:31.950> great<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.430> never<00:02:32.580> failed

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
ago they were great they never failed

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.479 
ago they were great they never failed
and<00:02:33.989> we're<00:02:34.170> now<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.530> cf-30<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> only

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
and we're now on the cf-30 the only

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.280 
and we're now on the cf-30 the only
reason<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.030> changed<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:37.019> we<00:02:37.140> one

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
reason that we changed is because we one

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.130 
reason that we changed is because we one
of<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> upgraded<00:02:38.250> processing<00:02:39.209> power<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:40.019> our

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of the upgraded processing power for our

bit of CPU power we're basically use the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.160

initial investment of a toughbook may be
a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.120> more<00:03:21.450> than<00:03:21.780> your<00:03:22.080> traditional

a little more than your traditional

definitely pay off in the long run the

definitely pay off in the long run the

they<00:03:33.780> let<00:03:34.410> us<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.680> where<00:03:34.860> we<00:03:34.980> want<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.280> if

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
they let us know where we want to go if

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.960 
they let us know where we want to go if
that<00:03:36.480> falls<00:03:36.720> over<00:03:37.140> basically<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.700> little

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
that falls over basically this little

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.280 
that falls over basically this little
point<00:03:39.210> in<00:03:39.240> that's<00:03:39.420> getting<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:39.780> off<00:03:40.050> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
point in that's getting up off the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.420 
point in that's getting up off the
ground<00:03:40.380> because<00:03:40.800> we<00:03:40.920> don't<00:03:41.100> know<00:03:41.160> where<00:03:41.280> we're

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
ground because we don't know where we're

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.970 
ground because we don't know where we're
going<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.610> go<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:42.810> basically<00:03:43.170> are<00:03:43.320> available

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
going to go we basically are available

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
going to go we basically are available
24<00:03:44.130> 7<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.300> these<00:03:45.990> computers<00:03:46.530> never<00:03:46.740> get<00:03:46.920> turned

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
24 7 so these computers never get turned

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.160 
24 7 so these computers never get turned
