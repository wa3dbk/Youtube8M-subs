riding a good to really know it's you're
watching<00:04:49.050> I'll<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.260> around<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> top<00:04:50.770> make

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
watching I'll and around the top make

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.480 
watching I'll and around the top make
that<00:04:51.190> board

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
that board

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.550 
that board
well<00:04:52.180> single<00:04:52.630> file<00:04:52.870> but<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.169> were<00:04:53.320> just

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
well single file but you were just

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.719 
well single file but you were just
starting<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.889> mix<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.190> up<00:04:54.280> what<00:04:54.490> were<00:04:54.580> you

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
starting to mix it up what were you

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.580 
starting to mix it up what were you
finding<00:04:55.060> as<00:04:55.210> far<00:04:55.419> as<00:04:55.600> Dyson<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.410> other

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
finding as far as Dyson with the other

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.020 
finding as far as Dyson with the other
car<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.010> lead<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.520> could<00:04:57.639> all<00:04:57.729> run<00:04:57.880> at

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
car to the lead so we could all run at

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.390 
car to the lead so we could all run at
the<00:04:58.120> top<00:04:58.300> single<00:04:58.660> file<00:04:59.070> that's<00:05:00.070> all<00:05:00.250> we're

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
the top single file that's all we're

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.879 
the top single file that's all we're
trying<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.669> do<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:01.060> don't<00:05:01.780> think<00:05:02.080> it's<00:05:02.200> where<00:05:02.800> it

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
trying to do I don't think it's where it

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.560 
trying to do I don't think it's where it
needs<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.130> be<00:05:03.220> right<00:05:03.430> now<00:05:03.669> there's<00:05:04.030> obviously

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
needs to be right now there's obviously

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.790 
needs to be right now there's obviously
probably<00:05:04.810> another<00:05:05.140> way<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.350> get<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.650> package

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
probably another way to get the package

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.340 
probably another way to get the package
to<00:05:06.100> do<00:05:06.220> better<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.390> not<00:05:07.450> necessarily<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.140> co

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
to do better it's not necessarily the co

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.710 
to do better it's not necessarily the co
G<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.860> just<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.250> correlation<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.270> Wicker

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
G is just the correlation of the Wicker

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.930 
G is just the correlation of the Wicker
the<00:05:11.350> plate<00:05:11.860> probably<00:05:12.100> just<00:05:12.460> getting<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.730> right

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
the plate probably just getting a right

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.420 
the plate probably just getting a right
combination<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.780> know<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:15.070> this

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
combination and you know this is this

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.510 
combination and you know this is this
they<00:05:15.760> didn't<00:05:16.000> have<00:05:16.120> any<00:05:16.270> IRA<00:05:16.510> prior<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.370> do<00:05:18.370> you

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
they didn't have any IRA prior I do you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.040 
they didn't have any IRA prior I do you
have<00:05:18.610> how<00:05:18.760> this<00:05:18.910> is<00:05:19.030> gonna<00:05:19.090> go<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.900> know<00:05:19.990> we

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
have how this is gonna go so you know we

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.360 
have how this is gonna go so you know we
