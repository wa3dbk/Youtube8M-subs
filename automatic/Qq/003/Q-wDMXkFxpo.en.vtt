want to blend it's really actually the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.960 
want to blend it's really actually the
most<00:02:38.910> densely<00:02:39.540> packed<00:02:39.810> um<00:02:40.700> angled<00:02:41.700> brush<00:02:41.820> that

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
most densely packed um angled brush that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.390 
most densely packed um angled brush that
I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.440> another<00:02:43.739> Sedona<00:02:44.160> lease

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400

I have and I have another Sedona lease
one<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.079> is<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
one and I think that that one is a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.800 
one and I think that that one is a
natural<00:02:46.739> high<00:02:46.890> rush<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:48.630> soft

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
natural high rush and it's not as soft

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.390 
natural high rush and it's not as soft
as<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.920> extraordinarily

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
as this one this is just extraordinarily

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.840 
as this one this is just extraordinarily
soft<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.739> really<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.579> brushy

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
soft I really like this little brushy

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.620 
soft I really like this little brushy
this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.870> wrong<00:02:55.110> tap<00:02:55.470> powder<00:02:55.829> brush<00:02:56.630> this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
this is the wrong tap powder brush this

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.039 
this is the wrong tap powder brush this
looks<00:02:58.110> like<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.459> very<00:03:00.060> densely<00:03:00.720> packed

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
looks like it's a very densely packed

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.440 
looks like it's a very densely packed
brush<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.070> definitely<00:03:02.310> get<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> nice

looking<00:03:06.780> too<00:03:07.140> overwhelming<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
looking too overwhelming and because it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.069

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
see they have a very short handle and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.309 
see they have a very short handle and
they<00:03:44.550> actually<00:03:44.879> did<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.269> purpose
