so<00:03:53.720> there's<00:03:53.870> another<00:03:54.019> part<00:03:54.380> that<00:03:54.530> kept<00:03:54.680> me

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
so there's another part that kept me

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.650 
so there's another part that kept me

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
it's hard to tell because the switch

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.979 
it's hard to tell because the switch
looks<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.700> much<00:04:04.849> like<00:04:04.910> it's<00:04:05.269> just<00:04:05.389> an<00:04:05.510> ambien

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
looks so much like it's just an ambien

part of the background that you know

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:08.949 
part of the background that you know
it's<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.849> little<00:04:08.060> difficult<00:04:08.419> to<00:04:08.450> tell<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.870> it

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
it's a little difficult to tell that it

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.750 
it's a little difficult to tell that it
actually<00:04:09.109> has<00:04:09.410> any<00:04:09.709> sort<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.099> influence<00:04:10.639> in

City<00:05:20.870> kind<00:05:21.289> of<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.470> short<00:05:21.770> video<00:05:21.949> but<00:05:22.370> actually

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
City kind of a short video but actually

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.839 
City kind of a short video but actually
I<00:05:23.389> don't<00:05:23.570> think<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:24.199> game<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:25.340> bad<00:05:25.820> I

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
I don't think this game is that bad I

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.570 
I don't think this game is that bad I
mean<00:05:26.300> certainly<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.740> little<00:05:27.949> bit<00:05:28.070> insane

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
mean certainly it's a little bit insane

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.670 
mean certainly it's a little bit insane
and<00:05:29.050> probably<00:05:30.050> people<00:05:30.199> would<00:05:30.440> have<00:05:30.530> just

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
and probably people would have just

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.080 
and probably people would have just
preferred<00:05:30.949> having<00:05:31.190> Michael<00:05:31.370> Jordan<00:05:31.820> in<00:05:31.940> a

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
preferred having Michael Jordan in a

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.589 
preferred having Michael Jordan in a
basketball<00:05:32.720> game<00:05:33.130> because<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:35.180> was<00:05:35.300> always<00:05:35.479> a

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
basketball game because it was always a

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.300 
basketball game because it was always a
pain<00:05:35.930> in<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.050> ass<00:05:36.199> he<00:05:36.380> played<00:05:36.560> like<00:05:36.710> NBA<00:05:36.979> Jam

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
pain in the ass he played like NBA Jam
