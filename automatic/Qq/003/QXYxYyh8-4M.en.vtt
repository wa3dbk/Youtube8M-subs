00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
you got this stainless steel flame tamer

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.770 
you got this stainless steel flame tamer
that<00:02:03.680> helps<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.250> sizzle<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.120> drippings<00:02:05.570> as

that helps to sizzle the drippings as

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.210 
that helps to sizzle the drippings as
they<00:02:05.960> fall<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.590> give<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:06.950> smoked

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
notice how it's angled so it's helping

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.030 
notice how it's angled so it's helping
the<00:02:11.330> drippings<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.900> get<00:02:12.050> channeled<00:02:12.500> away<00:02:12.770> from

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the drippings to get channeled away from

the<00:03:58.430> infrared<00:03:58.970> rotisserie<00:03:59.660> system<00:04:00.200> you're

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the infrared rotisserie system you're

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.920 
the infrared rotisserie system you're
all<00:04:00.920> going<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> start<00:04:01.610> with<00:04:02.329> your<00:04:02.540> infrared

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
all going to start with your infrared

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.350 
all going to start with your infrared
back<00:04:03.380> burner<00:04:03.709> here's<00:04:04.100> your<00:04:04.370> ceramic<00:04:04.910> infrared

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
back burner here's your ceramic infrared

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.270 
back burner here's your ceramic infrared
burner<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:05.810> like<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.650> burner<00:04:06.860> always

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
burner just like the burner always

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.070 
burner just like the burner always
showing<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.360> use<00:04:08.540> under

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
showing you that you use under

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.370 
showing you that you use under
it's<00:04:10.070> located<00:04:10.490> behind<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.330> rotisserie<00:04:12.170> spit

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
it's located behind the rotisserie spit

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.870 
it's located behind the rotisserie spit
so<00:04:12.770> that<00:04:12.920> it's<00:04:13.070> going<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.310> provide<00:04:13.640> an

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
so that it's going to provide an

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.150 
so that it's going to provide an
indirect<00:04:14.390> heat<00:04:14.630> not<00:04:15.350> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> dry<00:04:15.920> out<00:04:16.130> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
indirect heat not going to dry out the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.880 
indirect heat not going to dry out the
food<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.790> you're<00:04:16.970> cooking<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.049> spin<00:04:18.320> and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
food that you're cooking on the spin and

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.949 
food that you're cooking on the spin and
it's<00:04:19.220> infrared<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.360> gives<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.780> good

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
it's infrared so it gives you a good

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's infrared so it gives you a good
radiant<00:04:21.500> heat<00:04:21.709> so<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.190> cooks<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.670> even<00:04:23.090> now

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
radiant heat so it cooks it even now

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.930 
radiant heat so it cooks it even now
this<00:04:24.230> is<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.380> very<00:04:24.620> thick<00:04:25.100> heavy-duty

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
on and watch a spin now this actually

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.590 
on and watch a spin now this actually
comes<00:04:42.860> with<00:04:43.190> this<00:04:43.610> little<00:04:43.670> stainless<00:04:44.210> steel

comes with this little stainless steel
counter<00:04:44.870> balance<00:04:45.410> sometimes<00:04:46.190> if<00:04:46.430> you've<00:04:46.580> ever

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
counter balance sometimes if you've ever

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.270 
counter balance sometimes if you've ever
used<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:47.270> rotisserie<00:04:47.960> before<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:49.040> has<00:04:49.250> a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
used a rotisserie before it has a

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.390 
used a rotisserie before it has a
tendency<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.450> not<00:04:50.690> spend<00:04:51.190> evenly<00:04:52.190> and

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
tendency to to not spend evenly and

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.040 
tendency to to not spend evenly and
that's<00:04:52.730> just<00:04:52.940> because<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:53.510> might<00:04:53.720> not<00:04:53.900> have

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that's just because you might not have

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.590 
that's just because you might not have
stuck<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.530> food<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:55.700> know<00:04:55.820> perfectly<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
stuck the food you know perfectly the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.480 
stuck the food you know perfectly the
dead<00:04:56.810> center<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.830> don't<00:04:57.950> have<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.220> good

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
dead center and you don't have a good

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.510 
dead center and you don't have a good
even<00:04:59.150> spinning<00:04:59.660> motion<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.310> a

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
even spinning motion so this is a

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.930 
even spinning motion so this is a
counterbalance<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.840> allows<00:05:03.170> you<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.940> pull

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
counterbalance that allows you to pull

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.350 
counterbalance that allows you to pull
this<00:05:05.150> out<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.750> just<00:05:06.290> kind<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.190> offset<00:05:07.790> any

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
this out and just kind of offset any

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.540 
this out and just kind of offset any
deficiencies<00:05:09.200> and<00:05:09.440> how<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.860> stop<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.340> meat

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
deficiencies and how you stop the meat

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.760 
deficiencies and how you stop the meat
there<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.210> allow<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:11.690> spin<00:05:12.020> evenly<00:05:12.560> and

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
there and allow it to spin evenly and

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.460 
there and allow it to spin evenly and
cook<00:05:13.550> evenly<00:05:13.910> throughout<00:05:14.480> the<00:05:14.540> process

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.170
