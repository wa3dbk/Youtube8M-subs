00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.350
 sheep are opponent 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.859

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.659
 seated but the skin of the kickboxing world is stepping out and watching 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.580
 life more serious and 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580

 fair at the soundtrack 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.950
 I thought that was human 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.300
 not the army 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.590
 after sitting out a bit 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 it ever 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.790
 year not in 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.860
 political unrest everywhere 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.240
 i live doing all those things 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 and all those negative messages and that is 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.340

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.349
 then went both times 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.929
 to have 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.559

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.989
 in bed that day 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.069

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.810
 see before the Muslim brothers I think that the prophet peace be upon him 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.679

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.209
