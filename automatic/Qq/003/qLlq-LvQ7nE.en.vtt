batteries<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.140> do<00:00:44.289> need<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.559> be<00:00:44.649> pretty

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
batteries you do need to be pretty

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.069 
batteries you do need to be pretty
careful<00:00:45.039> with<00:00:45.550> them<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:46.210> one<00:00:46.480> he<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.690> at<00:00:46.960> the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
careful with them this one he is at the

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.560 
careful with them this one he is at the
end<00:00:47.199> of<00:00:47.289> his<00:00:47.440> life<00:00:47.710> has<00:00:48.070> only<00:00:48.250> got<00:00:48.570> 738

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
end of his life has only got 738

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
end of his life has only got 738
milliamp<00:00:50.199> hours<00:00:50.590> so<00:00:50.859> I'm<00:00:51.670> gonna<00:00:51.820> sacrifice<00:00:52.120> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.959 

so<00:00:56.170> I've<00:00:56.320> cut<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.920> plastic<00:00:57.129> off<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.550> top<00:00:57.730> here

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
so I've cut the plastic off the top here

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.919 
so I've cut the plastic off the top here
anyway<00:00:58.329> and<00:01:00.059> determine<00:01:01.059> was<00:01:01.239> on<00:01:01.359> these<00:01:01.510> are

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
anyway and determine was on these are

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.639 
anyway and determine was on these are
very<00:01:01.960> close<00:01:02.469> together<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.690> rim<00:01:04.899> of<00:01:04.929> this<00:01:05.259> is

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
very close together the rim of this is

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.469 
very close together the rim of this is
negative<00:01:06.399> I<00:01:06.670> mean<00:01:06.970> you've<00:01:07.090> got<00:01:07.179> the<00:01:07.270> positive

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
negative I mean you've got the positive

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.960 
negative I mean you've got the positive
probably<00:01:08.229> about<00:01:08.380> five<00:01:08.740> millimeters<00:01:09.310> away<00:01:09.429> in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
probably about five millimeters away in

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.499 
probably about five millimeters away in
the<00:01:10.600> center<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.070> very<00:01:12.220> easy<00:01:12.550> if<00:01:13.390> you

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
the center here so it's very easy if you

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.570 
the center here so it's very easy if you
connect<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.960> wire<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.470> here<00:01:14.709> you've<00:01:15.190> got<00:01:15.280> small

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
connect a wire on here you've got small

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.160 
connect a wire on here you've got small
Nick<00:01:15.849> in<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.090> plastic<00:01:16.690> which<00:01:16.869> would<00:01:17.080> have

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
Nick in the plastic which would have

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.870 
Nick in the plastic which would have
been<00:01:17.289> on<00:01:17.500> here<00:01:17.740> we<00:01:18.610> should<00:01:18.759> I've<00:01:18.819> take<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.240> off

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
been on here we should I've take it off

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.730 
been on here we should I've take it off
snow<00:01:21.880> Nick<00:01:22.209> and<00:01:22.539> your<00:01:22.750> short<00:01:23.440> layout

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
snow Nick and your short layout

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
snow Nick and your short layout
straightaway<00:01:24.569> just<00:01:25.569> to<00:01:25.690> prove<00:01:26.259> it<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.920> rim

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
straightaway just to prove it the rim

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.630 
straightaway just to prove it the rim
got<00:01:29.530> positive<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.280> center<00:01:31.649> then<00:01:32.649> very

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
got positive in the center then very

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.199 
got positive in the center then very
edge<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.720> negative<00:01:35.580> now<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.940> can<00:01:37.060> see

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
edge of it is a negative now you can see

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.609 
edge of it is a negative now you can see
on<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.420> multimeter<00:01:37.810> we've<00:01:38.020> got<00:01:38.110> four<00:01:38.349> point

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
on the multimeter we've got four point

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.510 
on the multimeter we've got four point
seven<00:01:38.860> volts<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.170> yeah<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> whole<00:01:41.709> outside<00:01:41.950> is

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
seven volts so yeah the whole outside is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.059 
seven volts so yeah the whole outside is
negative<00:01:43.030> it's<00:01:43.750> just<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.050> small<00:01:44.410> part<00:01:44.709> in<00:01:44.860> here

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
negative it's just a small part in here

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.410 
negative it's just a small part in here
which<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.459> a<00:01:45.489> positive<00:01:45.970> terminal<00:01:48.420> decent

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
which is a positive terminal decent

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.270 
which is a positive terminal decent
quality<00:01:49.599> sales<00:01:50.020> generally<00:01:50.770> won't<00:01:50.950> blow<00:01:51.250> up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
quality sales generally won't blow up

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.839 
quality sales generally won't blow up
but<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.500> best<00:01:53.679> not<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.920> shore<00:01:54.190> now<00:01:54.520> anyway

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
but it's best not to shore now anyway

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.830 
but it's best not to shore now anyway
just<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.239> case<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:58.030> I've<00:01:58.239> never<00:01:58.450> shorted

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
just in case I don't I've never shorted

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.540 
just in case I don't I've never shorted
well<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.110> self<00:01:59.560> never<00:01:59.739> short<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.190> know<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.310> have

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
well I self never short you know I have

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.800 
well I self never short you know I have
accidentally<00:02:01.209> short<00:02:01.479> them<00:02:01.720> out<00:02:03.539> but<00:02:04.539> we<00:02:04.629> won't

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
accidentally short them out but we won't

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.639 
accidentally short them out but we won't
go<00:02:04.959> into<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:06.149> anyway<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:07.470> we're<00:02:08.470> gonna

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
go into that anyway so we're gonna

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.460 
go into that anyway so we're gonna
connect<00:02:09.069> them<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.610> these<00:02:10.599> batteries<00:02:11.080> here<00:02:11.290> in

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
connect them in these batteries here in

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.360 
connect them in these batteries here in
series<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
series and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.699 
series and
she's<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> use<00:02:16.599> these<00:02:16.810> are<00:02:17.110> crocodile

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
she's going to use these are crocodile

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.449 
she's going to use these are crocodile
clips<00:02:18.069> here<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.200> obviously<00:02:21.040> there's<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
clips here and we obviously there's a

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.240 
clips here and we obviously there's a
positive<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> negative<00:02:22.480> terminal<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:24.069> way

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
positive and a negative terminal the way

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.449 
positive and a negative terminal the way
we<00:02:24.400> find<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.879> out<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.330> with<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> multimedia

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
we find that out is with the multimedia

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.530 
we find that out is with the multimedia
as<00:02:27.459> always<00:02:27.670> you've<00:02:27.760> got<00:02:27.879> your<00:02:28.030> cables

connected up the right way the red to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.600 
connected up the right way the red to
positive<00:02:30.940> or<00:02:31.420> black<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.810> negative<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:33.430> we

positive or black to negative if we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.880 
positive or black to negative if we
connect<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.299> wrong<00:02:34.480> way<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.500> put<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
connect up the wrong way and put the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.750 
connect up the wrong way and put the
negative<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.700> positive<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.220> positive<00:02:39.370> or

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
negative to positive and the positive or

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.080 
negative to positive and the positive or
negative<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.629> small<00:02:40.980> icon<00:02:41.980> come<00:02:42.549> up<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
negative we get a small icon come up and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.930 
negative we get a small icon come up and
negative<00:02:43.510> icon<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:45.069> shows<00:02:45.340> us<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.640> you've

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
negative icon it shows us that you've

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.280 
negative icon it shows us that you've
got<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.530> are<00:02:47.709> cables<00:02:48.010> around<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.610> wrong<00:02:48.790> way

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
got the are cables around the wrong way

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.780 
got the are cables around the wrong way
so<00:02:50.290> if<00:02:50.769> we<00:02:50.950> switch<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.519> round<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:54.489> that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
so if we switch it back round then that

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.039 
so if we switch it back round then that
icon<00:02:55.209> will<00:02:55.390> disappear<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.489> can<00:02:57.790> see<00:02:58.049> and

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
icon will disappear as you can see and

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.720 
icon will disappear as you can see and
that<00:02:59.230> means<00:02:59.440> then<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.739> know<00:03:00.040> which<00:03:00.280> side<00:03:00.579> is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that means then we know which side is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.250 
that means then we know which side is
positive<00:03:01.209> which<00:03:01.450> side<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.870> negative<00:03:03.599> okay<00:03:05.790> so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
positive which side is negative okay so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.690 
positive which side is negative okay so
we've<00:03:08.260> established<00:03:08.290> which<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.190> positive

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
we've established which is positive

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.130 
we've established which is positive
which<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:09.940> negative<00:03:10.540> now<00:03:10.840> we're<00:03:10.989> going<00:03:11.079> to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
which is negative now we're going to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.330 
which is negative now we're going to
connect<00:03:11.470> them<00:03:11.560> up<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.610> I'm<00:03:12.730> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> go

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.729 

positive<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:20.829> negative<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.840> then<00:03:22.959> sign<00:03:23.380> again

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
positive to negative and then sign again

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.250 
positive to negative and then sign again
here<00:03:26.310> positive<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.940> negative<00:03:27.970> now<00:03:28.870> obviously

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
here positive to negative now obviously

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.440 
here positive to negative now obviously
we're<00:03:29.560> doing<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> increase<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.940> voltage

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we're doing this to increase the voltage

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.670 
we're doing this to increase the voltage
output<00:03:32.340> rather<00:03:33.340> than<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:34.440> increase<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
output rather than to increase the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.080 
output rather than to increase the
amount<00:03:35.889> of<00:03:36.010> power<00:03:36.940> storage<00:03:37.510> we<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:39.090> now

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
amount of power storage we have so now

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.849 
amount of power storage we have so now
if<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.389> put<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.049> negative<00:03:41.440> terminal

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
if I put this on the negative terminal

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.780 
if I put this on the negative terminal
of<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:41.950> first<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.720> 4<00:03:47.019> volts<00:03:47.470> here

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
of the first one we have 4 volts here

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.069 
of the first one we have 4 volts here
and<00:03:48.790> then<00:03:48.880> we<00:03:48.940> go<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.269> next<00:03:49.510> batch<00:03:49.780> we've

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
and then we go to the next batch we've

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.979 
and then we go to the next batch we've
increased<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.739> voltage<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.660> we've<00:03:52.810> got<00:03:52.959> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
increased the voltage and we've got a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.440 
increased the voltage and we've got a
7.2<00:03:53.769> these<00:03:54.190> batteries<00:03:54.609> aren't<00:03:54.880> charged<00:03:55.150> so

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
7.2 these batteries aren't charged so

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.879 
7.2 these batteries aren't charged so
I'm<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.630> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.840> get<00:03:55.959> 12<00:03:56.319> volts<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:57.120> think

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
I'm not going to get 12 volts I think

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.289 
I'm not going to get 12 volts I think
with<00:03:59.889> 10<00:04:00.160> volts<00:04:00.549> but<00:04:00.669> these<00:04:00.880> were<00:04:01.030> fully

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
with 10 volts but these were fully

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.800 
with 10 volts but these were fully
charged<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.959> be<00:04:02.380> around<00:04:02.680> 12<00:04:03.040> point<00:04:03.340> 6<00:04:03.639> volts

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
charged to be around 12 point 6 volts

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.309 
charged to be around 12 point 6 volts
but<00:04:04.810> then<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.260> obviously<00:04:06.069> we've<00:04:06.250> got<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.519> up

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
but then so obviously we've got this up

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.530 
but then so obviously we've got this up
wide<00:04:08.319> up<00:04:08.650> there<00:04:08.889> in<00:04:09.130> series<00:04:09.700> obviously<00:04:10.269> don't

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
wide up there in series obviously don't

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.300 
wide up there in series obviously don't
connect<00:04:10.959> these<00:04:11.109> two<00:04:11.349> terminals<00:04:11.680> together

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
connect these two terminals together

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
connect these two terminals together
because<00:04:12.880> if<00:04:13.030> not<00:04:13.209> you'll<00:04:13.389> create<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.750> short<00:04:14.109> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
because if not you'll create a short and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.159 
because if not you'll create a short and
then<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.709> will<00:04:14.940> melt<00:04:15.940> your<00:04:16.090> wires<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.959> you'll

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
then you will melt your wires and you'll

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.160 
then you will melt your wires and you'll
hit<00:04:17.260> some<00:04:17.320> sparks<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:19.320> possibly<00:04:20.320> some<00:04:20.590> snow

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
hit some sparks and possibly some snow

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.400 
hit some sparks and possibly some snow
possibly<00:04:23.170> an<00:04:23.380> explosion<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:26.080> long<00:04:26.230> as<00:04:26.320> you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
possibly an explosion but as long as you

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.840 
possibly an explosion but as long as you
don't<00:04:26.530> connect<00:04:26.890> these<00:04:27.040> two<00:04:27.280> together<00:04:27.430> you

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
don't connect these two together you

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.030 
don't connect these two together you
should<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.210> okay<00:04:28.630> now<00:04:29.140> I've<00:04:29.530> got<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.770> little

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
should be okay now I've got this little

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.020 
should be okay now I've got this little
LED<00:04:30.730> light<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.240> strip<00:04:31.540> here<00:04:32.400> 12<00:04:33.400> volts<00:04:33.790> so

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
LED light and strip here 12 volts so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.900 
LED light and strip here 12 volts so
I've<00:04:35.020> got<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.350> arm<00:04:35.530> positive<00:04:36.460> connection

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
I've got the arm positive connection

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:52.500 
I've got the arm positive connection
here<00:04:47.400> no<00:04:48.400> sparks<00:04:49.180> no<00:04:49.540> smoke<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:51.120> no<00:04:52.120> melted

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
here no sparks no smoke and no melted

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.100 
here no sparks no smoke and no melted
wires<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.170> must<00:04:53.380> be<00:04:53.440> doing<00:04:53.530> something<00:04:53.740> right

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
wires so I must be doing something right

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.260 
wires so I must be doing something right
it<00:04:57.010> does<00:04:57.160> sound<00:04:57.430> complicated<00:04:58.260> on<00:04:59.260> paper<00:05:00.270> but

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
it does sound complicated on paper but

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.210 
it does sound complicated on paper but
once<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.570> get<00:05:01.660> your<00:05:01.840> head<00:05:01.990> around<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.560> it's

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
once you get your head around it it's

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.340 
once you get your head around it it's
pretty<00:05:03.430> simple<00:05:03.520> really

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
pretty simple really

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.610 
pretty simple really
and<00:05:05.350> anyway<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.710> hope<00:05:05.890> this<00:05:06.070> helps<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.620> yeah

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
and anyway I hope this helps and yeah
