00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello that such friends welcome to zone 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.549
 ghost I'm a fan we go with another challenge 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.139
 of gta 5 so good what are we going to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.030
 to do now is that we're going to get on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.920
 a helicopter we are here where is the 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 hospital I will show you where it is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.279
 this so that you can come and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.039
 grab a helicopter completely 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 free and without any effort then 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 is here in this part of the map is 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.410
 you come and what we are going to do is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.630
 that we're going to grab one of the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 helicopters that are here sometimes are 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 and sometimes not then like that if you do not 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 appear you have to wait for the next 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 day to return and then grab one of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 these helicopters sometimes there is one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 Sometimes there are two but good today we had the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 lucky that there are two so we're going to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.489
 choose one of these and we 're going to go and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 let's go flying quite far to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 where there is a pool, a pool or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 as you want to call 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.079
 and we 're going to stretch from the top 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 that we can arrive with the helicopter and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.630
 try to fall in the water without dying 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.510
 so I think this is going to be 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.730
 so little, so I hope it's the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 have a great time and remember to leave your like 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.000
 so that there is more for it to rise more 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 continued 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.980
 to five challenges so let's go with this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.020
 challenge and without looking many likes then 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.900
 we will continue to rise from those challenges 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.550
 more followed and also let me down the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.820
 comments that challenge want me to do 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.770
 for the next one so it's also going to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 have a playlist where 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 are all the previous challenges already 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.780
 done so that in case you tell me 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.150
 I already did it because that's where we 're going 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.610
 to find a pool here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.040
 I do not find I need prison like this 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.220
 like it's big enough to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.300
 to be able to fine-tune to like him so well 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.980
 at the mere center and well the thing some 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.430
 I was told to jump off a helicopter 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.010
 water and what and that you fall and that does not happen to you 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.010
 nothing, so you survive but 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 but this one I think it would be easy to throw myself 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.760
 here the water where there is enough place and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 others told me to throw a pool for you 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.890
 do it more emotion then I think 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.500
 let's go to a pool and we 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.860
 let's take an ax carrying a super 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.930
 nailed from the helicopter I hope that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.540
 everything goes well and we can meet 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.860
 that challenge to be able to continue with the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.599
 next that you are going to leave there 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.620
 down in the comments so now 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.019
 you know 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.920
 can find loose but so easy and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.360
 Where there quickly grabbed this and other 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.120
 claw way helicopter saying the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 once in military but this is a little 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.849
 complicated then it's not difficult I say 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.190
 It is not impossible but if you can 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.040
 so if you want a quick easy one 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.440
 can you grab this one then we're going to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.970
 going here has to have something 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.710
 interesting some pool where we 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.790
 we can pull 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.459
 and we can swim 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.400
 how rich when you do not get into the pool 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.629
 and you're swimming there ever been 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.240
 tucked in while swimming completely with nothing 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.590
 of clothes with a girl 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.300
 I would, but it would be interesting for the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.360
 that have not done it 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.090
 they imagine with their girl especially 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.070
 that is mostly done at night because 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 Well, if there are not people like that at dawn 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.050
 and we found a pool ok then 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.870
 let's try to take it to the highest 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.310
 that we can this helicopter go for 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.870
 up up for 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.650
 up that's it and we're going to stretch and 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.140
 we are in a very good position so a 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.440
 see how high you can get to this 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.020
 helicopter I hope it's super high 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.940
 we have parachutes I think 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.570
 I think I have to there from if 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.570
 no, it was worth it 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.280
 this year overcome until here comes if 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.220
 keeps going up I do not know if I'm going up 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.039
 for one side but but I think that there 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.070
 we are already close good guys good 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.860
 Boys and girls it was time to throw 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.500
 go there I go site by falls very well 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.449
 excellent where is the pool where 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.199
 where is the pool is moving 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:38.000
 the pool haha I will not fall to the 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.000
 right right right to gÃ¼ey 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.120
 could not believe that we were moved 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.910
 little bit the good aim failed us 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.740
 Chavos believes this good is a Facebook 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.430
 we all commit he is in life 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.110
 but in the games so let's do 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 another attempt I think that does not count 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.039
 I really do not fall into the pool so 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.229
