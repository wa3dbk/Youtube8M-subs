probably<00:04:02.100> done<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.520> show<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.760> year<00:04:03.090> ago<00:04:03.210> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
probably done the show a year ago and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.040 
probably done the show a year ago and
and<00:04:03.780> probably<00:04:04.170> gotten<00:04:04.500> an<00:04:05.280> audience<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.870> this

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
and probably gotten an audience but this

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.610 
and probably gotten an audience but this
wouldn't<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.580> generated<00:04:08.580> as<00:04:08.760> much<00:04:08.790> interest

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
wouldn't have generated as much interest

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.780 
wouldn't have generated as much interest
because<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.740> interest<00:04:10.980> just<00:04:11.250> frankly<00:04:11.610> wasn't

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
because the interest just frankly wasn't

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.270 
because the interest just frankly wasn't
there<00:04:12.210> before<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:13.170> my<00:04:13.440> Buddhist<00:04:13.800> monks<00:04:14.160> in

vow<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.770> silence<00:04:19.980> gone<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:21.000> think<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.140> very

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
vow of silence gone I think it's very

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.530 
vow of silence gone I think it's very
appropriate<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:23.040> gnome<00:04:23.850> decided<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.390> do

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
appropriate that gnome decided to do

appropriate that gnome decided to do
this<00:04:24.660> night<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:24.960> think<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.440> great<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950

this night I think it's great and
everything<00:04:26.540> however<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> friday<00:04:27.960> night
