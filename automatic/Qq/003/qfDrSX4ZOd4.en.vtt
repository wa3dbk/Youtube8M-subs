thread guide behind another thread guide

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.959 
thread guide behind another thread guide
just<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> needle<00:00:49.550> like<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
just at the top of the needle like that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.060 
just at the top of the needle like that
and<00:00:51.420> what's<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:51.840> important<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and what's very important is when we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
and what's very important is when we
thread<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.059> needle<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> sewing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thread up the needle on the sewing

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.369 
thread up the needle on the sewing
machine<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> thread<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.840> threaded

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
machine is that the thread is threaded

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
machine is that the thread is threaded
from<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> front<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.210> thread

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
from the front to the back the thread

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.470 
from the front to the back the thread
mustn't<00:01:00.840> twizzle<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> needle<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.129> all

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
mustn't twizzle around the needle at all

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
mustn't twizzle around the needle at all
so<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> presser<00:01:05.070> foot

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so I'm going to put the presser foot

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
so I'm going to put the presser foot
down<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> use<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> hand<00:01:06.510> wheel<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
down I'm going to use the hand wheel to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
down I'm going to use the hand wheel to
just<00:01:07.439> ensure<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> needles<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> highest

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
just ensure the needles at the highest

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
just ensure the needles at the highest
position<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> will<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
position because that will make it be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
position because that will make it be
easiest<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> thread<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> eye<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> needle

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
easiest to thread the eye of the needle

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020 
easiest to thread the eye of the needle
and<00:01:12.500> without<00:01:13.500> putting<00:01:14.040> my<00:01:14.280> foot<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> foot

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and without putting my foot on the foot

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.499 
and without putting my foot on the foot
pedal<00:01:15.420> making<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.000> needles<00:01:18.360> not

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
pedal making sure that the needles not

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
pedal making sure that the needles not
going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> move<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.229> putting<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.619> finger<00:01:19.979> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
going to move I'm putting my finger just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
going to move I'm putting my finger just
behind<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> eye<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> needle<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
behind the eye of the needle and then I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
behind the eye of the needle and then I
can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> whole<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> eye<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.570> the

can see the whole or the eye of the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.640 
can see the whole or the eye of the
needle<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.140> lot<00:01:25.350> better<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.790> order<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.650> thread

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> turn<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.329> hand<00:01:52.079> wheel<00:01:52.170> towards<00:01:52.829> me

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
going to turn the hand wheel towards me

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.850 
going to turn the hand wheel towards me
one<00:01:53.490> complete<00:01:54.000> revolution<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.470> take-up

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
one complete revolution so the take-up

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.410 
one complete revolution so the take-up
lever<00:01:55.920> goes<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.909> needle<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
lever goes down the needle goes down and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.440 
lever goes down the needle goes down and
the<00:02:00.420> top<00:02:00.840> thread<00:02:01.500> swings<00:02:02.070> across<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.149> top<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the top thread swings across the top of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
the top thread swings across the top of
the<00:02:03.600> bobbin<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> hook<00:02:04.409> race<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.520> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the bobbin in the hook race because it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
the bobbin in the hook race because it's
making<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.390> stitch<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
making one stitch can you see that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.300 
making one stitch can you see that
happening

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
happening

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.660 
happening
and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.440> take-up<00:02:10.890> lever<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and then as the take-up lever and the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.150 
and then as the take-up lever and the
needle<00:02:12.060> bit<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> highest<00:02:12.780> position<00:02:13.560> we

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
needle bit to the highest position we

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.180 
needle bit to the highest position we
can<00:02:14.370> pull<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.870> top<00:02:16.110> thread<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.040> bobbin

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can pull with the top thread the bobbin

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.870 
can pull with the top thread the bobbin
thread<00:02:17.700> comes<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.840> through<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.980> needle<00:02:20.640> plate

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
thread comes up through the needle plate

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.990 
thread comes up through the needle plate
we<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.870> pull<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> loop<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.370> bobbin<00:02:23.730> thread

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
we can pull the loop of bobbin thread

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.740 
we can pull the loop of bobbin thread
put<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.170> way<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.750> then

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
put it all the way out like that then

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.290 
put it all the way out like that then
again<00:02:28.739> put<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> top<00:02:29.760> thread<00:02:30.000> through<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
again put the top thread through the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.030 
again put the top thread through the
presser<00:02:30.870> foot<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.319> help<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> the

presser foot to help the back of the
machine<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.330> bobbin<00:02:33.690> thread<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.590> then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
machine with the bobbin thread and then

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.380 
machine with the bobbin thread and then
take<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.519> cover<00:02:35.790> plate<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.620> carefully<00:02:38.390> snap
