00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
for the effect and I only noticed once I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.530 
for the effect and I only noticed once I
watched<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.670> behind-the-scenes<00:04:03.300> footage

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
watched the behind-the-scenes footage

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.050 
watched the behind-the-scenes footage
that<00:04:03.959> my<00:04:04.110> tripod<00:04:04.620> isn't<00:04:05.190> keeping<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.730> slider

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
that my tripod isn't keeping the slider

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
that my tripod isn't keeping the slider
level<00:04:06.600> throughout<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.050> movement<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
level throughout the movement so if I

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.430 
level throughout the movement so if I
had<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.550> longer<00:04:08.850> slider<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.600> would<00:04:09.900> definitely

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
had a longer slider I would definitely

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.470 
had a longer slider I would definitely
need<00:04:10.590> support<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.400> both<00:04:11.640> ends

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
need support on both ends

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.660 
need support on both ends
because<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.319> used<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.650> quick-release<00:04:13.860> plate

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
because I used a quick-release plate

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.879 
because I used a quick-release plate
occasionally<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.510> low-riding<00:04:16.200> carriage

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
occasionally the low-riding carriage

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.460 
occasionally the low-riding carriage
would<00:04:17.340> run<00:04:17.669> into<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> rubber<00:04:18.269> grip<00:04:18.630> causing<00:04:19.230> a

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
would run into the rubber grip causing a

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.560 
would run into the rubber grip causing a
ruined<00:04:19.889> shot<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.090> would<00:04:21.480> definitely

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
ruined shot so I would definitely

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.350 
ruined shot so I would definitely
benefit<00:04:22.139> from<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.410> modified<00:04:22.919> set-up<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.639> more

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
benefit from a modified set-up and more

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.680 
benefit from a modified set-up and more
practice<00:04:25.370> because<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.520> slider<00:04:26.850> lets<00:04:27.180> me<00:04:27.360> set

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
practice because the slider lets me set

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.719 
practice because the slider lets me set
the<00:04:27.840> camera<00:04:28.290> on<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.500> radius<00:04:29.070> away<00:04:29.340> from<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
the camera on a radius away from the

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.870 
the camera on a radius away from the
tripod<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.570> set<00:04:31.200> up<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.410> unique<00:04:31.800> Snorri<00:04:32.250> cam<00:04:32.580> shot

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
tripod I set up a unique Snorri cam shot

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.510 
tripod I set up a unique Snorri cam shot
following<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.840> baseball<00:04:34.350> bat<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:35.220> smooth

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
following a baseball bat the smooth

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550 
following a baseball bat the smooth
motion<00:04:35.790> allowed<00:04:36.300> me<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.510> speed<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.139> up<00:04:37.290> without

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
motion allowed me to speed it up without

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.060 
motion allowed me to speed it up without
adding<00:04:38.100> any<00:04:38.220> shake<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.020> Indy<00:04:40.380> slider<00:04:40.740> mini

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
adding any shake so the Indy slider mini

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.790 
adding any shake so the Indy slider mini
definitely<00:04:41.820> added<00:04:42.180> some<00:04:42.389> cinematic<00:04:42.990> style<00:04:43.560> to

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
definitely added some cinematic style to

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.520 
definitely added some cinematic style to
my<00:04:43.919> project<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:45.150> on<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.419> shoot<00:04:45.840> with<00:04:46.050> lots<00:04:46.380> of

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
my project but on a shoot with lots of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.379 
my project but on a shoot with lots of
actors<00:04:46.950> lots<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.639> variables

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
actors lots of variables

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.600 
actors lots of variables
I<00:04:48.510> would<00:04:48.930> love<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.169> slider<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:50.070> performs

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
I would love a slider that just performs

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.300 
I would love a slider that just performs
flawlessly<00:04:51.419> on<00:04:51.570> every<00:04:52.080> tank<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.650> that's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
flawlessly on every tank and that's

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.210 
flawlessly on every tank and that's
expensive<00:04:53.790> so<00:04:54.690> while<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.080> may<00:04:55.380> not<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:55.830> ready<00:04:56.040> to

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
expensive so while I may not be ready to

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.250 
expensive so while I may not be ready to
add<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> slider<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.240> my<00:04:57.360> arsenal<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:58.020> friend

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
add a slider to my arsenal my friend
