huckleberry and I promise this will be a
quick<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.650> think<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.220> less<00:00:05.400> than<00:00:05.609> four

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
quick video I think it's less than four

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.030 
quick video I think it's less than four
minutes<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:07.020> got<00:00:07.200> into<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.740> gameplay

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
minutes and I got into this gameplay

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.430 
minutes and I got into this gameplay
halfway<00:00:08.670> through<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.080> were<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
halfway through and we were down a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.209 
halfway through and we were down a
little<00:00:10.800> over<00:00:11.040> ten<00:00:11.250> points<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.420> Kill<00:00:12.719> Confirmed

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
little over ten points in Kill Confirmed

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.650 
little over ten points in Kill Confirmed
and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.309> didn't<00:00:14.549> know<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.450> would

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and I didn't know you know what we would

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.260 
and I didn't know you know what we would
if<00:00:15.990> he'd<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.260> able<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> win<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.310> hung<00:00:17.880> back<00:00:17.910> in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
if he'd be able to win it I hung back in

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.760 
if he'd be able to win it I hung back in
the<00:00:18.359> spawn<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.930> at<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> beginning<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the spawn just at the beginning got a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
the spawn just at the beginning got a
couple<00:00:20.010> kills<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.640> then<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.820> died<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.510> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
couple kills and then I died so this is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
couple kills and then I died so this is
after<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:23.880> kind<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.449> charging

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
after that and now I'm kind of charging

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
after that and now I'm kind of charging
forward<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.350> recommend<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:26.820> into

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
forward I recommend it when you get into

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
forward I recommend it when you get into
a<00:00:27.000> game<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.420> mid<00:00:27.779> game<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> assess

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a game like this mid game kind of assess

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
a game like this mid game kind of assess
where<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.429> enemy<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.760> they're<00:00:30.300> probably

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
where the enemy is they're probably

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
where the enemy is they're probably
small<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.109> trapping<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.669> into<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
small and trapping you if you get into a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
small and trapping you if you get into a
game<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.079> means<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> somebody

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
game because what that means is somebody

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
game because what that means is somebody
likely<00:00:35.309> dropped<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.120> you're<00:00:36.480> taking

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
likely dropped out and you're taking

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.350 
likely dropped out and you're taking
their<00:00:36.899> place<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:38.010> rock<00:00:38.250> frustrated<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
their place and they rock frustrated so

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330 
their place and they rock frustrated so
the<00:00:39.480> enemy<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> doing<00:00:40.050> something<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the enemy is doing something up to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
the enemy is doing something up to
frustrate<00:00:41.790> people<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> hung<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
frustrate people so kind of hung back a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
frustrate people so kind of hung back a
little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.850> comfortable

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
little bit got a little more comfortable

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.990 
little bit got a little more comfortable
where<00:00:45.690> people<00:00:45.989> were<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> then

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
where people were going and and then

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600 
where people were going and and then
went<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.950> this<00:00:49.950> game<00:00:50.160> plays<00:00:50.399> with

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
went from there so this game plays with

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
went from there so this game plays with
the<00:00:50.700> scar<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.270> raid<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.620> 30<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.579> it's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the scar on raid I go 30 and three it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
the scar on raid I go 30 and three it's
only<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.020> half<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> game<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.160> 30<00:00:56.460> kills

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
only you know half the game so 30 kills

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490 
only you know half the game so 30 kills
and<00:00:56.969> half<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> game<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.170> good<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and half the game was pretty good I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
and half the game was pretty good I
thought<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.160> low<00:01:00.030> less<00:01:00.449> deaths<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:01.050> usual

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thought and low less deaths than usual

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
thought and low less deaths than usual
because<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> shorter<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.120> frame<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because of the shorter time frame but I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.810 
because of the shorter time frame but I
wanted<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> talk<00:01:04.769> about<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.070> scar<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.640> how<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
wanted to talk about the scar and how I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
wanted to talk about the scar and how I
use<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.210> weapon<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
use this weapon I don't have all the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
use this weapon I don't have all the
attachments<00:01:08.070> yet<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.210> run<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
attachments yet I like to run the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.670 
attachments yet I like to run the
silencer<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.650> i<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.670> extended<00:01:12.240> clip

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
silencer on it i also like extended clip

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
silencer on it i also like extended clip
it<00:01:13.680> works<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> red<00:01:14.850> dot<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
it works really well with a red dot it
is<00:01:15.390> super<00:01:15.810> powerful<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.189> feel<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.400> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is super powerful and I feel like I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
is super powerful and I feel like I
really<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.030> put<00:01:18.150> people<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.420> quickly<00:01:18.869> with

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
really can put people down quickly with

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
really can put people down quickly with
the<00:01:19.229> red<00:01:19.380> dot<00:01:19.560> sight<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.759> running<00:01:21.030> ghost<00:01:21.299> in

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the red dot sight I'm running ghost in

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
the red dot sight I'm running ghost in
this<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.650> class<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> wonder

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this in this class and I kind of wonder

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
this in this class and I kind of wonder
why<00:01:23.880> why<00:01:24.780> did<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.799> you're

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
why why did that because when you're

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.700 
why why did that because when you're
firing<00:01:26.220> without<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.909> silencer<00:01:27.479> ghost<00:01:27.810> has<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
firing without a silencer ghost has a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
firing without a silencer ghost has a
little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.130> less<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> an<00:01:29.610> effect<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.840> I'm

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
little bit less of an effect and me I'm

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
little bit less of an effect and me I'm
you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.560> firing<00:01:31.890> every<00:01:32.340> five<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.610> ten

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you know I'm firing every five or ten

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.020 
you know I'm firing every five or ten
seconds<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.340> I'm<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> radar

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
seconds so I'm going to be on the radar

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
seconds so I'm going to be on the radar
with<00:01:36.270> anyway<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.250> shouldn't<00:01:38.430> have

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
with anyway the probably shouldn't have

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
with anyway the probably shouldn't have
run<00:01:38.670> ghost<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.930> pay<00:01:40.049> attention<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
run ghost but just pay attention to that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.999 
run ghost but just pay attention to that
and<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.790> found<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.710> once<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:43.950> started

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and I found that once we got started

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.100 
and I found that once we got started
here<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.079> my

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
here this is a if I could get to my

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
here this is a if I could get to my
score<00:01:46.500> streaks<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.979> realize<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
score streaks I realize now we have a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
score streaks I realize now we have a
chance<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.540> winning<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:49.079> down<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
chance of winning really down like you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.889 
chance of winning really down like you
know<00:01:50.070> eight<00:01:50.220> points<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> lead<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.689> lead

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
know eight points the lead is the lead

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
know eight points the lead is the lead
is<00:01:52.020> diminishing<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> tried<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.579> real

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is diminishing so I tried to be real

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
is diminishing so I tried to be real
careful<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.079> ran<00:01:55.350> away<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
careful here as you can see I ran away I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
careful here as you can see I ran away I
only<00:01:56.670> had<00:01:56.820> seven<00:01:57.000> bullets<00:01:57.240> left<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.689> no

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
only had seven bullets left in no

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
transition into the next kill if so I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.110 
transition into the next kill if so I
kind<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.160> fast<00:03:00.370> mags<00:03:00.610> for<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.910> may

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
kind of like fast mags for that I may

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.270 
kind of like fast mags for that I may
start<00:03:01.180> running<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.780> more<00:03:02.020> because<00:03:02.710> if<00:03:02.950> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
start running it more because if the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.370 
start running it more because if the
animation<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.850> pretty<00:03:04.030> cool<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:05.080> think<00:03:05.140> it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
animation is pretty cool and I think it

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.990 
animation is pretty cool and I think it
gives<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:05.740> little<00:03:05.980> bit<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.400> confidence

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
gives you a little bit of a confidence

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.110 
gives you a little bit of a confidence
boost<00:03:07.240> so<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.980> pick<00:03:09.400> up<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.610> couple<00:03:09.760> tags

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
boost so and I pick up a couple tags

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.450 
boost so and I pick up a couple tags
here<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.600> then<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.720> get<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.110> my<00:03:11.290> head<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.340> my

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
here and then I get to my head to my

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.940 
here and then I get to my head to my
score<00:03:12.700> streaks<00:03:13.980> now<00:03:14.980> I'm<00:03:15.940> not<00:03:16.180> really<00:03:16.950> you
