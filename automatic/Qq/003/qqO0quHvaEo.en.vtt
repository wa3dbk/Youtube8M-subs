00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.200 
that we're getting our fresh tomatoes in
like<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.950> said<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.280> I've<00:03:44.490> had<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> little<00:03:45.030> bit

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
like I said that I've had a little bit

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.730 
like I said that I've had a little bit
of<00:03:45.240> a<00:03:45.390> problem<00:03:45.660> because<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.320> birds<00:03:46.530> have<00:03:46.710> been

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
of a problem because the birds have been

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.280 
of a problem because the birds have been
eating<00:03:47.480> tomatoes<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:48.600> assuming<00:03:49.050> they're<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
eating tomatoes I'm assuming they're the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.200 
eating tomatoes I'm assuming they're the
birds<00:03:49.500> they<00:03:49.800> have<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.950> little<00:03:50.220> beak<00:03:50.880> mark

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
birds they have a little beak mark

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.020 
birds they have a little beak mark
something<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.780> much<00:03:51.990> maintenance<00:03:52.320> so

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
something all much maintenance so

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.690 
something all much maintenance so
hopefully<00:03:54.030> putting<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.600> netting<00:03:55.050> over<00:03:55.110> them

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
hopefully putting that netting over them

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
hopefully putting that netting over them
will<00:03:56.700> cure<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.590> seems<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.980> be

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
will cure it and that seems to be

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.240 
will cure it and that seems to be
working<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.430> far<00:03:59.760> because<00:04:00.800> here<00:04:01.800> are<00:04:01.980> some<00:04:02.130> to
