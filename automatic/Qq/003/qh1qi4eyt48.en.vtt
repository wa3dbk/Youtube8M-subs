00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579

here<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:01.640> actual<00:02:02.640> size

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
here you got them actual size

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.740 
here you got them actual size
and<00:02:05.260> yeah<00:02:06.190> actually<00:02:06.369> kind<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.729> hit<00:02:06.909> song<00:02:07.180> is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
and yeah actually kind of hit song is

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.180 
and yeah actually kind of hit song is
that's<00:02:08.850> but<00:02:09.850> i<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:11.590> i'm<00:02:11.830> pretty<00:02:12.010> sure

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
that's but i think i'm pretty sure

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.240 
that's but i think i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.750> set<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.319> out<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:15.040> better

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
that when this set can out or better

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.650 
that when this set can out or better
pack<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.860> pitch<00:02:18.850> driver<00:02:19.209> was

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
pack I think that the pitch driver was

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
pack I think that the pitch driver was
you<00:02:20.500> figure<00:02:21.010> as<00:02:21.450> well<00:02:22.450> as<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.989> imperial

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
you figure as well as the imperial

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.540 
you figure as well as the imperial
officer<00:02:24.910> I'm<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.780> sure<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.550> pray

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
officer I'm not sure but I don't pray

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.630

doctor<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:28.480> they're<00:02:28.780> not<00:02:28.959> new<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.640> um

now you get this satellite get those
piston<00:05:54.039> looks<00:05:54.250> set<00:05:54.930> get<00:05:55.930> flick<00:05:56.199> fire<00:05:56.440> missiles

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.950 
piston looks set get flick fire missiles
they're<00:05:57.220> kind<00:05:57.729> of<00:05:57.819> nice<00:05:57.970> i<00:05:58.120> guess<00:05:58.270> they<00:05:58.569> twirl

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
they're kind of nice i guess they twirl

they're kind of nice i guess they twirl
down<00:05:59.259> 65<00:05:59.800> degrees<00:06:00.190> let's<00:06:01.060> go<00:06:01.300> up<00:06:01.449> them<00:06:01.680> and

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
down 65 degrees let's go up them and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.029 
down 65 degrees let's go up them and
then<00:06:02.949> you<00:06:03.039> could<00:06:03.310> do<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.840> or<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:05.650> can<00:06:05.949> just

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
then you could do that or you can just

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.290 
then you could do that or you can just
keep<00:06:06.220> that<00:06:07.050> either<00:06:08.050> way<00:06:08.849> but<00:06:09.849> they're<00:06:10.060> not<00:06:10.150> the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
keep that either way but they're not the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.200 
keep that either way but they're not the
best<00:06:11.039> nobody<00:06:12.039> likes<00:06:12.250> like<00:06:12.580> fire<00:06:12.759> missiles<00:06:13.090> do

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210
