these in the scansnap sb-600 very new
just<00:00:29.099> came<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> later<00:00:29.580> powder<00:00:29.849> last<00:00:30.119> year

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
just came out the later powder last year

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
just came out the later powder last year
it's<00:00:30.929> our<00:00:31.140> alternative<00:00:31.800> flatbed<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.820> an

scan<00:00:39.690> content<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.590> ahead<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.770> scan

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
scan content so I just go ahead and scan

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
scan content so I just go ahead and scan
my<00:00:41.219> bound<00:00:41.430> material<00:00:41.850> very<00:00:42.180> easily<00:00:42.570> once<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
my bound material very easily once I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
my bound material very easily once I
completed<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.760> ahead<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> complete

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
completed that I go ahead and complete

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.180 
completed that I go ahead and complete
the<00:00:45.989> transaction<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> scanner

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the transaction right from the scanner

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
the transaction right from the scanner
and<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.110> raw<00:00:49.230> image<00:00:49.620> is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and you see up here all the raw image is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520 
and you see up here all the raw image is
being<00:00:50.129> displayed<00:00:51.000> guess<00:00:51.660> there's<00:00:52.410> some

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
being displayed guess there's some

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
being displayed guess there's some
curvature<00:00:53.280> inside<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.210> can

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
curvature inside of here I can

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
curvature inside of here I can
immediately<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.110> flatten<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
immediately just flatten that out just

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
immediately just flatten that out just
like<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.910> done<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> see

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
like that it's done if you want to see

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
like that it's done if you want to see
what's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> behind<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> scenes<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
what's going on behind the scenes it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
what's going on behind the scenes it's
automatically<00:01:00.059> resolving<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> center<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
automatically resolving the center and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
automatically resolving the center and
the<00:01:01.590> curb<00:01:01.829> area<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.000> ahead<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.270> then

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the curb area I can go ahead and then

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
the curb area I can go ahead and then
turn<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.100> typically

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
turn this into what would be typically

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
turn this into what would be typically
very<00:01:06.119> traditional<00:01:06.840> tile<00:01:07.049> scanning<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
very traditional tile scanning the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.350 
very traditional tile scanning the
result<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.670> wouldn't<00:01:09.000> even<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
result is you wouldn't even know this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
result is you wouldn't even know this
came<00:01:09.540> through<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> flatbed<00:01:10.250> alternative

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
came through a flatbed alternative

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.240 
came through a flatbed alternative
scanner<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.960> like<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.979> awesome

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
scanner just like that that's awesome

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
scanner just like that that's awesome
especially<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.000> fact<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.420> detects<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
especially the fact that it detects the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
especially the fact that it detects the
curvature<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> fixes<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> exactly

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
curvature and fixes it for you exactly

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.969 
curvature and fixes it for you exactly
makes<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> very<00:01:19.110> simple<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.830> really

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
makes it very simple and that's really

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
makes it very simple and that's really
the<00:01:20.100> concept<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> scans<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> overall<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.990> one

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the concept of scans have overall so one

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.450 
the concept of scans have overall so one
of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> other<00:01:22.409> cool<00:01:22.560> things<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.280> do

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
of the other cool things we can do is do

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.039 
of the other cool things we can do is do
like<00:01:23.670> three-dimensional<00:01:24.000> objects<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
like three-dimensional objects and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
like three-dimensional objects and
you'll<00:01:25.259> notice<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.979> scan<00:01:26.280> these

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you'll notice that if when I scan these

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
you'll notice that if when I scan these
objects<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.750> head<00:01:27.960> assembly<00:01:28.380> moves<00:01:28.650> so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
objects here this head assembly moves so

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
objects here this head assembly moves so
that<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> reflection<00:01:29.909> does<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.600> up

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that the reflection does not go back up

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
that the reflection does not go back up
into<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> optics<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:32.100> kind

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
into the optics so I don't get any kind

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
into the optics so I don't get any kind
of<00:01:32.369> artifacting<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.150> anything<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
of artifacting or anything like that I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
of artifacting or anything like that I
can<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> 10<00:01:34.890> objects<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
can put up to 10 objects in here and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
can put up to 10 objects in here and
they're<00:01:36.090> automatically<00:01:36.630> cropped<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> ready

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they're automatically cropped and ready

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.030 
they're automatically cropped and ready
to<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:39.030> simple<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> scan<00:01:40.320> objects

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to go so very simple way to scan objects

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
to go so very simple way to scan objects
and<00:01:41.189> content<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> typically<00:01:42.299> put<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and content that you typically put in a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.389 
and content that you typically put in a
flat<00:01:42.840> bed<00:01:43.049> without<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.950> cumbersome

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
flat bed without all of that cumbersome

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.899 
flat bed without all of that cumbersome
effort<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> great<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> save<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.549> whole

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
effort it's a great way to save a whole

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
effort it's a great way to save a whole
