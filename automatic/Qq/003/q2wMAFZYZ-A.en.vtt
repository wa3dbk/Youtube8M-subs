00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.710
 of air wanted to start a little 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.539
 joking but it is true that here the stand 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 tempted and there are phones 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 interesting for all the great nemo a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.210
 5.7-inch display a system of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 interesting unlock with the possibility 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.289
 to have 6 icons to make quick links 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.309
 enter directly into the various

 feature a 1200 80 x 720 display 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 pixel therefore 720p the qualcomm processor 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.589
 gsm umts and 3200 milian battery for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 now 13 megapixel autofocus camera 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.129
 and flash LEDs 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 here the buttons for the volume above 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.269
 headphones shutdown sale while on 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.069
 left side insertion for the sim 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.920
 card and for the micro sd 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.370
 the touch keys are located outside the area 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 of the display which is therefore totally 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.450
 usable phone speed 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.970
 seems to be the first to this first 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.430
 good approach 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 integrated is a gigabyte as far as 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.410
 concerns system memory 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 let's also look at this button 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.470
 replicate the buttons below we support 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.070
 pressed, the multi home button appears 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.760
 window and menu is not all from the stand 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.950
 zte because very interesting too 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.950
 the great s lte 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.230
 very interesting because it's a phone 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:51.460
 with 5 inch full hd display then 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.260
 1920 x 1080 pixel display gorilla glass 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.570
 also this release system then 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.979
 if we make a quick slide we can 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.650
 go directly to the functions if 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.300
 we just want to unlock it we keep 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.950
 press and unlock the phone and lte 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.570
 we have the contact was for a possible 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.900
 docking station the door for the sim 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.209
 card right side the button for the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.910
 volume over headphone switch 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 turn off the front camera keys 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.709
 even here they are touch and out of the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.420
 screen under the micro usb and diets 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.600
 behind the room here also from 13 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.430
 megapixel with flash LED in my view the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.420
 So the version of Android software 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.140
 I say that the display seems to me a lot 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.030
 nice and the 4.1.2 even here is the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.260
 possibility to use the buttons 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.690
 let's say virtual backs as well as ad 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.430
 have them below a phone that has 2 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.430
 gigabytes of ram and 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.430
 integrated
