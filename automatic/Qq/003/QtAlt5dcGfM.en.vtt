00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
sort of a sidetrack I mean I think there
is<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.030> generation<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.780> very

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is I think this generation was very

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.649 
is I think this generation was very
important<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> sense<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.540> think<00:01:51.540> was

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
important in the sense that I think was

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
important in the sense that I think was
a<00:01:51.689> first<00:01:51.990> generation<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.710> people<00:01:53.670> who

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
a first generation that people who

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
a first generation that people who
weren't<00:01:54.000> gamers<00:01:54.420> could<00:01:54.630> look<00:01:54.750> at<00:01:54.869> games<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
weren't gamers could look at games and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
weren't gamers could look at games and
appreciate<00:01:55.829> them<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.070> their<00:01:56.310> visuals<00:01:57.079> we're

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
appreciate them for their visuals we're

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.450 
appreciate them for their visuals we're
like<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.590> parents<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.159> instance

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
like I think my parents for instance

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
like I think my parents for instance
when<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.790> know<00:02:00.149> I've<00:02:00.270> done<00:02:00.450> games<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
when they know I've done games for a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.080 
when they know I've done games for a
long<00:02:01.049> time<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:02.430> I'd<00:02:02.549> look<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> game

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
long time and like I'd look at a game

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.580 
long time and like I'd look at a game
like<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.479> did<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> game<00:02:03.840> many<00:02:04.020> years<00:02:04.170> ago<00:02:04.350> called

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
like we did a game many years ago called

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.789 
like we did a game many years ago called
system<00:02:04.860> shock<00:02:05.040> 2<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.469> could<00:02:07.469> look<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
system shock 2 and I could look at that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.350 
system shock 2 and I could look at that
game<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.789> period<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
game or a game of that period and I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.639 
game or a game of that period and I
appreciate<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> graphics<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.619> i

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
appreciate the graphics of it but i

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.010 
appreciate the graphics of it but i
think<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.700> graphics<00:02:12.060> were<00:02:12.180> too<00:02:12.390> abstract<00:02:12.840> for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
think the graphics were too abstract for

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
think the graphics were too abstract for
some<00:02:13.260> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
some of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
some of
parents<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.670> understand<00:02:15.420> even

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
parents look at it and understand even

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
parents look at it and understand even
what<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.800> screen<00:02:17.100> we're

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
what was going on on the screen we're

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.890 
what was going on on the screen we're
now<00:02:17.520> with<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:18.180> bioshock<00:02:18.420> i<00:02:18.630> think<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.840> was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
now with with bioshock i think it was

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.820 
now with with bioshock i think it was
the<00:02:18.990> first<00:02:19.080> game<00:02:19.260> they<00:02:19.350> looked<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.770> i

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
the first game they looked at that i

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.040 
the first game they looked at that i
made<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:21.120> graph<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.450> your<00:02:21.600> detailed

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
made that the graph is your detailed

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.420 
made that the graph is your detailed
enough<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.740> didn't<00:02:23.100> need<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> make

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
enough where they didn't need to make

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.590 
enough where they didn't need to make
that<00:02:23.580> sort<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> leap<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.120> faith<00:02:24.300> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that sort of leap of faith of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.130 
that sort of leap of faith of
understanding<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.690> take<00:02:27.990> these

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
understanding like to to to take these

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.960 
understanding like to to to take these
sort<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.350> relatively<00:02:28.950> abstract<00:02:29.250> images<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
sort of relatively abstract images and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.240 
sort of relatively abstract images and
turn<00:02:30.120> us<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.360> they<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.690> understand<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.220> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
turn us on they could understand so I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.199 
turn us on they could understand so I
think<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.760> know<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.150> first

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
think you know this is the first

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.610 
think you know this is the first
generation<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.930> did<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.500> will

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
generation that did that and that will

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.309 
generation that did that and that will
just<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:35.040> them<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.080> get<00:02:37.170> better

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
just get them that would just get better

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220 
just get them that would just get better
as<00:02:37.650> time<00:02:37.680> goes<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> look<00:02:39.569> more<00:02:39.870> memory

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
as time goes on and you look more memory

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.479 
as time goes on and you look more memory
better<00:02:40.470> graphics<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:40.950> always<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.280> know

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
better graphics are always of you know

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.120 
better graphics are always of you know
it's<00:02:41.670> always<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.940> good<00:02:42.090> thing<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:43.290> think

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
it's always a good thing to have I think

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's always a good thing to have I think
that<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.600> know<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:46.440> I'm<00:02:46.730> we'll<00:02:47.730> see

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that I'm you know that I'm we'll see

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.420 
that I'm you know that I'm we'll see
we'll<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> sort<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.840> time<00:02:49.769> will<00:02:50.040> sort<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
we'll have to sort of time will sort of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.400 
we'll have to sort of time will sort of
show<00:02:50.640> us<00:02:50.820> what<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> paradigm<00:02:51.570> shift<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.050> will

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
show us what the paradigm shift in will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
show us what the paradigm shift in will
bring<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.550> know<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:53.850> you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
bring like you know and you know if you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.060 
bring like you know and you know if you
look<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.570> ten<00:02:54.840> years<00:02:55.019> ago<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
look back you know ten years ago it

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.160 
look back you know ten years ago it
would<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.880> no<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.420> kind<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.630> things<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
would be no the kind of things like the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.640 
would be no the kind of things like the
connectivity<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.290> physics

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
connectivity and the and this or physics

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.110 
connectivity and the and this or physics
and<00:03:01.920> things<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.489> came<00:03:02.940> out<00:03:03.090> of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and things like that that came out of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.930 
and things like that that came out of
this<00:03:03.239> generation<00:03:03.980> were<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.220> always<00:03:05.430> clear

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
this generation were not always clear

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.130 
this generation were not always clear
from<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:06.239> beginning<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:06.959> don't

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
from the very beginning so I don't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.930 
from the very beginning so I don't
pretend<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> mean<00:03:08.130> our<00:03:08.250> profit<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.790> those

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
pretend to be a mean our profit of those

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.330 
pretend to be a mean our profit of those
things<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.650> mean<00:03:10.830> something<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.190> were

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
things and I mean something you were

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.559 
things and I mean something you were
talking<00:03:11.610> about<00:03:11.700> when<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.150> last<00:03:12.269> spoke<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
talking about when we last spoke a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.199 
talking about when we last spoke a
couple<00:03:12.660> years<00:03:12.959> ago<00:03:13.019> was<00:03:13.970> Sony<00:03:14.970> sort<00:03:15.150> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
couple years ago was Sony sort of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.030 
couple years ago was Sony sort of
courting<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.569> with<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.050> move<00:03:16.380> controls<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
courting you with the move controls and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.470 
courting you with the move controls and
they<00:03:17.400> came<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.150> want<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.329> make

they came that so that we want to make
you<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> believer<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:19.230> motion<00:03:19.620> motion<00:03:20.280> controls

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
you a believer in motion motion controls

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.360 
you a believer in motion motion controls
is<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:22.049> something<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.290> happened<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.829> is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
is that something that happened so is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.770 
is that something that happened so is
moving<00:03:23.820> an<00:03:23.910> integral<00:03:24.390> part<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
moving an integral part of the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.420 
moving an integral part of the
experience<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.380> how<00:03:25.440> significant<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.070> I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
experience and how significant is that I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.819 
experience and how significant is that I
think<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.600> know<00:03:27.720> what<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.500> pretty<00:03:28.739> much

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
think it's you know what I pretty much

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.190 
think it's you know what I pretty much
said<00:03:29.040> at<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.190> time<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.820> want<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.269> we<00:03:30.900> want<00:03:30.930> to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
said at the time is I want to we want to

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.960 
said at the time is I want to we want to
experiment<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:32.100> wanted<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> make<00:03:32.610> sure<00:03:32.640> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
experiment we wanted to make sure that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.330 
experiment we wanted to make sure that
that<00:03:33.000> experimentation<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:34.079> happening<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
that experimentation was happening in a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.130 
that experimentation was happening in a
way<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.670> protected<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> experience<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
way that protected the experience of the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.500 
way that protected the experience of the
of<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.739> non<00:03:37.950> mu<00:03:38.220> gamer<00:03:38.519> as<00:03:38.820> well<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.299> there's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
of the non mu gamer as well so there's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.229 
of the non mu gamer as well so there's
that<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.769> don't<00:03:40.860> moves<00:03:41.459> not<00:03:41.640> for<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.970> it

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
that if you don't moves not for you it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.819 
that if you don't moves not for you it
you<00:03:42.660> won't<00:03:42.810> even<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.680> won't

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
you won't even know it you you won't

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.750 
you won't even know it you you won't
know<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.100> there<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.459> that's<00:03:44.609> something

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
know it's there but if that's something

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.670 
know it's there but if that's something
you're<00:03:44.910> interested<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.530> especially<00:03:46.530> for

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
you're interested in especially for

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.080

people<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.220> said<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.790> don't

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
people like I said like you don't

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.880 
people like I said like you don't
normally<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:49.079> play<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> lot<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> games

kind of yeah I think it's quite barrier
if<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.880> haven't<00:03:54.180> used<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> big

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
if you haven't used I it's a big

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.660 
if you haven't used I it's a big
learning<00:03:55.320> curve<00:03:55.470> absolutely<00:03:56.280> that's<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.579> we

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
learning curve absolutely that's what we

learning curve absolutely that's what we
want<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.239> there's<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.989> there<00:03:58.769> are<00:03:58.829> people

see<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.770> sort<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.190> evolving<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.850> think<00:04:37.540> that

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
see that sort of evolving I think that

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.280 
see that sort of evolving I think that
you<00:04:38.620> know<00:04:38.710> we<00:04:38.890> have<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.130> experience<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:40.290> I

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
you know we have this experience so I

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.740 
you know we have this experience so I
think<00:04:41.920> bioshock<00:04:42.460> 1<00:04:42.490> new<00:04:42.790> sort<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.060> was<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.510> bit

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
think bioshock 1 new sort of was a bit

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.650 
think bioshock 1 new sort of was a bit
of<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.900> sleeper<00:04:44.260> hit<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:45.360> didn't<00:04:46.360> have<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.510> lot

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
of a sleeper hit and didn't have a lot

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.360 
of a sleeper hit and didn't have a lot
of<00:04:46.720> sort<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.260> marketing<00:04:47.680> budget<00:04:47.980> didn't<00:04:48.280> have

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
of sort of marketing budget didn't have

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.610 
of sort of marketing budget didn't have
a<00:04:48.430> lot<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.610> ability<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.240> reach<00:04:49.420> out<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:50.470> people

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
a lot of ability to reach out to people

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.440 
a lot of ability to reach out to people
and<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:50.980> think<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.310> whenever<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.180> end<00:04:52.330> up

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
and I think that whenever we end up

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.180 
and I think that whenever we end up
showing<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.900> people<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.440> lot<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:53.830> people<00:04:53.920> you
