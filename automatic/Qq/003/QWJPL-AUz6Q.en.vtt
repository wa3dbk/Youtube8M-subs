00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello today a fish and seafood soup and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.400
 we start by heating 4 liters of water 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.279
 in a pot with 2 bay leaves 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.090
 while it takes heat we peel 300 grams 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.090
 of prawns 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.660
 ah 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 the heads and skins of prawns 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.900
 we use them to make the broth 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.560
 we will also use a hake tail 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.780
 with his head and a couple of anglerfish bones 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.120
 but you can use what you have for 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 home this will be on fire 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 approximately is 35 or 40 minutes and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.579
 while this happens we open a kilo of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.449
 steamed mussels 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 as soon as they open, we remove them from the fire 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.980
 and we removed the shell 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 and those ugly beards that they have left 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.890
 the water of the mussels we're going to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.380
 take advantage of the soup 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.550
 and with the help of a colander and a cloth 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.550
 we will filter it clean 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.210
 the same thing that we have done with the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.240
 mussels we make with 300 grams of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.390
 clams 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.610
 as soon as they open we withdraw them and here 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.110
 I will leave your taste if what you want 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.150
 remove the shell or not 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 and the filtered water we add to that of 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 the mussels 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.100
 and we reserve it 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.080
 crushed four cloves of garlic 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.890
 and we add them to a pot with a good 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.890
 jet of olive oil 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.689
 peel and chop a couple of onions 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.400
 and we add with the garlic 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.830
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.630
 and let's let it be done slowly 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.020
 we have the broth ready and we put it 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.580
 we will stay warm and in it 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.580
 we will know 400 grams of monkfish 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.300
 let's say a little fresh parsley 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.730
 and we add it to the onion when 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.730
 be poached 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.380
 in two or three minutes we add the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.380
 saffron 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.040
 a couple of laps 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 and now it's the turn of the water of the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.950
 mussels and clams and a couple of 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.950
 fish broth cases 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.380
 and we 're going to let it cook for 15 or 20 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 minutes 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.680
 and even the monkfish ready and we removed it from 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.680
 fire 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.490
 i 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.100
 we removed the central spine 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.460
 some ugly skin that has remained and what 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.530
 we crumble with our hands 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.990
 You can do it with a knife but in my 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.250
 opinion is much better for this soup 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.250
 crumbled by hand 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.400
 the 20 minutes have passed and the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.379
 Onion is already completely ready 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.379
 and we crush it with the minipimer 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.080
 all this that we have crushed the onion 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.560
 crushed we add to the broth 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.560
 fish 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 we remove approximately one glass of 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.590
 this broth 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.620
 and we reserve it by letting it cool 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.620
 well this is about just before 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.230
 serve with the hot broth add 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.520
 the shrimp tails 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.460
 the shredded fish 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.919
 the mussels 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.120
 and the clams that I add with 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.300
 shell 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.940
 we leave them two or three minutes in the heat 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.720
 and it would be ready and it would be time to 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.960
 put salt 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.140
 As you can see I have not put salt in everything in 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.080
 all the video so I want the broth 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.790
 I have reserved it when it is cold 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.930
 if I want to give a little more body to 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:13.870
 the soup because I add a little bit of 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.480
 corn flour diluted it well 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.700
 and add it to the soup and with this the 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.700
 soup will catch a little more body 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.170
 good and this is the result I hope that 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.530
 you like it is a bit the odious but this 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.530
 exquisite
