let<00:00:11.890> me<00:00:11.980> tell<00:00:12.220> you<00:00:12.370> about<00:00:12.880> how<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.269> band<00:00:13.630> works

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
let me tell you about how the band works

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.470 
let me tell you about how the band works
and<00:00:14.620> how<00:00:14.769> it's<00:00:15.130> going<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.430> influence<00:00:15.760> your

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
and how it's going to influence your

of patients over nearly 20 years we've

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.359 
of patients over nearly 20 years we've
done<00:00:22.810> a<00:00:22.840> lot<00:00:23.110> of<00:00:23.140> research<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:24.010> we've<00:00:24.160> got

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
done a lot of research and we've got

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.760 
done a lot of research and we've got
some<00:00:24.550> exciting<00:00:24.970> new<00:00:25.330> research<00:00:25.930> on<00:00:26.230> just<00:00:26.529> how

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
some exciting new research on just how

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.700 
some exciting new research on just how
you<00:00:27.369> should<00:00:27.670> eat<00:00:27.699> after<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.570> band<00:00:28.840> our<00:00:29.350> new

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
you should eat after the band our new

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.580 
you should eat after the band our new
research<00:00:30.279> has<00:00:30.789> explained<00:00:31.420> really<00:00:31.810> well<00:00:32.230> how

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
research has explained really well how

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.520 
research has explained really well how
the<00:00:32.649> band<00:00:33.039> works<00:00:33.370> we<00:00:34.359> know<00:00:34.569> now<00:00:34.839> that<00:00:35.229> it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
the band works we know now that it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.279 
the band works we know now that it
doesn't<00:00:35.829> work<00:00:36.219> by<00:00:36.579> blocking<00:00:36.819> it<00:00:37.690> doesn't<00:00:38.079> work

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
doesn't work by blocking it doesn't work

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.520 
doesn't work by blocking it doesn't work
by<00:00:38.499> restricting<00:00:39.039> your<00:00:39.850> food<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.539> a<00:00:40.749> crude<00:00:41.139> way

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
by restricting your food in a crude way

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.849 
by restricting your food in a crude way
it<00:00:42.219> works<00:00:42.519> in<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.850> very<00:00:42.879> elegant<00:00:43.659> way<00:00:43.719> by<00:00:44.440> taking

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
it works in a very elegant way by taking

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.969 
it works in a very elegant way by taking
away<00:00:44.979> your<00:00:45.339> appetite<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.199> does<00:00:47.409> that<00:00:47.679> by

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
away your appetite and it does that by

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.799 
away your appetite and it does that by
squeezing<00:00:48.489> on<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> very<00:00:49.149> top<00:00:49.479> of<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.749> stomach

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
squeezing on the very top of the stomach

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.489 
squeezing on the very top of the stomach
the<00:00:50.769> adjustability<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:52.329> band<00:00:52.600> allows<00:00:53.170> us

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
the adjustability of the band allows us

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.979 
the adjustability of the band allows us
to<00:00:53.739> achieve<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:54.459> right<00:00:54.729> level<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.239> squeezing

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
to achieve the right level of squeezing

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.379 
to achieve the right level of squeezing
in<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.979> area<00:00:57.370> of<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.639> stomach<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:58.209> some

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389 
in that area of the stomach of some

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:00.090 
in that area of the stomach of some
nerve<00:00:58.629> endings<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.260> can<00:00:59.589> feel<00:00:59.859> that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
nerve endings that can feel that

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.430 
nerve endings that can feel that
pressure<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.819> they're<00:01:01.299> sending<00:01:01.569> signals<00:01:02.229> up

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
pressure and they're sending signals up

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.950 
pressure and they're sending signals up
to<00:01:02.589> your<00:01:02.739> brain<00:01:02.979> saying<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:04.420> stomach<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:04.930> full

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
to your brain saying the stomach is full

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.560 
to your brain saying the stomach is full
they<00:01:05.650> think<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.160> stomach<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.700> full<00:01:06.730> because

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
they think the stomach is full because

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
they think the stomach is full because
the<00:01:07.750> band<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.260> there<00:01:08.700> squeezing<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.820> area

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the band is there squeezing that area

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950 
the band is there squeezing that area
that's<00:01:11.560> squeezing<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:12.430> there<00:01:12.730> 24<00:01:13.480> hours<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.840> day

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
that's squeezing is there 24 hours a day

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's squeezing is there 24 hours a day
and<00:01:14.470> therefore<00:01:15.190> your<00:01:15.310> appetite<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:16.150> reduced

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
and therefore your appetite is reduced

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.410 
and therefore your appetite is reduced
for<00:01:17.080> 24<00:01:17.620> hours<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.950> day<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.820> wake<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
for 24 hours a day you wake up in the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.230 
for 24 hours a day you wake up in the
morning<00:01:19.810> not<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.050> hungry<00:01:20.650> you<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.610> get<00:01:21.820> hungry

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
morning not so hungry you can get hungry

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.510 
morning not so hungry you can get hungry
during<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.780> day<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.230> little<00:01:23.620> bit<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.460> you

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
during the day a little bit and so you

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.030 
during the day a little bit and so you
have<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> meal<00:01:25.120> that's<00:01:25.600> normal<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:26.530> want<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.950> to

eat we just want you to eat a very small
amount<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.640> do<00:01:30.850> eat<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.690> take<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.230> small

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
amount when you do eat you take a small

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.640 
amount when you do eat you take a small
bite<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.310> food<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:34.330> chew<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.750> well<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.440> then

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
bite of food you chew it well and then

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.070 
bite of food you chew it well and then
you<00:01:35.800> swallow<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.640> then<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.390> esophagus

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
you swallow it and then the esophagus

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.410 
you swallow it and then the esophagus
which<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> muscular<00:01:39.130> tube<00:01:39.210> passing<00:01:40.210> down

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
which is a muscular tube passing down

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.840 
which is a muscular tube passing down
through<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.870> chest<00:01:41.170> will<00:01:41.740> squeeze<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.550> bite

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
through the chest will squeeze that bite

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.899 
through the chest will squeeze that bite
of<00:01:43.030> food<00:01:43.300> down<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.350> across<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.250> band<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.790> as

of food down and across the band and as
it<00:01:46.060> squeezes<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.930> across<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.500> band<00:01:47.740> it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
it squeezes it across the band it

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.700 
it squeezes it across the band it
stimulates<00:01:49.210> these<00:01:49.480> nerve<00:01:49.870> endings<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.470> are

there even more and they're sending

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.850 
there even more and they're sending
further<00:01:53.350> signals<00:01:53.950> up<00:01:54.159> each<00:01:54.970> bite<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.510> food<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
further signals up each bite of food but

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.240 
further signals up each bite of food but
might<00:01:57.550> require<00:01:58.000> up<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.690> six<00:01:59.050> squeezes<00:01:59.770> to<00:02:00.040> get
