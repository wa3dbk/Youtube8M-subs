more buildings building big and small to
add<00:00:38.040> even<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.340> variety<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.570> let's<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.290> what

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you get in the latest expansion so here

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.690 
you get in the latest expansion so here
we<00:00:44.280> go

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
we go

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.029 
we go
this<00:00:45.539> arrived<00:00:45.840> today<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.710> opened

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this arrived today it's not been opened

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
this arrived today it's not been opened
yet<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> first<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:48.840> opening<00:00:49.100> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
yet this is the first time opening so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.630 
yet this is the first time opening so
let's<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.789> get

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
let's see what we get

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.959 
let's see what we get
ok<00:00:54.890> more<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:55.949> less<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.340> size<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.940> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ok more or less the same size if not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.569 
ok more or less the same size if not
identical<00:00:57.539> size<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> last<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.489> its

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
identical size to the last little its

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.189 
identical size to the last little its
function<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> second<00:01:00.899> expansion

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
function so this is the second expansion

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.520 
function so this is the second expansion
even<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.949> buildings<00:01:02.370> big<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> small

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530

just spoke reference there's the first

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.859 
just spoke reference there's the first
expansion<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.329> great

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
expansion which is great

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.429

loads<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.500> stuff<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.829> adding<00:01:53.070> variety<00:01:54.439> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
loads more stuff to adding variety so

expansion for our explanation of every

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.130 
expansion for our explanation of every
single<00:02:12.959> tile<00:02:14.030> which<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.209> good<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.699 

just<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.349> bolster<00:02:23.129> support<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> bottom<00:02:24.709> we

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
just a bolster support in the bottom we

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.869 
just a bolster support in the bottom we
could<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:25.980> made<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.220> box<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.519> little<00:02:26.640> bit

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
could have made the box a little bit

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.780 
could have made the box a little bit
slimmer<00:02:27.150> still<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.959> they<00:02:28.080> wanted<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.790> okay

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
slimmer still if they wanted to okay

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.530 
slimmer still if they wanted to okay
that's<00:02:30.599> interesting<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.980> never<00:02:32.790> really<00:02:33.180> run

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that's interesting I never really run

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.809 
that's interesting I never really run
into<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.989> at<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.470> beforehand<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.519> was<00:02:35.549> just

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
into this at all beforehand it was just

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.300 
into this at all beforehand it was just
an<00:02:35.940> instable<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.569> me<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.709> another

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
an instable for me you get another

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.589 
an instable for me you get another
expansion<00:02:39.060> piece<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.319> very<00:02:40.530> hungry

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
expansion piece which is very hungry
