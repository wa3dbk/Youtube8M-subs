00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
Series Concept Coupe is BMWs large coupe

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
Series Concept Coupe is BMWs large coupe
and<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:32.579> large<00:00:32.790> coupe<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.329> first

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and as a large coupe I think the first

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.700 
and as a large coupe I think the first
thing<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.719> need<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> evoke

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
thing you need to do is to evoke

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
thing you need to do is to evoke
emotions<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.450> should

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
emotions so the first thing we should

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
emotions so the first thing we should
talk<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
talk about is how we do that and that is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
talk about is how we do that and that is
actually<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> exterior<00:00:39.750> design<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
actually first the exterior design the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.650 
actually first the exterior design the
thing<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.680> catches<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> eye<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.660> so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
thing that catches the eye of first so

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
thing that catches the eye of first so
what<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.379> basically<00:00:44.129> an

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
what you see here is basically an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
what you see here is basically an
evolution<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> BMW<00:00:45.450> -<00:00:45.600> sign<00:00:45.840> language<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
evolution of BMW - sign language a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.459 
evolution of BMW - sign language a
careful<00:00:47.129> evolution<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.750> outgoing<00:00:49.170> 6

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
careful evolution of what the outgoing 6

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
careful evolution of what the outgoing 6
Series<00:00:49.710> represented<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.460> we've<00:00:50.579> added<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
Series represented but we've added and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
Series represented but we've added and
we've<00:00:51.300> basically<00:00:51.530> just<00:00:52.530> made<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> more

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
we've basically just made it more

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.650 
we've basically just made it more
stunning<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.820> right<00:00:54.059> we're<00:00:54.300> standing

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
stunning I think right we're standing

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
stunning I think right we're standing
more<00:00:54.809> muscular<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
more muscular I think you know kind of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.459 
more muscular I think you know kind of
more<00:00:56.520> animal-like<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> way<00:00:57.660> yeah<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> get

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
more animal-like in a way yeah you get

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.680 
more animal-like in a way yeah you get
rid<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:59.579> lurch<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.000> made<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> 3<00:01:00.449> inches

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
rid of a lurch we made it 3 inches

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.069 
rid of a lurch we made it 3 inches
longer

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
longer

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720 
longer
you<00:01:01.230> made<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.530> wider<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.309> made<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> lower

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you made it wider and we made it lower

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.179 
you made it wider and we made it lower
so<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> adds<00:01:03.809> muscle<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> car<00:01:04.769> plus

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so all that adds muscle to the car plus

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.649 
so all that adds muscle to the car plus
the<00:01:05.339> power<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.820> onto<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> street<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the power is more onto the street and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
the power is more onto the street and
gives<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> car<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> sense<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> wanting<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.400> get

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
gives the car a sense of wanting to get

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
gives the car a sense of wanting to get
comfy<00:01:08.880> also<00:01:09.090> made<00:01:09.240> them<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.930> longer

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
comfy also made them a little bit longer

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
comfy also made them a little bit longer
and<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.380> gives<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> sense<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and that gives it that sense of a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
and that gives it that sense of a
bonding<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.299> large<00:01:12.479> right<00:01:13.020> yeah<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
bonding too large right yeah and just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
bonding too large right yeah and just
power<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> power<00:01:15.360> under<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> hood

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
power because the power under the hood

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
power because the power under the hood
of<00:01:16.020> course<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> first<00:01:17.490> power<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of course and there is a first power on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.990 
of course and there is a first power on
the<00:01:18.030> road<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.770> updated<00:01:20.520> our<00:01:20.670> power

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the road we have updated our power

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.990 
the road we have updated our power
trains<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.560> most<00:01:23.369> people<00:01:23.670> use

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trains yeah you see now most people use

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.149 
trains yeah you see now most people use
false<00:01:24.570> induction<00:01:24.960> engines<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> 4.4

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
false induction engines this is a 4.4

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.649 
false induction engines this is a 4.4
liter<00:01:26.360> twin-turbo<00:01:27.360> v8<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.119> produces

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
liter twin-turbo v8 and that produces

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
liter twin-turbo v8 and that produces
you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> known<00:01:31.439> engine<00:01:31.740> Bruce's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you know it's a known engine Bruce's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
you know it's a known engine Bruce's
father<00:01:32.310> horsepower<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> almost<00:01:34.020> power<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
father horsepower and almost power is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
father horsepower and almost power is
just<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> number<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.860> 4.9<00:01:35.460> seconds<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.090> 60

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
just a number but 4.9 seconds to 60

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
just a number but 4.9 seconds to 60
that's<00:01:36.869> something<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> feel<00:01:37.439> absolutely
