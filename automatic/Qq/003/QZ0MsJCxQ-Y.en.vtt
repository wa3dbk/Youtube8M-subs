00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.379
 today's rv will be on lipsticks 31 m 68 hours 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 of qatar and those ct are six 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.480
 I have three that I didn't choose 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.120
 chosen of a mother in fact I do not know not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.880
 I know if 900 these three however the price 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.029
 it's about 5 euros I don't know in america 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.170
 craving 5 euros in Italy with 65 69 not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.699
 I'm 100% sure 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.699
 I'll show you three colors that I have 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.529
 this is the color 0 10 as you can 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 see on the mille perhaps not very recently 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 my lips are very similar to the cord 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 and honestly if you have lampano 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 you will not see enough pigmented 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 what you will see are just not boys 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 will have it particularly clear why 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 see from a very faint color 0 40 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.000
 this is 20 50 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 then we say that this one is that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.250
 pink the 0 10 is very different from the others 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.890
 two because it takes me very little is nice 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 it conceals itself then initially said 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.110
 a 3000 is not even seen as a reality 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 it's very nice but it doesn't last long 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.619
 there is a mess because it makes it seem like anyway 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 the lips a little more hydrated a little more 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.580
 big if very nice especially if 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 your lips are a little dry or if 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.680
 however, you want a slightly natural look 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
 but to a really little to me that is if 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.939
 I eat something I had something something 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 you can't see it anymore because after a while it wo n't 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.869
 last 8 hours but a little more colors 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.610
 dark the gloss pavia part remains however 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.619
 tint however on this is what so 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.450
 clear it's not doing anything because being 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.070
 however clear up a tint on my own 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 lips are not seen tivo so it is beautiful is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.189
 that there is the gloss part but when it goes away 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 for your part, nothing can be seen 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.259
 therefore useless while these two are 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 much nicer we say that long 18 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.009
 hours on me 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.930
 the gloss part of one of about two hours e 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.799
 an hour and a half and then the forest there 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.990
 tint 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.790
 sometimes that's depending on how you have it 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 lips if you have starting lips 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.350
 quite hydrated enough mass 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 well the interest is fairly uniform 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.229
 if instead the starter already has the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 lips a little if with a little 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.710
 cracking the color does not remain uniform 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.820
 so it gets pretty ugly like 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 effect 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.230
 and let's say that it lasts about me 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.810
 five hours the feint if I know of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.330
 not having chapped lips 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.340
 I put it because you know that the colors 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.570
 on the cracks they become darker and 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.459
 so you can see all the lips 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.260
 bits in which quickly ugly 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.220
 however otherwise it is very nice as 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.010
 effect for this product of the drums 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.780
 eight learned more than anything else 2 that 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.850
 that you see because obviously this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.800
 above is that I have to give them about me 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.370
 you can't see it so I can't 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.230
 give it a vote 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.910
 goal because on my lips you don't 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.160
 he sees nothing and leaves after a very short time 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.290
 however the two colors that you see the 0 40 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.800
 the 0 50 are really very nice 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.010
 they last long enough are beautiful not 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.930
 they cost a lot and put the pencil on them 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.170
 and transparent around it does not smudge is not 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.870
 also therefore a little product however to the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.870
 levels of mars more expensive than beauty
