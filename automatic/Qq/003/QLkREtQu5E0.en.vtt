like<00:00:25.649> most<00:00:26.009> about<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.550> watch<00:00:26.790> is<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
like most about this watch is the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.330 
like most about this watch is the
chronograph<00:00:27.930> feature<00:00:28.200> it's<00:00:28.559> very<00:00:28.829> simple

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
chronograph feature it's very simple

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
chronograph feature it's very simple
it's<00:00:29.610> easy<00:00:29.790> to<00:00:30.090> use<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.689> easy<00:00:30.899> to<00:00:31.020> read

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it's easy to use and it's easy to read

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's easy to use and it's easy to read
as<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.220> can<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> large<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.140> hand<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
as you can see the large second hand is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
as you can see the large second hand is
not<00:00:35.579> used<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> indicate<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.690> rather<00:00:37.110> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
not used to indicate time rather it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.080 
not used to indicate time rather it's
used<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> indicate<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.340> seconds<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
used to indicate you know seconds in the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790 
used to indicate you know seconds in the
chronograph<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.109> can<00:00:40.230> start<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
chronograph so we can start the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.490 
chronograph so we can start the
chronograph<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.429> simply<00:00:41.879> hitting<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.839> button

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> upper<00:00:43.769> right<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
on the upper right and you can see that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.029 
on the upper right and you can see that
it<00:00:45.660> starts<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.289> actually<00:00:46.589> a<00:00:46.620> sub

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it starts and there's actually a sub

you need
Seco<00:00:57.539> keeps<00:00:57.749> it<00:00:57.899> simple<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> watch

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
Seco keeps it simple on this watch

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
Seco keeps it simple on this watch
there's<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.569> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:00.870> extraneous<00:01:01.640> features

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
there's not a lot of extraneous features

there is a small sub dial with a nine
o'clock<00:01:04.739> position<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.580> shows<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> second

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
o'clock position that shows the second

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
o'clock position that shows the second
hand<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> clock<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.370> course<00:01:10.040> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
hand for the clock of course but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.780 
hand for the clock of course but
otherwise<00:01:11.810> keeping<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> simple<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.160> a<00:01:14.250> 43

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
otherwise keeping it simple so it's a 43

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.610 
otherwise keeping it simple so it's a 43
millimeter<00:01:15.240> case<00:01:15.540> diameter<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
millimeter case diameter and the

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.860 
millimeter case diameter and the
thickness<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.160> just<00:01:17.370> 11<00:01:17.640> millimeters<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.450> it's

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
thickness is just 11 millimeters so it's

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.790 
thickness is just 11 millimeters so it's
not<00:01:19.110> big<00:01:19.410> it's<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:20.190> bulky<00:01:21.350> another<00:01:22.350> another

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
not big it's not bulky another another

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.740 
not big it's not bulky another another
aspect<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.490> appreciate<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.660> of

matte finish stainless steel case it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.610 
matte finish stainless steel case it
looks<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:29.100> rugged<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.940> looks<00:01:30.210> tough<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
looks very rugged it looks tough but it

but it still has a an almost semi dressy
look<00:01:35.730> to<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.140> nice<00:01:37.320> clean

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
look to it because it's a nice clean

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.290 
look to it because it's a nice clean
uniform<00:01:38.340> look

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
keeping that military style of course
there<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> date<00:01:42.660> window<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> four

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
there is a date window at the four

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.330 
there is a date window at the four
o'clock<00:01:43.620> position<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> important<00:01:46.340> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
o'clock position which is important this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.220

impact<00:02:09.239> better<00:02:09.690> than<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> mineral<00:02:10.410> crystal<00:02:10.590> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
impact better than a mineral crystal so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.160 
impact better than a mineral crystal so
that's<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.180> nice<00:02:12.360> aspect<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.050> this

is 12 o'clock in the dark now one thing
to<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.840> aware<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.860> a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
to be aware of is that this is a a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.260 
to be aware of is that this is a a
lightweight<00:02:39.940> black<00:02:40.720> nylon<00:02:41.380> strap<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.270> not

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
lightweight black nylon strap and not

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.210 
lightweight black nylon strap and not
only<00:02:43.540> does<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.440> watch<00:02:44.620> overall

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
only does this make the watch overall

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190 
only does this make the watch overall
lighter<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.540> my<00:02:46.660> opinion<00:02:47.050> more

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
lighter and in my opinion more

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.180 
lighter and in my opinion more
comfortable<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:49.770> reduces<00:02:50.770> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
comfortable but it really reduces the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.250 
comfortable but it really reduces the
overall<00:02:51.459> price<00:02:51.880> tag<00:02:52.150> significantly<00:02:52.870> making

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
overall price tag significantly making

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.520 
overall price tag significantly making
this<00:02:53.380> making<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.130> quite<00:02:54.400> affordable<00:02:55.530> it's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
this making this quite affordable it's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.740 
this making this quite affordable it's
it's<00:02:56.890> not<00:02:57.100> necessarily<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.970> highest<00:02:58.390> quality

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it's not necessarily the highest quality

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's not necessarily the highest quality
strap<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.590> world<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:01.390> would<00:03:01.570> be

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
strap in the world but it would be

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.870 
strap in the world but it would be
easily<00:03:01.930> easily<00:03:02.440> replaceable<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.250> again<00:03:03.730> at

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
easily easily replaceable and again at

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.780 
easily easily replaceable and again at
the<00:03:03.970> price<00:03:04.209> tag<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.770> great<00:03:05.980> value<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.670> if

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the price tag it's a great value so if
