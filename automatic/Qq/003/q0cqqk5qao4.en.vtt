00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.439
 we are here to introduce you a new one 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 of the last gems of the uncle company 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 ciro poses in the Italian way is evolution 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.920
 of immediately cooked for nothing at once 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 cooked only 80 of some improvements 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.050
 xi special edition then yes 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 differentiates from the old immediately cooked 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.670
 this special edition for your plan 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.200
 in fired refractory made with 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.950
 refractory clay equivalent to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 sorrento biscuit then we have the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 new domes the domes are made 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.789
 with meal for professional fund 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.570
 made with molten cement and grit 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.570
 refractory 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.109
 so at this point the fund will have a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 upper thermal flywheel ie it will keep 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.260
 better heat than the old one 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.720
 version 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 finally we have a greater layer of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.450
 insulation both in the lower part and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 at the top then we find ourselves 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.610
 today here with the use of this point 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.909
 he says to make our beloved pans e 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 unfortunately I love pizza in the pan 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.830
 even if the desire is so much to find 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.009
 a Neapolitan with this fund that 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.939
 surely it is the right use then 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.630
 today's pizza will be 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.249
 fennel parmigiana of course for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.140
 to remedy the problems that we provide to 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:45.119
 wood for our pizza pan 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.539
 we will use a method that thanking god 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.509
 there are those who invented it for us or who 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.000

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.829
 after covering it with parchment paper 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:17.540

 almost that perfume lacks just a touch 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.890
