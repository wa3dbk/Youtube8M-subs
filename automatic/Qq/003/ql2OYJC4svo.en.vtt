got a little a sand trap over here I

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.190 
got a little a sand trap over here I
guess<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.610> Gordo<00:01:37.940> patrolling<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.780> border

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.850 

thankfully<00:01:42.200> though<00:01:42.320> since<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> first

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
thankfully though since it's the first

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.380 
thankfully though since it's the first
shot<00:01:43.250> if<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.400> mess<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.640> up<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.970> can<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.270> hit

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
shot if you mess it up you can just hit

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.670 
shot if you mess it up you can just hit
restart<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:46.190> know<00:01:46.660> start<00:01:47.660> over<00:01:47.750> no<00:01:48.500> big

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
restart and you know start over no big

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.460 
restart and you know start over no big
deal<00:01:49.420> it's<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> pretty<00:01:50.630> easy<00:01:50.720> shot<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.320> once

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
deal it's a pretty easy shot that once

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.200 
deal it's a pretty easy shot that once
you<00:01:51.590> figure<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:51.979> out<00:01:52.100> just<00:01:52.670> three<00:01:52.820> quarters

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
you figure it out just three quarters

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.530 
you figure it out just three quarters
simple<00:01:54.080> jump<00:01:54.790> but<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:55.910> shots<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.270> little<00:01:56.450> bit

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
simple jump but this shots a little bit

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.630 
simple jump but this shots a little bit
