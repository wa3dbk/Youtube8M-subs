00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
machine is working or not so i will

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
machine is working or not so i will
choose<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:54.379> new<00:00:55.379> machine<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.760> will

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
choose a new machine here and i will

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.529 
choose a new machine here and i will
give<00:00:57.300> its<00:00:57.449> name<00:00:58.100> freenas<00:01:00.559> freenas<00:01:01.789> be<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.359> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
give its name freenas freenas be so this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.990 
give its name freenas freenas be so this
is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> bsd<00:01:04.260> system<00:01:04.680> freebsd<00:01:05.930> next<00:01:06.930> its<00:01:07.890> ram<00:01:08.430> 512

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
is a bsd system freebsd next its ram 512

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.289 
is a bsd system freebsd next its ram 512
is<00:01:09.360> enough<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.700> hard<00:01:11.970> disk

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
is enough for me and then it's hard disk

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.820 
is enough for me and then it's hard disk
i<00:01:12.770> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.270> create<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> new<00:01:15.659> hard<00:01:15.930> disk<00:01:16.140> freenas

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
i need to create a new hard disk freenas

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.080 
i need to create a new hard disk freenas
boot<00:01:17.450> any<00:01:18.450> name<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> give<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.520> doesn't

need much space 128 256 mb is enough for

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
need much space 128 256 mb is enough for
me<00:01:30.259> then<00:01:31.259> finish

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.070 

talking<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.960> because<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> already<00:01:37.950> one

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
talking now because there is already one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.150 
talking now because there is already one
CD<00:01:40.340> iso<00:01:41.340> file<00:01:41.580> which<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:43.560> attach<00:01:43.860> with

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
CD iso file which i have to attach with

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.640 
CD iso file which i have to attach with
this<00:01:44.430> machine<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.080> boot<00:01:46.410> from

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
this machine so that i can boot from

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.400 
this machine so that i can boot from
there<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> storage<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.110> seed<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
there so you go to storage the seed is

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.760 
there so you go to storage the seed is
there<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.280> i<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.940> attach<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> freeness<00:01:52.440> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there and i will attach the freeness is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
there and i will attach the freeness is
0<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.340> already<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:54.560> ok<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
0 which is already there ok now this is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
0 which is already there ok now this is
attached<00:02:00.890> ok<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.040> boot<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.820> system<00:02:03.000> now

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
attached ok I will boot the system now

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.609 
attached ok I will boot the system now
so<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.150> will<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.420> booting<00:02:07.790> with<00:02:08.790> this<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:09.989> 0<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
so it will be booting with this is 0 and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.479 
so it will be booting with this is 0 and
you<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.940> booting<00:02:12.390> from<00:02:12.420> CD<00:02:13.489> once

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
you can see it's booting from CD once

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.570 
you can see it's booting from CD once
this<00:02:14.820> screen<00:02:15.180> appears<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:15.930> choose<00:02:16.770> option
