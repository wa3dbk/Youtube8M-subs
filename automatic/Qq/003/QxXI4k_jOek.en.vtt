00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.310 
might make a video about that but I
don't<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.540> guns<00:01:34.689> or<00:01:34.869> billboards<00:01:35.229> but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
don't like guns or billboards but

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.890 
don't like guns or billboards but
tourists<00:01:35.770> likes<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.689> guns

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
tourists likes to do that but the guns

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.719 
tourists likes to do that but the guns
themselves<00:01:38.079> are<00:01:38.500> looking<00:01:38.799> very<00:01:38.829> interesting

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
themselves are looking very interesting

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.399 
themselves are looking very interesting
we<00:01:39.820> probably<00:01:40.000> sand<00:01:40.329> off<00:01:40.509> that<00:01:40.750> laser<00:01:41.079> etching

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
we probably sand off that laser etching

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.679 
we probably sand off that laser etching
if<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.590> wanted<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.009> on<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.250> side<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.479> also

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
if you wanted to on the side and also

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.590 
if you wanted to on the side and also
some<00:01:44.079> of<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.229> poly<00:01:44.500> revolvers<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
some of the poly revolvers the the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.760 
some of the poly revolvers the the
revolvers<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.630> series<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.229> got<00:01:50.409> coming<00:01:50.619> out

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
revolvers that series I got coming out

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.069 
revolvers that series I got coming out
now<00:01:51.070> I'm<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.790> little<00:01:51.970> light-headed<00:01:52.570> from<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
now I'm a little light-headed from the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.170 
now I'm a little light-headed from the
JEM<00:01:53.259> steel<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:53.680> can't<00:01:53.920> really<00:01:54.100> think<00:01:54.399> but

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
JEM steel so I can't really think but

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.399 
JEM steel so I can't really think but
the<00:01:55.270> polymer<00:01:55.659> revolvers<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.259> they're

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
the polymer revolvers that they're

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.870 
the polymer revolvers that they're
making<00:01:56.680> are<00:01:56.799> very<00:01:56.829> cool-looking<00:01:57.340> some<00:01:57.790> of

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
making are very cool-looking some of

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.730 
making are very cool-looking some of
them<00:01:58.000> look<00:01:58.149> really<00:01:58.689> interesting<00:01:58.930> especially

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
them look really interesting especially

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.959 
them look really interesting especially
with<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.219> ones<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.670> stainless

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
with the ones that have the stainless

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.149 
with the ones that have the stainless
lock<00:02:01.329> ups<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.750> nuts<00:02:01.960> cylinders<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
lock ups and nuts cylinders in the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.459 
lock ups and nuts cylinders in the
polymer<00:02:03.670> frames<00:02:03.969> very<00:02:04.750> interesting<00:02:05.170> looking

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
polymer frames very interesting looking

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.020 
polymer frames very interesting looking
so<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.070> don't<00:02:06.460> know<00:02:06.520> how<00:02:06.640> many<00:02:06.700> people<00:02:06.939> have

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
so I don't know how many people have

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.249 
so I don't know how many people have
been<00:02:07.090> keeping<00:02:07.329> up<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.689> tourists<00:02:08.079> I<00:02:08.200> know

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
been keeping up with tourists I know

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.229 
been keeping up with tourists I know
it's<00:02:08.470> not<00:02:08.590> vogue<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.250> say<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.459> like<00:02:09.790> Taurus

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
it's not vogue to say you like Taurus

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.449 
it's not vogue to say you like Taurus
but<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.170> might<00:02:11.349> be<00:02:11.470> worth<00:02:11.590> taking<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.040> look<00:02:12.280> at

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
but it might be worth taking a look at

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.900 
but it might be worth taking a look at
lately<00:02:12.700> cuz

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
lately cuz

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
lately cuz
seen<00:02:13.180> some<00:02:13.330> pretty<00:02:13.450> interesting<00:02:13.660> guns<00:02:14.080> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
seen some pretty interesting guns and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.930 
seen some pretty interesting guns and
I've<00:02:14.740> noticed<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.190> started<00:02:15.490> making<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.760> lot<00:02:15.910> of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
I've noticed I started making a lot of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.370 
I've noticed I started making a lot of
their<00:02:16.120> parts<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.480> America<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.080> some<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.290> their

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
their parts in America and some of their

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.200 
their parts in America and some of their
guns<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.740> America<00:02:18.160> they've<00:02:18.640> really<00:02:18.940> stepped

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
guns in America they've really stepped

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.900 
guns in America they've really stepped
up<00:02:19.330> their<00:02:19.510> quality<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.960> their<00:02:20.170> production

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
up their quality of their production

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.700 
up their quality of their production
techniques<00:02:21.910> lately<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.810> they<00:02:23.230> might<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.650> be

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
techniques lately so they might just be

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.410 
techniques lately so they might just be
an<00:02:23.890> up-and-coming<00:02:24.280> gun<00:02:24.550> maker<00:02:24.760> who<00:02:24.970> ten<00:02:25.210> years

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
an up-and-coming gun maker who ten years

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.450 
an up-and-coming gun maker who ten years
from<00:02:25.480> now<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.780> may<00:02:25.960> not<00:02:25.990> be<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.680> out<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.160> vogue

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
from now it may not be so out of vogue

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.280 
from now it may not be so out of vogue
to<00:02:27.640> say<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.820> left<00:02:28.060> Taurus<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.140> haven't

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
to say you left Taurus so if you haven't

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.840 
to say you left Taurus so if you haven't
checked<00:02:29.620> them<00:02:29.710> out<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.190> you're<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.490> me<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
checked them out and you're like me and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.600 
checked them out and you're like me and
you're<00:02:30.940> interested<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.450> new<00:02:31.570> technologies
