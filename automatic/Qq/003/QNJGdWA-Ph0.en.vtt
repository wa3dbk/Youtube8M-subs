and<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:10.300> some<00:03:10.420> reason<00:03:10.450> when<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.900> think

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and for some reason when I think

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.910 
and for some reason when I think
Valentine's<00:03:12.220> Day<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.400> think<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.730> lovely<00:03:13.090> flavor

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
Valentine's Day I think of lovely flavor

Valentine's Day I think of lovely flavor
on<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> Y

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.860 

but<00:03:23.019> it's<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.319> small<00:03:23.470> that's<00:03:24.370> tiny<00:03:24.790> drink<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.720> my

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
but it's a small that's tiny drink so my

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.289 
but it's a small that's tiny drink so my
guess<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.079> it's<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:27.579> just<00:03:27.909> enough

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
guess is it's going to be just enough

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.390 
guess is it's going to be just enough
you<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.379> maybe<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.680> start<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.099> night

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
you know maybe to start out the night

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.960 
you know maybe to start out the night
but<00:03:30.879> you<00:03:31.000> probably<00:03:31.209> wouldn't<00:03:31.569> be<00:03:32.970> sucking

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
but you probably wouldn't be sucking

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.940 
but you probably wouldn't be sucking
back<00:03:34.150> 20<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.230> these<00:03:35.319> things<00:03:35.560> because<00:03:35.769> that
