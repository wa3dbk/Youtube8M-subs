00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.580 

I'd<00:00:25.970> say<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:26.240> some<00:00:26.420> ways

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

I<00:00:37.460> think<00:00:38.060> on<00:00:38.210> first<00:00:38.510> impressions<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.200> bit

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
I think on first impressions is a bit

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.510 
I think on first impressions is a bit
disheartening<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.010> when<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.280> look<00:00:40.400> again

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 

I<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.540> want<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.380> when<00:00:46.560> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

I just want to see more of it when you
see<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.950> exciting<00:00:47.370> stuff<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.120> by

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
see the exciting stuff I just think by

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.740 
see the exciting stuff I just think by
the<00:00:48.690> wires<00:00:48.990> no<00:00:49.260> more

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
the wires no more

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.780 
the wires no more
and<00:00:51.080> what<00:00:51.380> we're<00:00:51.560> on<00:00:51.770> is<00:00:51.950> missing<00:00:52.280> people<00:00:52.610> here

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
and what we're on is missing people here

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.910 
and what we're on is missing people here
who<00:00:53.030> are<00:00:53.060> no

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920

my<00:00:55.920> Christmas

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
my Christmas

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
my Christmas
that<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.649> true<00:00:58.860> of<00:00:58.980> years<00:00:59.250> gone<00:00:59.309> by<00:00:59.460> as

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that was that true of years gone by as

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
that was that true of years gone by as
well<00:00:59.940> yeah<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> last<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.410> judge

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
well yeah I think the last time I judge

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
well yeah I think the last time I judge
I'd<00:01:01.860> say<00:01:02.040> exactly<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.579> same<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.750> was

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I'd say exactly the same thing that was

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
I'd say exactly the same thing that was
also<00:01:04.199> hope

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.760 

it's<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.899> changed<00:01:07.259> you<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.619> one<00:01:07.740> thing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it's not changed you actually one thing

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
it's not changed you actually one thing
that<00:01:08.039> it<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.280> been<00:01:08.310> quite<00:01:08.579> positive<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.149> more

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that it has been quite positive as more

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.550 
that it has been quite positive as more
international<00:01:10.140> entry<00:01:12.170> lots<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.259> different

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
international entry lots of different

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.520 
international entry lots of different
countries<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:13.979> that's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.960 

without<00:01:20.530> any<00:01:20.680> trends<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.280> think

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.720 

I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.740> happens<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.160> illustration<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
I think what happens in illustration is

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.270 
I think what happens in illustration is
a<00:01:26.760> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> advertising<00:01:27.540> company<00:01:28.070> could<00:01:29.070> work

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a lot of advertising company could work

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
a lot of advertising company could work
into<00:01:29.640> illustration<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.660> that<00:01:31.290> tends<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
into illustration and that that tends to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.070 
into illustration and that that tends to
be<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.160> lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.490> pastiche<00:01:32.970> work<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> sometimes

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
be a lot of pastiche work and sometimes

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.470 
be a lot of pastiche work and sometimes
not<00:01:34.440> always<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.830> best<00:01:35.010> work<00:01:35.390> they're<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
not always the best work they're the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.970 
not always the best work they're the
ones<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:36.900> budget<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.950> enter

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
ones that have a budget to do to enter

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.880 
ones that have a budget to do to enter
so<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.000> tend<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.330> swamp<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.890> initiation

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so they tend to swamp the initiation

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.820 
so they tend to swamp the initiation
section<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.370> their<00:01:41.550> work

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
section with their work

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.380 

that's<00:01:44.070> where<00:01:44.340> sometimes<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:44.910> very<00:01:45.060> good

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that's where sometimes it's very good

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
that's where sometimes it's very good
excellent<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.530> lot<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.190> time<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.550> tends<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
excellent a lot of the time it tends to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.000 
excellent a lot of the time it tends to
be<00:01:47.880> oh<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.450> need

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.400 

pastiche<00:01:51.520> solution<00:01:52.420> will<00:01:52.570> use<00:01:52.690> illustration

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
pastiche solution will use illustration

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.010 
pastiche solution will use illustration
and<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:54.460> wish<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.880> would<00:01:55.030> change<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.570> again

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
and I wish that would change that again

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.780 
and I wish that would change that again

but knowing
and<00:03:17.459> were<00:03:17.970> there<00:03:18.150> big<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.870> arguments<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620

debates over the word or did it seem

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.240

obvious<00:03:21.209> which<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.290> going<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.560> first

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
obvious which one is going to first

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.809 
obvious which one is going to first
lively<00:03:26.030> debate<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.420> think<00:03:26.900> there's<00:03:27.050> an

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
lively debate I think there's an

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.390 
lively debate I think there's an
since<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.420> almost<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:29.930> has<00:03:30.049> split<00:03:30.260> into<00:03:30.439> two

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
since it is almost on has split into two

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.670 
since it is almost on has split into two
groups<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:31.969> and<00:03:32.120> there<00:03:32.329> but<00:03:32.719> i<00:03:32.989> think<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
groups of here and there but i think the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.050 
groups of here and there but i think the
stuff<00:03:33.889> that's<00:03:34.069> good<00:03:34.280> seems<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.639> slip<00:03:34.849> in

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
stuff that's good seems to slip in

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.770 
stuff that's good seems to slip in
really<00:03:35.299> quickly

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.360 

there's<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.470> couple<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.980> couple<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.280> issues

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
were also quite surprised but I think

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.590
