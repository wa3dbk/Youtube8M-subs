00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.600
 and to deepen the theme take Brazil now promotes in their studios the sock 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.349
 on embryonic stem cell research here in 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.129
 São Paulo is a specialist in bioethics of unifesp and alex teacher 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.910
 that is contrary to the liberation of this type of research 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 in our studio in rio de janeiro is the doctor and researcher laudelino 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.690
 Marquez pencil 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.120
 which is favorable to the release of polls good night I would like each 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.740
 one of you would justify your position first sign of the current 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.540
 government 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.970
 during this year 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 the captain studies regenerative medicine 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 and came to stay I usually say that we are not prefacing the future 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.060
 simply the future has already started cell therapy is a therapy already 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.760
 restored 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 it's as said 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 previously 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.720
 There is a lot of study to be done. 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.770
 we surely have as researchers 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 our people doubts are not sure which ones will be to taste more 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.840
 for therapy 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 but what we need to break the paradigm turn the page 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.290
 stop practicing just one healing medicine 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 we are becoming farther west 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800
 Hehehe 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.460
 It is necessary that we go in humus 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 and Brazil in this province and are deeply proud of these studies 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.740
 it is meritorious that there are debates but if I really wanted us to stay 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 a little removed from this polemic of this dichotomy between politics 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.479
 religion and science science has to walk 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.590
 must walk 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109
 our Brazilians 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.709
 we are walking very well walking in safe steps and with great humility 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.830
 in this sense 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.200
 now we would like to hear the position of teacher lenise 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 trench that is in São Paulo 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 ah we have to 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.789
 Who is injured adpf? 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.139
 the colleague 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.239
 is that they are working 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.879
 we then have more than 600 protocols 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.309
 who had entered the good results with a stem cells 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.639
 adults 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.029
 with embryonic cells but will have no cure so far 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.759
 The ministers are also not at all favorable. 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.200
 besides what he 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.639
 we have other sources of cells 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.129
 ah the millionaire are characteristic embryonic that can be obtained 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.629
 given from cells 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.419
 adults 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.529
 it was a great success the new author manata last year 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
 and currently the nobody advantage 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.930
 is putting in and parcels in a way 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.249
 much more efficient a thousand times more efficient 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.219
 and in a much faster way 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.929
 they did then 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.619
 I had obtained it from my retina 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.619
 in force on 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.129
 but he will be taken to prison with a death sentence in more than 20 countries in the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.699
 world of art with one shot 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.389
 the embryonic stem cell research in the case if Brazil does not 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.049
 do the research first we will stay dependent on these other countries and 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.979
 How will the three men stay in you? 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.099
 years had a single child that deals with the same theme 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.319
 with adult stem cells 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.399
 relation to other countries. 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:51.379
 the own promotion manager who was the first to develop 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.190
 cells 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.299
 culture of human embryonic cells 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.639
 he has already changed the line the state works in the past they 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.199
 induced pluripotency 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.210
 lulinha in the middle and mutilated and scotland 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.980
 He eat 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.069
 he is the one from this new line 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.239
 tereza is that the labor countries that have approved is because in these countries 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.239
 there is also abortion approval 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.689
 ef 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.770
 they noticed a human embryo 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.770
 a note 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.389
 But let's go Brasilia was marked 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.669
 teacher, my question is the following once approved 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.699
 aereb released searches with its ballast a kuimbila in areas like avoid 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.330
 a little pepper action these little humans these 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 embryos avoid for example that the 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.229
 it's a trivialization 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.229
 within the question one needs to be very careful there is such a risk 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.150
 yours 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.749
 remark and ask excellent 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.490
 lf tel if this too that we 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.120
 we end up with this fallacy of embryonic cells we were half as 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 doctors as researchers 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.590
 we have a commitment to life not to the destruction of life 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.990
 this is 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.240
 It's not for death, it's for creating, it's for improving. 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.999
 and to save 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:36.309
 fcc billions of embryos frozen frozen pedestrians in clinics 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.839
 from the didi reproduction side 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.369
 it's between the stereotypes we know we've always loved will be thrown away 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.089
 after three years 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.689
 I would like to hear a justification is with 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.370
 scientific substantiation 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.339
 gift severino throw these embryos off no one is talking in colony 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.169
 No one is talking about creating to destroy we're talking about 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.809
 use of these cells 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.830
 Unfortunately I disagree with Professor Lissi. 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.750
 we are not so well and we are not realizing with the 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.120
 completely using stem cells are 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.030
 She is the author of the Sultan. 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.780
 if we 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.280
 if we saw a publication in the bid juno a short time ago in the same 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.080
 edition germany publish a report usama sprawled with his hand 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.889
 and in heart disease 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.419
 and Norway in the same edition shows that these cells 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.869
 trunk is 

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:36.610
 it is not embryonic 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.020
 therefore we know very little but we need the small donation of 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.710
 to learn said 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.740
 we should as scientists with researchers 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.950
 that is the people who deal with the needs and productive here come 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.270
 create embryos simply to destroy them 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.759
 the idea is not destruction is not the greatest 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.570
 it is not 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.389
 end 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.620
 I agree with the service to use the refusal of new 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.830
 and new treatments we do not know yet 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.509
 with the best jungle we are studying and find the shiva mind other sources 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.319
 hahahaha the idea 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.429
 one more source should not be that it absolutely has 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.069
 it simply for the sake of 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.069
 convictions not scientifically proven 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:36.050
 our thanks then 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.719
 the ducts laudelino lopes 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.999
 and the researcher the crisis has been a big thank you to both
