I feel qualified now to tell you what

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.890 
I feel qualified now to tell you what
they<00:00:22.689> did<00:00:22.990> literally<00:00:23.560> two<00:00:24.070> days<00:00:24.339> ago<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:24.970> can't

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
they did literally two days ago I can't

they did literally two days ago I can't
tell<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.169> what<00:00:26.320> they<00:00:26.410> do<00:00:26.470> now<00:00:26.800> because<00:00:27.339> that

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
tell you what they do now because that

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.730 
tell you what they do now because that
would<00:00:28.390> be<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:28.810> strike<00:00:29.140> on<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.410> channel<00:00:29.679> and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
would be a strike on the channel and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.409 
would be a strike on the channel and
that's<00:00:29.890> no<00:00:30.039> good<00:00:30.070> but<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:30.789> can<00:00:31.060> tell<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.300> what

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
that's no good but I can tell you what

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.330 
that's no good but I can tell you what
they<00:00:31.509> did<00:00:31.689> which<00:00:31.869> is<00:00:31.900> brilliant<00:00:32.200> because<00:00:33.070> this

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
they did which is brilliant because this

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340 
they did which is brilliant because this
is<00:00:33.510> potentially<00:00:34.510> never<00:00:34.750> going<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.110> come<00:00:35.290> back

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
is potentially never going to come back

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.110 
is potentially never going to come back
which<00:00:35.740> is<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> shame<00:00:36.220> because<00:00:36.280> actually<00:00:36.940> was

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
which is a shame because actually was

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.390 
which is a shame because actually was
good<00:00:37.330> but<00:00:37.870> I've<00:00:38.020> heard<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.740> new<00:00:39.040> idea

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
good but I've heard that the new idea

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.880 
good but I've heard that the new idea
was<00:00:39.520> even<00:00:39.940> better<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.360> that's<00:00:40.690> cool<00:00:40.960> now<00:00:41.740> when

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
was even better so that's cool now when

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.320 
was even better so that's cool now when
you<00:00:41.980> were<00:00:42.040> building<00:00:42.190> your<00:00:42.460> nav<00:00:42.610> card<00:00:42.880> tables

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
you were building your nav card tables

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.260 
you were building your nav card tables
on<00:00:43.510> transit<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.060> thyroids<00:00:46.060> you<00:00:46.180> were

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
on transit and thyroids you were

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.090 
on transit and thyroids you were
collecting<00:00:46.660> whatever<00:00:46.990> it's<00:00:47.230> five<00:00:47.410> pieces<00:00:47.710> and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
collecting whatever it's five pieces and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.830 
collecting whatever it's five pieces and
building<00:00:48.880> them<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.090> then<00:00:49.210> inserting<00:00:49.510> one<00:00:49.750> of

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
building them and then inserting one of

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360 
building them and then inserting one of
the<00:00:49.900> nav<00:00:50.020> cards<00:00:50.320> from<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.530> other<00:00:50.680> map<00:00:50.950> into

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
the nav cards from the other map into

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.590 
the nav cards from the other map into
the<00:00:51.460> other<00:00:51.610> one<00:00:51.790> apart<00:00:52.030> from<00:00:52.120> you<00:00:52.240> couldn't<00:00:52.480> do

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
the other one apart from you couldn't do

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.120 
the other one apart from you couldn't do
it<00:00:52.720> you<00:00:52.840> couldn't<00:00:53.020> vice<00:00:53.260> versa<00:00:53.830> with<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
it you couldn't vice versa with the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.220 
it you couldn't vice versa with the
transit<00:00:54.580> card<00:00:54.790> sorry<00:00:55.360> with<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.540> dice<00:00:55.960> card

would've but then I've caught in that's

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.719 
would've but then I've caught in that's
the<00:01:55.090> entire<00:01:55.479> basis<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.320> nav<00:01:57.280> Cod<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
the entire basis of the nav Cod and the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.060 
the entire basis of the nav Cod and the
reason<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.210> was<00:01:58.270> there<00:01:58.650> what's<00:01:59.650> even<00:02:00.040> better

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
reason it was there what's even better

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.300 
reason it was there what's even better
is<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.869> game<00:02:02.140> type<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.190> of

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
is that that game type there's one of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.020 
is that that game type there's one of
two<00:02:03.340> game<00:02:03.670> types<00:02:03.970> on<00:02:04.740> transit<00:02:05.740> if<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.640> put<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
two game types on transit if you put the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.769 
two game types on transit if you put the
nav<00:02:07.180> card<00:02:07.479> from<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.099> transit<00:02:09.779> table

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:10.779 
nav card from into the transit table

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.710 
nav card from into the transit table
then

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240 
then
depending<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.530> side<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> Easter

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
depending on which side of the Easter

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.820 
depending on which side of the Easter
Egg<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.370> did<00:02:14.670> Maxis<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.540> Richthofen<00:02:16.140> you'd

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
Egg you did Maxis is a Richthofen you'd

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.730 
Egg you did Maxis is a Richthofen you'd
have<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> different<00:02:17.370> game<00:02:17.490> type<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.390> menu

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
have a different game type on your menu

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.830 
have a different game type on your menu
which<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> reason<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> redo<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.510> Easter

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
which is a reason to redo the Easter

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
which is a reason to redo the Easter
eggs<00:02:21.960> again<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.890> again<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.310> again<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
eggs again and again and again so you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.170 
eggs again and again and again so you
can<00:02:23.850> play<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.330> different<00:02:24.900> types<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.650> game<00:02:26.190> now

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
can play the different types of game now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.130 
can play the different types of game now
without<00:02:27.540> giving<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> game<00:02:28.710> type<00:02:29.250> names

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
without giving you the game type names

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.060 
without giving you the game type names
because<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.350> might<00:02:32.040> still<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.300> around<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:34.470> can

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
because that might still be around I can

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.070 
because that might still be around I can
tell<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.340> this

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
tell you this

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
tell you this
they<00:02:37.080> were<00:02:37.140> map<00:02:37.470> based<00:02:37.710> obviously<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.610> were

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
they were map based obviously they were

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.870 
they were map based obviously they were
short<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:40.380> had<00:02:40.560> an<00:02:40.680> objective<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
short and they had an objective and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.930 
short and they had an objective and
ending<00:02:42.780> essentially<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.740> each<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.640> them<00:02:44.760> had

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
ending essentially and each of them had

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.480 
ending essentially and each of them had
something<00:02:45.390> different<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.250> they<00:02:47.340> all

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
something different to do but they all

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.920 
something different to do but they all
had<00:02:47.670> an<00:02:47.820> objective<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.420> you'd<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
had an objective that you'd have to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.530 
had an objective that you'd have to
complete<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.500> kind<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:50.820> race<00:02:51.060> against<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
complete I kind of not race against the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.000 
complete I kind of not race against the
clock<00:02:51.600> thing<00:02:51.990> but<00:02:52.170> something<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.680> dissimilar

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
clock thing but something not dissimilar

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.640 
clock thing but something not dissimilar
to<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.510> would<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.780> unlocked<00:02:55.260> with

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
to that and it would be unlocked with

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
to that and it would be unlocked with
insertion<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> nav<00:02:56.730> card<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> think<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
insertion of the nav card now I think a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090 
insertion of the nav card now I think a
lot<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.260> people<00:02:58.470> are<00:02:58.560> going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.710> think<00:02:58.770> all

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
lot of people are going to think all

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.640 
lot of people are going to think all
that<00:02:59.310> shit<00:02:59.820> because<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.210> thought<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.440> nav

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that shit because I thought that the nav

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
that shit because I thought that the nav
card<00:03:02.010> would<00:03:02.370> open<00:03:02.820> up<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.060> new<00:03:03.240> room<00:03:03.510> full<00:03:03.930> of

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
card would open up a new room full of

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.160 
card would open up a new room full of
weapons<00:03:04.500> arsenal<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.520> teleport<00:03:06.510> me<00:03:06.690> back<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
weapons arsenal or teleport me back to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.000 
weapons arsenal or teleport me back to
Naxos<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:08.360> however<00:03:09.360> nice<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:10.080> sounds<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
Naxos I however nice that sounds and it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.520 
Naxos I however nice that sounds and it
does<00:03:11.190> sound<00:03:11.520> nice<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.930> completely

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
does sound nice it's completely

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.070 
does sound nice it's completely

unfeasible the maps as you see them now

could not fit a damn thing in them I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.590 
could not fit a damn thing in them I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600

anything could crash a map in fact were

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
anything could crash a map in fact were
more<00:03:27.570> than<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> dead<00:03:27.870> they<00:03:27.990> have<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.260> take

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
more than the dead they have to take

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
more than the dead they have to take
boards<00:03:28.800> off<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.950> windows<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.940> get<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
boards off the windows just to get the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.750 
boards off the windows just to get the
map<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.480> work<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> mean<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.340> kind<00:03:32.640> of

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
map to work so I mean it's that kind of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.660 
map to work so I mean it's that kind of
level<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> you're<00:03:33.330> dealing<00:03:33.540> with<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.670> you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
level that you're dealing with and you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.250 
level that you're dealing with and you
know<00:03:35.790> they're<00:03:36.060> running<00:03:36.390> at<00:03:36.540> max<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> guy

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
know they're running at max with a guy

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199 
know they're running at max with a guy
running<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.010> max<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.760> consoles

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
running a max because of the consoles

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.580 
running a max because of the consoles
obviously<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.600> PC<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.080> very<00:03:40.260> very<00:03:40.440> different

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
obviously on PC it's very very different

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.500 
obviously on PC it's very very different
they<00:03:40.770> could<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> lot<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.430> more<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:41.850> they

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
they could do a lot a lot more but they

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.570 
they could do a lot a lot more but they
can't<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.020> lot<00:03:43.230> lot<00:03:43.380> more<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.650> PC<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.340> then

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
can't do a lot lot more on PC and then
