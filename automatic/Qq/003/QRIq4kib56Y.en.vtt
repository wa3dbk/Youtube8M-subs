gives<00:00:35.470> it<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.680> much<00:00:35.949> more<00:00:36.300> aerodynamic<00:00:37.300> shape

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
gives it a much more aerodynamic shape

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.320 
gives it a much more aerodynamic shape
to<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.500> also<00:00:38.680> uh<00:00:38.830> this<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.640> now<00:00:39.820> show<00:00:40.120> YZ
