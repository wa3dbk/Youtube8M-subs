00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.850
 have to make you a certain place 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.560
 located north west of the map so at 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.330
 where the blue arrow flash 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.430
 so here I think made of master stars 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.040
 robert see so the blue arrow is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050
 where I once was this place you 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 are going to have two jet-ski take you 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.730
 one to get to where jamie 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.439
 the purple marker on the matte so 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.229
 makes a small tail rotor to see where 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.790
 them if you have not seen so as I 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.560
 wanted to say you did what is 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 get to the level of the violated marker 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 once arrived at the level of the marker 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.630
 joly you just dived and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.170
 locate where this airplane tail is 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.360
 so marked here without big ones you have 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.760
 said to spot her I'm going to show 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.860
 120 map exactly so here's the arrow 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.300
 blue it's me that's exactly where he 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.560
 is this object this plane tail I 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.590
 give back to stains for you can 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.100

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.260
 in this location 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.910
 once you have spotted it you 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.100
 you will have to recover three objects 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.250
 around that plane tail around 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.800
 so there is the rpg there is no longer any need 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 to present I think my opinion all the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.250
 world knows him 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.060
 then there is a machine gun 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.710
 not bad not bad 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.050
 the objects are highlighted a pure 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.510
 so see them so this 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.720
 submachine gun without the accessories well 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.720
 sure 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.930
 and the third object that is found 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.470
 just in front of his suitcases with 12000 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.470
 dollars in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.060
 always highlighted 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.060
 easily readable 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.420

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.820
