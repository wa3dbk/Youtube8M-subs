00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:16.190
 the history of eagle renewal 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.710
 eagle renewal is one of the 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.590
 well-known and that can touch the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.630
 being human by the resistance of changes 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.630
 during the life cycle 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.930
 do not be afraid of life is a gift of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.780
 God 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.800
 the eagle is the one with the greatest 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.870
 longevity of the species lives about 70 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 years 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.050
 however to reach that age 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.090
 at age 40 she needs to take a series 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 difficult decision 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 at 40 years of age your nails are 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.120
 met and flexible can not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.920
 grab the prey from which it feeds 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.590
 The elongated, pointed beak bends 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:13.760
 become heavy as a function of the thickness 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.880
 of their feathers by the time they passed 40 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.900
 years of the day the young woman was 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 the flight for the first time today to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.909
 experienced flying eagle is already very difficult 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.580
 in this situation there are only two alternatives 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 leave if you die or face a 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.820
 painful process of renewal that will 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.540
 last 150 days 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.810
 this process is to fly to the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.950
 high up of a mountain and there recoil and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 Juninho that is next to a wall 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 with a safe place for other predators 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.299
 and from where to return it needs 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 give a firm and full flight 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:09.319
 to find this place the water starts to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.560
 tap your beak against the wall until 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.189
 get it off 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.250
 bravely facing the pain and that 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.040
 this attitude entails 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.280
 patiently waiting to be born of a new 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.090
 beak with which you will face your old 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.410
 nails with the new lines 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.880
 she stares at the old feathers after 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 five months is reborn leaves for the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.880
 famous goal of renewal 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.050
 certainty of victory and being prepared 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.790
 to live 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 then for another 30 years 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.010
 many times in our lives 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.070
 we have to stop and reflect for some 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.710
 time and initiate a process of 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.980
 renovation 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.340
 we must get rid of prejudices 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.130
 of bad habits and everything that does not 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.720
 is more useful or important for 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.270
 we continue to fly on a victory flight 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.340
 only when they are free of the barriers of 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.460
 weight of the past 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.860
 we can take advantage of the valuable result 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:30.860
 that a renewal always has debuted 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.150
 beak of resentment tear the nails 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.860
 of fear 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:40.060
 remove the old feather from your wings 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:44.420
 allowing new thoughts to flow 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.110
 the eagle with its austere looking profile 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.040
 forward without losing sight of the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.390
 who is at your side always reach your 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.390
 goals and objectives 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:09.900
 but those who hope in the Lord have renewed 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.020
 the forces rose with wings like eagles 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:19.110
 they ran and did not get tired they walked 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:22.980
 They do not come isaiah chapter 40
