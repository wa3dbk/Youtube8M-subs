00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.180
 already 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.410
 hi friends 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.549
 is the third tutorial in which I'm going 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.010
 to teach your dog to make a turn in 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.450
 the ground 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:24.310
 she is rock salma the impatient that 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.950
 It is crazy to teach you to do what 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.750
 have to do then the following is 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.150
 always have on hand their is 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.950
 the prize they are going to give it to be something 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.890
 that you like as I said in several 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 tutorials already 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.390
 and that way they motivate the dog if the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.559
 sorry is not motivated well then 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 called my bed 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.600
 they motivate you 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.850
 and if they do that they have to do is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.500
 you have to see the first two 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.140
 tutorials I did 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.440
 so that the dog can resemble the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.320
 positions and thus be able to achieve that trick 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.630
 The first thing they have to do is 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.630
 call it is to tell the order sit down 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:24.140
 then they take the earth far away and 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.369
 and how the dog will not know how to turn 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.909
 between the cock and they make him with the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.490
 hand that way can be rotated 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.640
 wheels 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 as you want to give the order what 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.240
 important is that the bull understands it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 with rice 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 to the people of the earth earth and the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 supports and makes you turn 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.350
 and the prize when the dog turns 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.000
 then in this way the dog goes 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.710
 assimilating it and you do 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.820
 repetitions several times until the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.820
 dog already do it alone 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.379
 and then there 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.630
 what goes a lot the biggest influence is 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.510
 in you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.260
 do not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.860
 do not 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.860
 two 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.540
 Hello 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.409
 do not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.409
 family 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 sit down 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.160
 and with that hand the left hand the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.020
 support for her to take the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 earth way 3 remember always when 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.310
 you are learning this trick of turning in 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 the ground 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 what you are going to do is support 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.660
 give him the signal that follows the order and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.710
 make it rotate for example in this 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.420
 case of you feel is the earth them you 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.570
 they say broken the dog is going to turn from the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.120
 next way then that's it 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.310
 thank you very much already know if there is anything 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.370
 they did not understand or something they did not like 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.209
