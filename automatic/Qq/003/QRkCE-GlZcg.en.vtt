hey youtube today we're going to be

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey youtube today we're going to be
installing<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.580> mighty<00:00:06.540> mount<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:08.370> are

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
installing the mighty mount and we are

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.540 
installing the mighty mount and we are
going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.880> applying<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.599> backing<00:00:10.139> plate

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
going to be applying a backing plate

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.070 
going to be applying a backing plate
this<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> backing<00:00:12.269> plate<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.660> came<00:00:12.870> with

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
this is the backing plate that came with

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.340 
this is the backing plate that came with
the<00:00:13.170> mighty<00:00:13.410> mount<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:15.690> I'm<00:00:15.929> gonna<00:00:16.049> show<00:00:16.289> you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the mighty mount and I'm gonna show you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.670 
the mighty mount and I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.630> hard-to-reach

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
how you can do this in hard-to-reach

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
how you can do this in hard-to-reach
spaces<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.070> applying<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.970> backing<00:00:21.449> plate

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
spaces so applying a backing plate

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689 
spaces so applying a backing plate
inside<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.529> hull<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.740> sometimes<00:00:23.490> be

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
inside the hull can sometimes be

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
inside the hull can sometimes be
difficult<00:00:23.930> depending<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.199> where<00:00:25.350> you're

works first off you're gonna have to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
works first off you're gonna have to
choose<00:00:41.340> where<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.719> put<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> mighty

mount<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
mount this one is going to be for a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
mount this one is going to be for a
light<00:00:46.020> pole<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.930> possibly<00:00:48.930> maybe<00:00:49.710> I'd<00:00:50.100> want

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
light pole and possibly maybe I'd want

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
light pole and possibly maybe I'd want
to<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.300> strong<00:00:51.750> enough<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to have it you know strong enough for a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.090 
to have it you know strong enough for a
rod<00:00:53.370> holder<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.780> someone<00:00:55.680> sitting<00:00:55.949> on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
rod holder if I have someone sitting on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.130 
rod holder if I have someone sitting on
the<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.449> occasionally<00:00:58.079> done

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the back which I have occasionally done

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.029 
the back which I have occasionally done
on<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.890> pro<00:00:59.129> angler<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> 14<00:01:00.539> model

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
on this pro angler this is the 14 model

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
on this pro angler this is the 14 model
so<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:03.000> why<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.629> putting<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so that's why we're gonna be putting the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740 
so that's why we're gonna be putting the
backing<00:01:04.290> plate<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.180> really<00:01:06.180> secure<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
backing plate on just really secure it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
backing plate on just really secure it
well<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:08.220> gonna<00:01:08.310> choose<00:01:08.640> where<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.060> want

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
well so we're gonna choose where we want

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.830 
well so we're gonna choose where we want
and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.110> gonna<00:01:10.200> drill<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.580> hole

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
and then we're gonna drill out one hole

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
and then we're gonna drill out one hole
somehow<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.900> drilled<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> hole<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.610> we

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
somehow we drilled the hole and now we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.920 
somehow we drilled the hole and now we
will<00:01:15.890> put<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> bolt<00:01:17.310> through<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:18.150> secure<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
will put a bolt through just secure it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.830 
will put a bolt through just secure it
in<00:01:19.080> place<00:01:19.229> while<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.830> drill<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.340> holes

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
in place while we drill the other holes

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.480 
in place while we drill the other holes
and<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.170> helps<00:01:22.439> keep<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> aligned<00:01:23.130> for

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and that just helps keep it aligned for

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.289 
and that just helps keep it aligned for
you<00:01:24.439> okay<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.490> drilled<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you okay so now that we drilled all the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.100 
you okay so now that we drilled all the
holes<00:01:28.579> we<00:01:29.579> run<00:01:30.479> line<00:01:31.310> through<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> mighty

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
holes we run line through the mighty

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
holes we run line through the mighty
mount<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:36.860> okay<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.610> how

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
mount just like this okay so this is how

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.410 
mount just like this okay so this is how
you<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> backing<00:01:40.380> plate<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> inside

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you get the backing plate to the inside

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.280 
you get the backing plate to the inside
of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> Hall<00:01:43.049> where<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> can't<00:01:44.490> reach<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of the Hall where you can't reach so we

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.210 
of the Hall where you can't reach so we
have<00:01:46.890> some<00:01:47.310> monofilament<00:01:48.299> fishing<00:01:48.659> line<00:01:49.220> we

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
have some monofilament fishing line we

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
have some monofilament fishing line we
ran<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.579> through<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.909> hole<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.570> hole

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
ran it through this hole in this hole

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710 
ran it through this hole in this hole
not<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.770> over<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.220> hole<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.180> it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
not this all over this hole and it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.550 
not this all over this hole and it's
just<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.049> piece<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> line<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.570> goes

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
just one piece of line and then it goes

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.429 
just one piece of line and then it goes
down<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.979> hall<00:01:59.240> we<00:02:00.240> grab<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
down the hall we grab it from out of the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
down the hall we grab it from out of the
hall

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
hall

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.770 
hall
and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:04.700> right<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> monofilament

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and then right here is the monofilament

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.300 
and then right here is the monofilament
and<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.899> simply<00:02:10.259> tied<00:02:10.709> some<00:02:11.009> nuts

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and then we just simply tied some nuts

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.750 
and then we just simply tied some nuts
here<00:02:12.410> let's<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.500> prevent<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> line<00:02:14.519> from

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
here let's just prevent the line from

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.839 
here let's just prevent the line from
coming<00:02:15.090> through<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.670> what<00:02:17.670> basically

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
coming through but what basically

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.600 
coming through but what basically
happens<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.379> pull<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.769> loop<00:02:20.129> here

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
happens is when we pull on the loop here

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.210 
happens is when we pull on the loop here
it's<00:02:21.480> gonna<00:02:21.660> pull<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.230> inside<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.010> hatch

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
it's gonna pull this inside the hatch

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.809 
it's gonna pull this inside the hatch
and<00:02:23.610> line<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.239> up<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.840> us<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.640> have

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and line it up for us and then we have

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.729 
and line it up for us and then we have
to<00:02:27.230> simply<00:02:30.379> put<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.560> our<00:02:31.739> first<00:02:32.360> two<00:02:33.360> bolts<00:02:33.870> so

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
to simply put in our first two bolts so

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.220 
to simply put in our first two bolts so
these<00:02:34.980> bolts<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:36.360> gonna<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
here those will just fall into the hatch

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.400 
here those will just fall into the hatch
and<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.579> retrieve<00:02:56.879> them<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.170> that's<00:03:01.170> what

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
here I'll show you how it works so we're

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.190 
here I'll show you how it works so we're
gonna<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.030> set<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.660> Hat<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.780> then

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
gonna just set this in the Hat and then

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.660 
gonna just set this in the Hat and then
we're<00:03:10.410> gonna<00:03:10.500> go<00:03:10.799> over<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.160> here

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
we're gonna go over to here

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.990 
we're gonna go over to here
we<00:03:12.420> had<00:03:12.540> already<00:03:12.750> drilled<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> holes<00:03:14.000> and

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
we had already drilled the holes and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.289 
we had already drilled the holes and
that's<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.660> way<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> looks<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.519> grab<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> line

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.500 

so<00:03:21.299> once<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.840> pull<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.790> backing<00:03:24.030> plate

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
so once you pull the backing plate

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.500 
so once you pull the backing plate
through<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.200> hole<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:29.280> keep<00:03:29.549> some<00:03:30.299> tension

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
through the hole just keep some tension

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.259 
through the hole just keep some tension
on<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.079> lines<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.169> we<00:03:34.530> have<00:03:34.769> our

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
on the lines so now that we have our

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.909 
on the lines so now that we have our
backing<00:03:36.269> plate<00:03:36.480> lined<00:03:36.810> up<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.410> take<00:03:37.440> some

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
backing plate lined up we can take some

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.680 
backing plate lined up we can take some
type<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.160> sealant<00:03:38.849> I'm<00:03:39.060> just<00:03:39.299> gonna<00:03:39.419> use

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
type of sealant I'm just gonna use

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.379 
type of sealant I'm just gonna use
marine<00:03:40.109> goop<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.220> use<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.790> number<00:03:42.359> of

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
marine goop you can use a number of

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.349 
marine goop you can use a number of
different<00:03:42.510> things<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:44.340> we're<00:03:44.910> gonna<00:03:45.030> coat

the<00:03:45.599> inside<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.049> these<00:03:46.319> holes<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:47.549> sealant

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the inside of these holes with sealant

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.920 
the inside of these holes with sealant
just<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.019> help<00:03:49.230> prevent<00:03:49.650> any<00:03:49.889> leaking

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
just to help prevent any leaking

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.400 
just to help prevent any leaking
okay<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.200> sealant<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.859> put<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.180> holes<00:03:54.410> we

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
okay the sealant is put on the holes we

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.979 
okay the sealant is put on the holes we
put<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> generous<00:03:56.040> amount<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.700> there<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.180> now

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
put a generous amount on there and now

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.650 
put a generous amount on there and now
we<00:03:58.380> are<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:59.010> pull<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.150> these<00:04:00.359> lines

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
we are going to pull on these lines

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.170 
we are going to pull on these lines
again<00:04:01.049> make<00:04:01.739> sure<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.220> our<00:04:02.430> holes<00:04:02.760> are<00:04:02.970> lined

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
again make sure that our holes are lined

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:29.110 
again make sure that our holes are lined
up<00:04:03.419> properly<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:05.690> run<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> bolts<00:04:07.049> through

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.760 

starting<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.180> snag<00:04:30.450> up<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:30.900> we're<00:04:31.710> gonna

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
starting to snag up there we're gonna

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.150 
starting to snag up there we're gonna
finish<00:04:32.370> these<00:04:32.700> off<00:04:32.940> by<00:04:33.450> hand<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.170> snug<00:04:35.040> them

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
finish these off by hand and snug them

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.120 
finish these off by hand and snug them
up<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.670> we<00:04:35.850> can<00:04:36.030> cut<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.420> line<00:04:37.070> okay<00:04:38.070> so

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
up and then we can cut the line okay so

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.920 
up and then we can cut the line okay so
now<00:04:38.790> our<00:04:39.630> two<00:04:40.190> bolts<00:04:41.190> are<00:04:41.430> in<00:04:41.460> place<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.720> they

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
now our two bolts are in place and they

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.980 
now our two bolts are in place and they
are<00:04:43.080> holding<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.770> backing<00:04:44.190> plate<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:45.419> line

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
are holding the backing plate in line

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.560 
are holding the backing plate in line
with<00:04:46.620> where<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.919> needs<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:48.120> now<00:04:48.270> we<00:04:48.330> can

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
with where it needs to be so now we can

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.200 
with where it needs to be so now we can
put<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.870> these<00:04:49.080> bolts<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.850> order<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.120> do

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
put in these bolts and so in order to do

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.400 
put in these bolts and so in order to do
that<00:04:51.330> we'll<00:04:51.480> cut<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> line<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:57.200> poke<00:04:58.200> that

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
that we'll cut the line and poke that

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.780 
that we'll cut the line and poke that
just<00:04:58.710> through<00:04:59.040> set<00:04:59.430> our<00:05:00.169> nuts<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:02.430> were<00:05:02.640> on

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
just through set our nuts that were on

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.940 
just through set our nuts that were on
the<00:05:02.910> backside<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:05.930> our<00:05:06.930> anchor<00:05:07.290> points<00:05:07.710> just

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
the backside and our anchor points just

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.510 
the backside and our anchor points just
fall<00:05:08.160> through<00:05:12.440> okay<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.220> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
fall through okay so here is the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.590
