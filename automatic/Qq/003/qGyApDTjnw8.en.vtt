00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
fidgeting around with this case you'll

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.800 
fidgeting around with this case you'll
eventually<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:59.190> able<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
eventually be able to get it in it is a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.630 
eventually be able to get it in it is a
very<00:03:01.110> tight<00:03:01.470> fit<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.069> into<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.370> case

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
very tight fit to get it into this case

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.940 
very tight fit to get it into this case
as<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.510> made<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> size<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
as it is made just to the size of the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.949 
as it is made just to the size of the
ipad<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.970> really<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> work<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.870> get

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
ipad so you really have to work to get

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390 
ipad so you really have to work to get
it<00:03:07.110> into<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> case<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.069> edges

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
it into the case because all the edges

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.040 
it into the case because all the edges
don't<00:03:08.640> really<00:03:08.850> want<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> let<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.569> iPad<00:03:09.900> in

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
don't really want to let the iPad in

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.479 
don't really want to let the iPad in
because<00:03:10.590> once<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.890> iPads<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.280> there<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
because once the iPads in there it

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.280 
because once the iPads in there it
doesn't<00:03:11.640> want<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.880> let<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.030> out<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:12.989> very

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
doesn't want to let it out so it is very

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.900 
doesn't want to let it out so it is very
very<00:03:13.380> form-fitting<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:14.280> very<00:03:14.430> difficult<00:03:14.640> to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
very form-fitting it's very difficult to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.000 
very form-fitting it's very difficult to
get<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.390> out<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.569> this<00:03:15.690> case<00:03:16.010> eventually

you<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.519> probably<00:03:17.819> most<00:03:18.209> likely<00:03:18.300> get<00:03:19.110> used

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you will probably most likely get used

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
to it it does take some time it just

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.309 
to it it does take some time it just
took<00:03:21.120> me<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.300> little<00:03:21.330> while<00:03:21.569> helps<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.989> get<00:03:22.170> it

around<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.049> edge<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.350> guys<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> see<00:03:52.799> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
around the edge are you guys can see the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.890 
around the edge are you guys can see the
black<00:03:53.130> silicone<00:03:53.549> covers<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.030> at<00:03:54.209> all<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.780> edge

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
black silicone covers up at all the edge

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.259 
black silicone covers up at all the edge
there<00:03:55.620> may<00:03:55.769> be<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:56.070> part<00:03:56.370> somewhere

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
there may be a little part somewhere

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.849 
there may be a little part somewhere
where<00:03:57.390> Peaks<00:03:57.750> right<00:03:58.230> there<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.470> guys<00:03:58.590> see<00:03:58.739> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
where Peaks right there you guys see the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.410 
where Peaks right there you guys see the
bezel<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.280> peeking<00:03:59.609> just<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.880> little<00:04:00.180> bit<00:04:00.269> right

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
bezel is peeking just a little bit right

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.509 
bezel is peeking just a little bit right
there<00:04:00.450> but<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.680> could<00:04:01.829> probably<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:02.340> that

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
there but you could probably just that

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.160 
there but you could probably just that
to<00:04:02.670> get<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.910> out<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.209> way<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.900> Pete

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
to get it out of the way but it is Pete

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.420 
to get it out of the way but it is Pete
me<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.350> little<00:04:04.440> bit<00:04:04.560> right<00:04:04.709> there<00:04:04.739> but

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
me a little bit right there but

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.530
