marketing<00:04:16.799> up<00:04:17.010> at<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.400> top<00:04:17.870> which<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.080> really

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
marketing up at the top which is really

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.070 
marketing up at the top which is really
just<00:04:20.310> about<00:04:20.459> what<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:21.030> saw<00:04:21.209> on<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.690> front<00:04:21.930> of

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
just about what we saw on the front of

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.550 
just about what we saw on the front of
the<00:04:22.560> box<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.090> flip<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.510> over<00:04:24.720> you

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the box and then if I flip it over you

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
the box and then if I flip it over you
can<00:04:25.770> see<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.340> actual

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
can see the actual

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.469 
can see the actual
stand<00:04:27.690> as<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.169> mentioned<00:04:28.500> before<00:04:29.000> which<00:04:30.000> does

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
stand as I mentioned before which does

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.520 
stand as I mentioned before which does
just<00:04:30.860> pop<00:04:31.860> out<00:04:32.069> like<00:04:32.129> that<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:33.349> then<00:04:34.349> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
just pop out like that and then the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.550 
just pop out like that and then the
pivot<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.759> actually<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.539> course<00:04:36.810> allow<00:04:37.500> you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
pivot can actually of course allow you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.589 
pivot can actually of course allow you
to<00:04:37.830> stand<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.190> up<00:04:38.310> picture<00:04:38.940> frame<00:04:39.180> style<00:04:39.479> I

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
to stand it up picture frame style I

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.640 
to stand it up picture frame style I
mean<00:04:39.629> that's<00:04:39.870> really<00:04:40.080> what<00:04:40.199> this<00:04:40.440> lends

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
mean that's really what this lends

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.149 
mean that's really what this lends
itself<00:04:40.949> from<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:42.210> picture<00:04:42.900> frame<00:04:43.199> design

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
itself from is the picture frame design

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.980 
itself from is the picture frame design
you<00:04:44.759> know<00:04:44.879> digital<00:04:45.210> picture<00:04:45.479> frames<00:04:45.720> where

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
you know digital picture frames where

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.070 
you know digital picture frames where
you<00:04:46.650> can<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:47.039> using<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.909> stand<00:04:48.180> move<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:48.990> in

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
you can just using the stand move it in

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.469 
you can just using the stand move it in
two<00:04:49.199> different<00:04:49.620> formats<00:04:50.520> or<00:04:50.759> orientations

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
two different formats or orientations

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.279 
two different formats or orientations
your<00:04:52.259> micro<00:04:52.949> USB<00:04:53.430> port<00:04:53.460> or<00:04:53.970> mini<00:04:54.539> USB<00:04:54.720> again

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
your micro USB port or mini USB again

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.070 
your micro USB port or mini USB again
correct<00:04:56.190> myself<00:04:56.669> as<00:04:56.879> I<00:04:56.970> didn't<00:04:57.330> notice<00:04:57.659> I<00:04:57.870> did

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
correct myself as I didn't notice I did

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.020 
correct myself as I didn't notice I did
notice<00:04:58.289> that<00:04:58.409> it<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.650> not<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:58.979> micro<00:04:59.550> but<00:04:59.729> mini

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
notice that it is not a micro but mini

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.249 
notice that it is not a micro but mini
USB<00:05:00.500> 2<00:05:01.500> full<00:05:01.710> size<00:05:01.949> USB<00:05:02.310> cable<00:05:03.180> included<00:05:03.330> so

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
USB 2 full size USB cable included so

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.379 
USB 2 full size USB cable included so
that's<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> port<00:05:04.830> right<00:05:05.039> there<00:05:05.069> I<00:05:05.520> don't

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
that's the port right there I don't

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's the port right there I don't
think<00:05:06.569> there<00:05:06.719> I<00:05:06.750> think<00:05:06.930> that's<00:05:07.080> just<00:05:07.289> to

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
think there I think that's just to

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.899 
think there I think that's just to
indicate<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.009> actual<00:05:08.340> port<00:05:08.580> nothing

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
indicate the actual port nothing

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.490 
indicate the actual port nothing
actually<00:05:09.330> there<00:05:09.509> beyond<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.020> unless<00:05:10.289> I'm

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
actually there beyond it unless I'm

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.430 
actually there beyond it unless I'm
incorrect<00:05:10.919> no<00:05:11.430> yeah<00:05:11.699> that<00:05:11.879> is<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.509> and<00:05:12.750> then

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
incorrect no yeah that is it and then

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.320 
incorrect no yeah that is it and then
serial<00:05:14.310> number<00:05:14.520> information<00:05:14.759> right<00:05:15.300> there

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
serial number information right there

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.390 
serial number information right there
and<00:05:16.169> that's<00:05:16.349> pretty<00:05:16.500> much<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.919> little<00:05:17.219> bit

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and that's pretty much it a little bit

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.240 
and that's pretty much it a little bit
of<00:05:17.490> AOC<00:05:17.759> branding<00:05:18.569> and<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:20.009> I

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
of AOC branding and there you have it I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.760 
of AOC branding and there you have it I
mean<00:05:20.430> that's<00:05:20.669> what<00:05:21.060> this<00:05:21.270> looks<00:05:21.599> like<00:05:21.770> very

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
mean that's what this looks like very

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.800 
mean that's what this looks like very
light<00:05:23.129> and<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.849> think<00:05:24.090> that's<00:05:24.270> really<00:05:24.509> what

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
light and I think that's really what

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.050 
light and I think that's really what
they're<00:05:24.930> going<00:05:25.199> for<00:05:25.349> this<00:05:26.129> is<00:05:26.310> all<00:05:26.460> about<00:05:26.789> if

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
they're going for this is all about if

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.540 
they're going for this is all about if
you<00:05:27.120> need<00:05:27.659> another<00:05:28.080> 16<00:05:28.620> inch<00:05:28.800> display<00:05:29.219> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
you need another 16 inch display you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.589 
you need another 16 inch display you
want<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.819> be<00:05:29.879> able<00:05:29.969> to<00:05:30.090> present<00:05:30.449> information

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
want to be able to present information

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.230 
want to be able to present information
to<00:05:31.080> clients<00:05:31.349> this<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.430> really<00:05:32.849> good<00:05:33.029> way<00:05:33.210> to

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
to clients this is a really good way to

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.839 
to clients this is a really good way to
do<00:05:33.569> it<00:05:33.719> other<00:05:34.110> than<00:05:34.409> having<00:05:34.650> another<00:05:35.219> device

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
do it other than having another device

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.120 
do it other than having another device
certainly<00:05:36.419> a<00:05:36.599> lot<00:05:37.050> less<00:05:37.080> expensive<00:05:38.009> than

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
certainly a lot less expensive than

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.240 
certainly a lot less expensive than
having<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.729> tablet<00:05:39.389> for<00:05:39.840> presentations<00:05:40.650> you

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
having a tablet for presentations you

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.950 
having a tablet for presentations you
know<00:05:41.370> any<00:05:41.610> other<00:05:41.849> device<00:05:42.360> pretty<00:05:42.630> much<00:05:42.810> is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
know any other device pretty much is

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.959 
know any other device pretty much is
going<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.229> cost<00:05:43.289> more<00:05:43.770> than<00:05:44.279> this<00:05:44.520> 16<00:05:44.940> inch

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
going to cost more than this 16 inch

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.540 
going to cost more than this 16 inch
display<00:05:45.539> as<00:05:45.719> far<00:05:45.960> as<00:05:46.110> what<00:05:46.889> quality<00:05:47.370> will<00:05:47.520> be

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
display as far as what quality will be

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.580 
display as far as what quality will be
like<00:05:47.819> I<00:05:47.940> can't<00:05:48.210> speak<00:05:48.479> to<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:48.659> yet<00:05:49.080> need<00:05:49.440> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
like I can't speak to that yet need to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.920 
like I can't speak to that yet need to
actually<00:05:50.069> use<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.759> first<00:05:51.270> but<00:05:51.509> at<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.750> price

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
actually use it first but at the price

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.570 
actually use it first but at the price
point<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.560> can<00:05:52.919> tell<00:05:53.069> you<00:05:53.219> it's<00:05:53.370> gonna<00:05:53.490> be

point I can tell you it's gonna be

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.269 
point I can tell you it's gonna be
relatively<00:05:54.330> difficult<00:05:54.569> to<00:05:55.500> be<00:05:55.680> let<00:05:56.009> me<00:05:56.099> see

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
relatively difficult to be let me see

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.550 
relatively difficult to be let me see
what<00:05:56.849> else<00:05:57.000> if<00:05:57.300> anything<00:05:57.840> else<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.110> still<00:05:58.319> in

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
what else if anything else is still in

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.040 
what else if anything else is still in
the<00:05:58.710> box<00:06:01.789> because<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:03.210> know<00:06:03.270> there<00:06:03.569> are<00:06:03.690> some<00:06:03.900> of

the box because I know there are some of

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.430 
the box because I know there are some of
you<00:06:04.169> out<00:06:04.199> there<00:06:05.270> expect<00:06:06.270> more<00:06:06.569> from<00:06:06.779> unboxings

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
you out there expect more from unboxings

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.219 
you out there expect more from unboxings
than<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.740> actual<00:06:08.159> device<00:06:08.550> and<00:06:09.229> basically

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
than the actual device and basically

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.839 
than the actual device and basically
this<00:06:10.560> is<00:06:10.860> what's<00:06:11.250> left<00:06:11.370> we've<00:06:11.879> got<00:06:12.139> an<00:06:13.139> actual

just<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.759> orientation<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.279> the<00:06:20.789> range

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
just the orientation and the the range

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.649 
just the orientation and the the range
of<00:06:21.650> motion<00:06:22.650> for<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.279> display<00:06:23.849> itself<00:06:24.330> and

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
of motion for the display itself and

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.999 
of motion for the display itself and
then<00:06:25.529> an<00:06:25.800> installation<00:06:26.580> guide<00:06:27.080> but<00:06:28.080> this<00:06:28.770> is

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
then an installation guide but this is
