 I present to your attention the game steering wheel 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:17.830
 for computer 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:23.010
 dialogue givi 11 in the sport steering wheel here you are 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.990
 see how he will see on the box 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.500
 located don't pay attention to 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.600
 I just take off the carpet on the floor near 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.929
 the number here is here there are such 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 here are two plugs in front 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:52.199
 Others I mean this place 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.800
 written interface there are beadings 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.319
 programming buttons take and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.839
 positioning tactical switch and 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.259
 media position paddle switches 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.670
 speeds well i mean 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:11.140
 petals shifter 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.659
 vibration effect easy connection 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.729
 easy installation on there is nothing complicated 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.850
 no right is to write here 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.579
 located on the steering wheel and pedals means 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.810
 notice here the switches 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.649
 so round 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:32.439
 is surrounded like in a car and in itself 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.619
 the wheel itself, he is another here 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.619
 here 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.510
 here is our still such things 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 times and what we see here we see 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.980
 the bags are packed here 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.520
 the device means he himself steering here they 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.050
 pedals 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.880
 let's get here now for our 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.350
 role 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.080
 do not pay attention to these sounds 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:14.030
 i'm just a younger brother here for my 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.030
 role right now 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.430
 so here is a movie purchased at sea 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.650
 dns store 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.500
 Kamensk-Shakhty Rostov region 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 here's a steering wheel and how he talked about 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 the switch is switched 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.390
 completely different on the steering wheel means that here 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.370
 still stands union pads on the reservoir 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.120
 such a cube under the wheel you can see the petals 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:51.379
 then the buttons here are the indicator here 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.390
 so there have sensitivity 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:03:03.170
 so here then there is such 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 joystick so well let's all this mean 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.870
 so here we see what this all died 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:18.079
 between 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:25.299
 courageous go further means here dad 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:25.299
 give us the pedal already from here 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.600
 the pedals are pretty heavy even 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.630
 heavy 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.230
 such special ones such here 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.480
 rubberized types such records to 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.540
 suppose if there is 0 0 and I'm very semi 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.180
 play to make the rooney shine like this 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:57.150
 rather did not make such a cake which 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:59.980
 yourself behind the wheel under the pedal and and such 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.990
 means that here we see under the pedals 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.620
 under the cakes and cardboard glasses we them 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.620
 put out 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.200
 plug this owls over here over here god 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.770
 so these press 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.169
 so look these suckers can 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.169
 unscrew I just found out myself 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.040
 let's turn them on again 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.880
 here's a check here and not a mover 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:05:07.600
 the role has 270 degrees here steering 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:11.990
 jet petals rubberized 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:18.290
 here so let's postpone what we have 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:23.660
 even cardboard boxes you will immediately more 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:28.540
 judge for yourself should be to push and him 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:37.220
 lies here we are jacket bag and 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:40.670
 driver melancholy unclear what it did 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.590
 warranty card to read it anyway 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.900
 I will later in the depot and guide 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.750

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:05.800
 drivers 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:09.740
 Well, that means 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:14.600
 the wheel will say pretty good looked 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.400
 lot of browsing on the internet in kind here in 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.940
 the game he behaves normally the same way 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:26.000
 vibration standing feelings generally advise 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:34.900
