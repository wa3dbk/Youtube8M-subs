00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
contact you can click on the address and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.160 
contact you can click on the address and
it<00:02:02.640> goes<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:02.970> maps<00:02:03.240> application<00:02:03.480> and

example<00:03:09.620> then<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.550> can<00:03:10.670> go<00:03:10.790> out<00:03:10.820> into<00:03:11.150> this

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
example then you can go out into this

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.030 
example then you can go out into this
whole<00:03:11.420> universe<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.080> thousands<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> apps<00:03:12.860> out

and so you can create your own suite of

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.710 
and so you can create your own suite of
functionality<00:03:18.950> with<00:03:19.670> apps<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.510> been<00:03:20.690> a
