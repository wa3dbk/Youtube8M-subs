work honorable there were and one thing

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.300 
work honorable there were and one thing
that<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.020> thought<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.560> nice<00:00:16.770> little<00:00:16.980> twist

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
that I thought was a nice little twist

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.740 
that I thought was a nice little twist
was<00:00:18.029> they're<00:00:18.210> gonna<00:00:18.359> say<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> think

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
was they're gonna say what I think

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
was they're gonna say what I think
you're<00:00:18.990> gonna<00:00:19.080> say<00:00:19.289> probably<00:00:20.300> we<00:00:21.300> don't

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
you're gonna say probably we don't

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.730 
you're gonna say probably we don't
always<00:00:21.600> agree<00:00:21.779> believe<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
always agree believe it or not I

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.710 
always agree believe it or not I
actually<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> fan<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> fact<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.359> some

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually was a fan of the fact that some

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
actually was a fan of the fact that some
of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> bosses<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.500> fought<00:00:25.769> were<00:00:25.980> actually

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
of the bosses we fought were actually

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
of the bosses we fought were actually
just<00:00:26.490> regular<00:00:26.640> enemies<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:27.990> fought<00:00:28.230> at

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
just regular enemies that we fought at

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.529 
just regular enemies that we fought at
minish<00:00:28.890> size<00:00:29.130> throughout<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> dungeon<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
minish size throughout the dungeon so I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.849 
minish size throughout the dungeon so I
thought<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> nice<00:00:31.470> time<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.740> think

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
thought that was a nice time I think

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
thought that was a nice time I think
there<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.219> no<00:00:32.399> creativity<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.300> Nintendo

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
there was no creativity by Nintendo

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
there was no creativity by Nintendo
whatsoever<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.739> they're<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.160> oh<00:00:35.309> good

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
whatsoever and they're like oh good

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
whatsoever and they're like oh good
either<00:00:35.880> way

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
either way

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
either way
I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> will<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> something<00:00:37.200> new<00:00:37.530> like

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I think I will see something new like

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
I think I will see something new like

idea today but you know one thing we're
gonna<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.520> ranking<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.059> gonna

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
gonna do with this ranking you're gonna

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
gonna do with this ranking you're gonna
see<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.690> uh<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> final<00:00:49.649> boss

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
see that we uh we take the final boss
fight<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> split<00:00:50.789> into<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> three<00:00:51.480> different

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
fight and split into the three different

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840 
fight and split into the three different
phases<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.739> let's<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.070> honest<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.640> put

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
phases because let's be honest if we put

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.400 
phases because let's be honest if we put
them<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.059> together<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.780> final<00:00:55.110> boss<00:00:55.230> fight

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
them all together the final boss fight

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
them all together the final boss fight
is<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.649> win<00:00:55.860> hands<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:56.820> no

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
is gonna win hands down and that's no

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
is gonna win hands down and that's no
fun<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> three<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.109> separate

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
fun it really is three just separate

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
fun it really is three just separate
strategies<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.219> used<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> beat<00:01:00.090> each

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
strategies that you used to beat each

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
strategies that you used to beat each
boss<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.559> three

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
boss to so it really is like three

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
boss to so it really is like three
separate<00:01:02.370> fights<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.449> our<00:01:03.570> mesh<00:01:03.809> cat

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
separate fights but this is our mesh cat

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.130 
separate fights but this is our mesh cat
Bosch<00:01:04.500> ranking<00:01:04.979> let's<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> video

from just being so bland to start the
game<00:01:18.049> well<00:01:18.560> first<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.890> all<00:01:18.950> he<00:01:19.130> was<00:01:19.250> just<00:01:19.429> like

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
game well first of all he was just like

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.219 
game well first of all he was just like
a<00:01:19.579> regular<00:01:19.819> game<00:01:20.149> he<00:01:20.390> was<00:01:20.509> not<00:01:20.689> creative<00:01:21.140> at

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
a regular game he was not creative at

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.260 
a regular game he was not creative at
all<00:01:21.319> he<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.740> now<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.219> big<00:01:22.579> because<00:01:22.819> we're<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
all he just now so big because we're a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.789 
all he just now so big because we're a
Mitch<00:01:23.569> and<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.200> thought<00:01:24.319> that<00:01:24.469> was<00:01:24.590> kind<00:01:24.770> of

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
Mitch and I thought that was kind of

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.109 
Mitch and I thought that was kind of
like<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.979> little<00:01:25.130> bit<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.429> creative<00:01:25.700> touch

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
like a little bit of a creative touch

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.029 
like a little bit of a creative touch
but<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.719> doesn't<00:01:26.990> I'm<00:01:27.350> very<00:01:27.590> pretty<00:01:27.829> on<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
but it doesn't I'm very pretty on the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.100 
but it doesn't I'm very pretty on the
why<00:01:28.159> disagreeing<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:28.939> you<00:01:29.149> red<00:01:29.360> perfect

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
why disagreeing with you red perfect

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.749 
why disagreeing with you red perfect
well<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:30.649> I<00:01:30.709> do<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:31.159> though<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.640> way

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
well what I do like though is the way

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.699 
well what I do like though is the way
