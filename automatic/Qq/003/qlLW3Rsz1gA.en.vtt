00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.309
 Everyone Kon'nichiwaa 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.790
 Yamazaki seems outing representative 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.340
 It is a chord today for the guitarist introduction 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.640
 I would like to talk about this 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.440
 Our code is a guitar 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.010
 Especially it is rock 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.640
 It is how to hold the code often used in 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.380
 The Tteyuu the pressing way is to is very easy 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.879
 What 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 All When the Well Well I remember Tteyuu one position one of Chords 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:41.540
 It is no exaggeration to say that you can play the code of 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:48.110
 I think I want to remember this 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:51.680
 In the first place it is the first position to control this power cord 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.450
 This is very easy as it is written in this figure 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 We do not keep only two 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.300
 For example, this figure 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.590
 When was it is to say Well f 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.590
 1 fret of 6 strings 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.690
 It and 3 frets of 5 strings 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 We hold down these two and hear only these two 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.940
 In other words, the other matter is adult third place 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.990
 Even if you say 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.460
 Just remember 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.770
 You will need quite a lot of structure 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.570
 So whether is should you go with the actual specifically what the wind because the power code 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.850
 Though it is a story 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.920
 First red and blue 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.470
 I think that there is a place of this ahkah is Ford 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.690
 For example, if f is written 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:53.420
 Speaking of the woman of the file This is par code of f 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 I think it is written in my head, for example, No is the code that begins from etc. code Tteyuu the Sea 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.990
 If this red position is on the ground, which power code is the power code of Kamui? 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.909
 Become 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.500
 Hmm 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.440
 this is 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:14.250
 It is written in 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.500
 The 3 frets of 5 strings are dobons, so these two sounds are the par chords of c. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.980
 It has become 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.300
 Well then I learned this power cord shape 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 a 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:28.450
 Where do you wish the soil to be ? 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:37.180
 Because I think that I can not play it easily if I do not know the potion if there is a fruit 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:40.610
 It is 9 strings of 5 strings etc. It is a string of 9 strings. Where is the Doremi cool ? 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.090
 I think that I would like to confirm something first 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.240
 First of all it is if 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.910
 5 items 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.569
 Pamphlet 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.560
 And 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 There is also in the mouth 8 frets of 6 strings 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.090
 Although this is different from suppressing, it is the same to take out actually 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.760
 Ne 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.370
 5 frets 5 frets next 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 7 frets less than 35 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.200
 Oh of 5 8 fret and 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.390
 1 bed of 6 strings 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.990
 This is also different from suppression but it is the same to put out 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.410
 The next run of 5 frets and 6 strings of 3 frets 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.510
 a lover 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.100
 5 reduction of 12 fret and 6-string 5 fret 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.260
 Four 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.890
 A decrease of 6 7 fret last just be talking about the story 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.370
 How is the 8th fret of 6 strings 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.370
 In other words 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.510
 For example c 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.900
 a minor or f various codes 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.090
 I think everyone has seen it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.140
 f 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.940
 Emma g minor 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.540
 It is the wrote such code 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.300
 This part 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.890
 this part 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.720
 With this this 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.270
 If you hold it down according to the red place and play it, it will only be kept 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.390
 I'm wondering 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.470
 For example d 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.110
 How to suppress this 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.110
 First of all, p is the sound of the day 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.169
 As I saw earlier, 0 is the 5th fret of 5 strings 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.710
 It is here 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.710
 That is good 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.540
 and it was written eating d minor to be hand coming out here when you play in the power cord 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.830
 If it should match 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.830
 5 frets 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.240
 Five frets of five strings 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.830
 Starting from 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.920
 And you'll the other reached one of you and I will be on the other it just Oh Oh it 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.210
 It will be very easy 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:12.140
 Although this power cord is certainly easy though 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:16.000
 The frequency of use is quite frequent, for example 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.250
 It is like pulling all the policies holding down the proper back end 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.280
 It is how to hold down Even if person who knows it is power just because this power cord is good 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.190
 There are many situations where you use the code 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.800
 And 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:36.960
 Well Well, more than anything else in the very first in that you have that the Tteyuu this power code 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:42.630
 So it can be easy going through the song one song 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:45.480
 Then it is when the Do and this kind of sense of fun is playing in Tsu guitar comes out 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.070
 Progress page will also have become very fast 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:53.200
 To enjoy the guitar, I definitely have a power cord master c 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.130
 I think if you can enter 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.130
 Yes again
