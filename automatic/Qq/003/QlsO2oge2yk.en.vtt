Raceway<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> few<00:00:12.210> weeks<00:00:12.360> ago<00:00:12.509> while<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.200> was

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
Raceway just a few weeks ago while I was

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
Raceway just a few weeks ago while I was
up<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> had<00:00:14.009> saw<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.400> few<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.730> these

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
up there I had saw a few of these

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.550 
up there I had saw a few of these
syringes<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> blue<00:00:15.780> grease<00:00:16.020> floating<00:00:16.470> around

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
syringes of blue grease floating around

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
syringes of blue grease floating around
in<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> pits<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.390> didn't<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
in the pits and I really didn't think to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
in the pits and I really didn't think to
ask<00:00:19.170> exactly<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> had<00:00:21.180> never

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
ask exactly what it was but I had never

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120 
ask exactly what it was but I had never
seen<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> before<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.590> when<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.890> home

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
seen it before and then when I got home

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
seen it before and then when I got home
one<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> guys<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.029> Maine<00:00:24.240> actually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
one of the guys from a Maine actually

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.779 
one of the guys from a Maine actually
sent<00:00:24.990> me<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> message<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.529> said<00:00:25.680> hey<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
yeah of course mail it to me so of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
yeah of course mail it to me so of
course<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.530> make<00:00:34.710> promises<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.160> videos

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
course I don't make promises for videos

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920 
course I don't make promises for videos
but<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.940> tried<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> stuff<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
but I tried this stuff out and it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.180 
but I tried this stuff out and it
actually<00:00:37.230> works<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.590> well<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> basically

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
actually works really well and basically

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually works really well and basically
what<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> blue<00:00:39.200> oring<00:00:40.200> grease<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
what it is it's a blue oring grease this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.970 
what it is it's a blue oring grease this
designed<00:00:41.520> specifically<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.149> o-rings<00:00:42.719> now

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
designed specifically for o-rings now

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.600 
designed specifically for o-rings now
I'm<00:00:43.980> sure<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.219> doesn't<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> rocket

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I'm sure it doesn't take a rocket

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
I'm sure it doesn't take a rocket
scientist<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> tell<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> nobody<00:00:45.809> went

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
scientist to tell you that nobody went

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.950 
scientist to tell you that nobody went
out<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.789> chemist<00:00:48.360> develop

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
out and had a you know a chemist develop

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
out and had a you know a chemist develop
grease<00:00:49.230> specifically<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.160> o-ring<00:00:50.250> they

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
grease specifically for an o-ring they

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
grease specifically for an o-ring they
probably<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.030> found<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.539> bought<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
probably just found this bought it in

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
probably just found this bought it in
bulk<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> obviously<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.430> packaging<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
bulk and obviously are packaging it up

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
bulk and obviously are packaging it up
but<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> important<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
but the important part about that is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
but the important part about that is
that<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.760> stuff<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.210> works<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> I've

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that this stuff really works and I've

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.990 
that this stuff really works and I've
talked<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> more<00:00:59.039> than<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.520> few<00:00:59.760> different

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
talked to more than a few different

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
talked to more than a few different
people<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.289> grease<00:01:01.649> selection

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
people about you know grease selection

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
people about you know grease selection
for<00:01:02.219> o-rings<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> want

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
for o-rings because really what you want

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.760 
for o-rings because really what you want
your<00:01:04.530> grease<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.369> provide<00:01:06.090> lubrication

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
your grease to do is provide lubrication

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.719 
your grease to do is provide lubrication
between<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> shack<00:01:08.040> shaft<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> Orient

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
between the shack shaft and the Orient

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
between the shack shaft and the Orient
self<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.170> important<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
self but just as important as the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.230 
self but just as important as the
lubrication<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.850> grease<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
lubrication that that grease is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
lubrication that that grease is
providing<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> grease<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
providing you really want that grease to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
providing you really want that grease to
form<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> barrier<00:01:14.790> between<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.570> silicon

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
form a barrier between your silicon

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200 
form a barrier between your silicon
based<00:01:16.259> oring<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.280> silicon<00:01:17.670> fluid<00:01:18.030> that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
based oring and the silicon fluid that's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
based oring and the silicon fluid that's
actually<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> shock<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.619> what

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
actually in the shock because what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
actually in the shock because what
happens<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.670> were<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.810> people

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
happens is if you were to I see people

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
happens is if you were to I see people
all<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.380> post<00:01:22.979> pictures<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.490> they

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
all the time post pictures and they

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
all the time post pictures and they
actually<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.689> soak<00:01:24.990> their

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
actually will actually soak their

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
actually will actually soak their
o-rings<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> silicone<00:01:26.700> fluid<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
o-rings in silicone fluid which is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 
o-rings in silicone fluid which is
really<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> worst<00:01:28.290> possible<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.040> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
really the worst possible thing you can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.990 
really the worst possible thing you can
do<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.850> silicone<00:01:30.829> oil<00:01:31.829> will<00:01:32.490> cause

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
do because silicone oil will cause

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
do because silicone oil will cause
silicone<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.020> rings<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.439> swell<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
silicone or rings to swell so what you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
silicone or rings to swell so what you
really<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.540> grease<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
really want is some grease like this to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
really want is some grease like this to
create<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> barrier<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:39.750> o-rings<00:01:40.110> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
create a barrier for your o-rings so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.660 
create a barrier for your o-rings so
that<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.860> swell<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:41.490> last

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that they don't swell so that they last

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.719 
that they don't swell so that they last
a<00:01:41.880> lot<00:01:42.119> lot<00:01:42.360> longer<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a lot lot longer and so I got this a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.219 
a lot lot longer and so I got this a
couple<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> weeks<00:01:45.210> ago<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.079> actually

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
couple of weeks ago now and I actually

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
couple of weeks ago now and I actually
built<00:01:46.680> some<00:01:46.860> shocks<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:48.119> were

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
built some shocks with it there were

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
built some shocks with it there were
brand<00:01:48.450> new<00:01:48.570> ran<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.470> little<00:01:49.680> bit<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.979> was

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
brand new ran them a little bit and was

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
brand new ran them a little bit and was
actually<00:01:50.280> able<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.000> back<00:01:51.090> apart

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
actually able to take them back apart

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
actually able to take them back apart
and<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> obviously<00:01:52.710> there's<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:52.979> real

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and they and obviously there's no real

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.399 
and they and obviously there's no real
solid<00:01:53.670> measure<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.229> much

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
solid measure to find out how much

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.200 
solid measure to find out how much
diction<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> shack<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> tell

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
diction is in the shack but I can tell

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.249 
diction is in the shack but I can tell
you<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.390> after<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.630> couple<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> weeks<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you that after a couple of weeks of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
you that after a couple of weeks of
being<00:01:58.829> filled<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.280> shock<00:01:59.460> oil<00:01:59.670> being<00:02:00.270> ran

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
being filled with shock oil being ran

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.499 
being filled with shock oil being ran
they<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> took<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.360> apart

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
they they when I took them back apart

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
they they when I took them back apart
and<00:02:03.930> emptied<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> oil<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> shocks

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and emptied the oil out of the shocks

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.069 
and emptied the oil out of the shocks
they<00:02:05.549> definitely<00:02:05.820> felt<00:02:06.149> very<00:02:06.450> smooth<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
they definitely felt very smooth and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
they definitely felt very smooth and
just<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:08.099> very<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.489> friction<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.270> have

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just very very little friction so I have

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.639 
just very very little friction so I have
to<00:02:09.720> imagine<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.140> stuff<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.379> works

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to imagine this stuff actually works

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
to imagine this stuff actually works
pretty<00:02:10.739> good<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.520> other<00:02:11.670> thing<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
pretty good one other thing I like is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
pretty good one other thing I like is
that<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.720> go<00:02:12.870> over<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> means<00:02:13.410> well

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that if you go over to a means well

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.960 
that if you go over to a means well
so<00:02:13.769> they've<00:02:13.950> actually<00:02:14.129> put<00:02:14.459> all<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.190 
of temperature range and stuff like that
and<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:37.950> anyways<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.659> stuff<00:02:39.930> it's
