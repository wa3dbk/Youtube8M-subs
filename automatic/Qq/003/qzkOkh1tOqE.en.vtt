00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.270
 We always thought that aliens would come from outer space. 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.020
 We are all wrong 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.080
 They actually appear from the bottom of the sea 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.610
 Technically still from space, if you think everything is in space 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.870
 But this is not important! 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.650
 Anyway. 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750
 Big monsters appear from the bottom of the sea 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 And began to destroy everything in front of them. 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.510
 After that, the United Nations clearly saw a lot of cartoons. 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.110
 And decided the only way to fight monsters 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.270
 Is to build your own monster 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.710
 I said that when they detected the monster, they bombed them with a nuclear bomb. 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.180
 I recommend building a huge robot that is as big as a monster! 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.060
 Then we can watch them fight! 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
 Yeah! Really a good idea! Please implement this plan as soon as possible! 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.980
 Hey... nuclear bomb. 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.780
 We built huge robots and called them hunters. 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.570
 Now we are all famous and the last hope of the earth... 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700
 You know... I can keep talking about it. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.210
 But do you really think that the introduction of the 20-minute title is reasonable? 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.320
 Right? 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.050
 This introduction is too long! 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 Ok, the title is here. 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
 How to end the Pacific Rim 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.280
 We are almost out of oxygen! 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.830
 We will die! 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 We have no weapons! 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 We have this left! 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 For the family! 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 Wow! Tu Long Jian is really easy to use! 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 Why are we not using this first move? 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 Because the scene is too messy? 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 My guess... 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
 This still makes me think of a way 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 Good gypsy, we detected the dynamic, two monsters are moving towards you. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.970
 Analogy! 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.240
 Killed one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.370
 Analogy! 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.940
 The second is only solved! 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.750
 Wow! This is much simpler! 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 Clean the brigade, please give way! 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 Ladies and gentlemen, cleaning begins! 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 Ok! 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 Go ahead and watch the King Kong vacuum cleaner! 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 King Kong vacuum cleaner! 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 Be alert, the third signal appears from the crack! 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.370
 Attribute is... 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.470
 It is a fifth level monster! 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 Oh! Thank you holy warrior! 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 no problem! Everyone is doing well! 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.210
 Ok! 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.430
 Ah, itâ€™s much easier to fight here than to wait for them to come. 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
 But it doesn't look cool anymore. 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130
 whatever 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 Hello children 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.210
 I am going home! 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.710
 Where is the subscription key for my murder? 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050
 Oh, here. 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
 thanks for watching!
