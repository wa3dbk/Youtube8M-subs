00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
series so far because I'm having so much

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.480 
series so far because I'm having so much
fun<00:05:52.700> it's<00:05:53.390> such<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.750> challenge<00:05:54.169> because<00:05:54.620> FIFA

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
fun it's such a challenge because FIFA

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.840 
fun it's such a challenge because FIFA
15<00:05:55.669> is<00:05:56.180> so<00:05:56.690> different<00:05:57.350> in<00:05:57.530> my<00:05:57.650> opinion<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.610> is

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
15 is so different in my opinion it is

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.360 
15 is so different in my opinion it is
one<00:05:58.880> of<00:05:59.120> those<00:05:59.419> FIFA's<00:06:00.050> where<00:06:00.650> when<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.160> get

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
one of those FIFA's where when you get

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.460 
one of those FIFA's where when you get
it<00:06:01.550> you<00:06:01.910> really<00:06:02.330> have<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.750> adjust<00:06:03.140> to<00:06:03.440> it

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
it you really have to adjust to it

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.250 
it you really have to adjust to it
because<00:06:04.040> the<00:06:04.220> players<00:06:04.520> are<00:06:04.850> moving<00:06:05.360> a<00:06:05.750> lot

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
because the players are moving a lot

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
because the players are moving a lot
different

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
different

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.350 
different
the<00:06:07.490> defense<00:06:08.000> is<00:06:08.419> behaving<00:06:08.960> so<00:06:09.590> so<00:06:10.550> different

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
the defense is behaving so so different

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.780 
the defense is behaving so so different
it's<00:06:11.540> incredible<00:06:12.350> because<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.890> defense<00:06:13.370> in

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
it's incredible because the defense in

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.750 
it's incredible because the defense in
FIFA<00:06:14.270> 14<00:06:14.510> would<00:06:15.050> actually<00:06:15.620> get<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.919> boost<00:06:16.310> when

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
FIFA 14 would actually get a boost when

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.390 
FIFA 14 would actually get a boost when
a<00:06:16.970> striker<00:06:17.479> was<00:06:17.810> getting<00:06:18.169> past<00:06:18.440> them<00:06:18.740> but<00:06:19.280> in

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
a striker was getting past them but in

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.719 
a striker was getting past them but in
FIFA<00:06:19.790> 15<00:06:19.940> that<00:06:20.900> boost<00:06:21.440> is<00:06:21.770> gone<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.520> only

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
FIFA 15 that boost is gone the only

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.810 
FIFA 15 that boost is gone the only
thing<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.479> can<00:06:23.690> rely<00:06:23.870> on<00:06:24.050> is<00:06:24.650> that<00:06:25.280> the<00:06:25.550> player

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
thing you can rely on is that the player

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.120 
thing you can rely on is that the player
will<00:06:26.479> get<00:06:26.720> tired<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.560> player<00:06:27.800> that<00:06:27.979> is

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
will get tired the player that is

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.280 
will get tired the player that is
attacking<00:06:28.700> and<00:06:28.880> by<00:06:29.030> then<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.900> will<00:06:30.020> be<00:06:30.140> able

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
attacking and by then you will be able

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.159 
attacking and by then you will be able
to<00:06:30.470> catch<00:06:30.800> up<00:06:31.070> to<00:06:31.100> him<00:06:31.430> but<00:06:31.880> otherwise<00:06:32.390> you<00:06:33.140> are

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
to catch up to him but otherwise you are

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.260 
to catch up to him but otherwise you are
basically<00:06:33.979> fucked<00:06:34.370> and<00:06:34.640> this<00:06:34.910> really

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
basically fucked and this really

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.370 
basically fucked and this really
surprised<00:06:35.750> me<00:06:35.900> demonology

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
surprised me demonology

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.520 
surprised me demonology
still<00:06:37.620> did<00:06:38.040> not<00:06:38.250> improve<00:06:38.730> at<00:06:39.000> all<00:06:39.210> he's<00:06:39.480> at<00:06:39.750> 75

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
I might have to get him back into the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.830 
I might have to get him back into the
team<00:06:43.320> if<00:06:43.560> I<00:06:43.890> get<00:06:44.220> a<00:06:44.400> lot<00:06:44.700> more<00:06:44.730> injuries<00:06:45.540> to

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.410 
into this team I'm really thinking about

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.310 
into this team I'm really thinking about
some<00:07:40.950> big<00:07:41.250> big<00:07:41.490> transfers<00:07:42.170> considering<00:07:43.170> the

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
some big big transfers considering the

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.430 
some big big transfers considering the
defense<00:07:43.860> but<00:07:44.400> of<00:07:44.580> course<00:07:45.000> in<00:07:45.360> the<00:07:45.510> end<00:07:45.660> it<00:07:46.230> is

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
defense but of course in the end it is

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.860 
defense but of course in the end it is
going<00:07:46.740> to<00:07:46.980> be<00:07:47.160> the<00:07:47.370> assistant<00:07:48.030> coaches<00:07:48.300> who

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:48.870 
going to be the assistant coaches who

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.770 
going to be the assistant coaches who
decide<00:07:49.290> which<00:07:49.980> players<00:07:50.400> we<00:07:50.820> are<00:07:51.030> going<00:07:51.420> to<00:07:51.570> get
