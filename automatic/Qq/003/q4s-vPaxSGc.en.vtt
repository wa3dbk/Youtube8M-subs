had to change Seb lock mo the years
we're<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.620> gets<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.950> bit<00:03:54.069> worn<00:03:54.310> there<00:03:54.670> well

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
we're just gets a bit worn there well

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.259 
we're just gets a bit worn there well
the<00:03:55.360> switch<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.940> doesn't<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.030> the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
the switch just that doesn't this the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.759 
the switch just that doesn't this the
sensor<00:03:58.690> rather<00:03:58.900> doesn't<00:03:59.230> send<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.500> collect

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
sensor rather doesn't send the collect

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:12.020 
sensor rather doesn't send the collect
information<00:04:00.040> all<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.459> time

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.260 

so<00:04:12.510> abs<00:04:12.840> as<00:04:12.990> well<00:04:13.140> as<00:04:13.260> want<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.590> say<00:04:14.270> burning

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
so abs as well as want to say burning

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:30.439 
so abs as well as want to say burning

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.589 

nice<00:04:31.449> going<00:04:31.750> around<00:04:31.870> corners<00:04:33.509> Kicks<00:04:34.509> down

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
nice going around corners Kicks down

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.709 
nice going around corners Kicks down
nicely<00:04:34.960> off<00:04:35.259> it<00:04:35.379> goes<00:04:35.409> all<00:04:36.400> know<00:04:36.639> up<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.479> get

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719 
nicely off it goes all know up to get

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.320 
nicely off it goes all know up to get
the<00:04:37.780> car<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.849> oil<00:04:39.969> pressure<00:04:40.120> has<00:04:40.300> gone

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the car so the oil pressure has gone

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.029 
the car so the oil pressure has gone
back<00:04:40.569> up<00:04:40.599> to<00:04:40.930> three<00:04:41.349> bar<00:04:41.560> then<00:04:41.770> when<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.009> drops

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
back up to three bar then when it drops

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.520 
back up to three bar then when it drops
on<00:04:42.430> Linux<00:04:42.849> or<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.599> dodgy
