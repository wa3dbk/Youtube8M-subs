going to show you how to program a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.039 
going to show you how to program a
computer<00:00:05.299> there's<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> lot<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.600> ways<00:00:06.779> for

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
computer there's a lot of ways for

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.129 
computer there's a lot of ways for
beginners<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.220> break<00:00:08.460> into<00:00:08.700> programming<00:00:09.300> some

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
beginners to break into programming some

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
beginners to break into programming some
people<00:00:10.410> say<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.590> should<00:00:10.679> use<00:00:10.950> Java<00:00:11.400> other

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
people say you should use Java other

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.810 
people say you should use Java other
people<00:00:12.599> say<00:00:12.719> she's<00:00:12.929> use<00:00:13.110> C++<00:00:13.610> but<00:00:14.610> I'm<00:00:14.700> going

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
people say she's use C++ but I'm going

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
people say she's use C++ but I'm going
to<00:00:14.849> show<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> use<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> programming

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
to show you how to use a programming

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.310 
to show you how to use a programming
language<00:00:16.529> called<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.220> Python<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.869> think

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
language called a Python which I think

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
language called a Python which I think
is<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> easiest<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.130> beginners<00:00:20.580> who<00:00:20.939> are

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
is the easiest for beginners who are

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.660 
is the easiest for beginners who are
getting<00:00:21.300> started<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.160> Python

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
getting started to get going with Python

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.839 
getting started to get going with Python
if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:24.990> computer<00:00:25.849> basically

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
if you can see my computer basically

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
if you can see my computer basically
just<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.510> web<00:00:27.720> browser<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
just point your web browser to

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.400 
just point your web browser to
python.org<00:00:32.600> now<00:00:33.600> once<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:33.989> Python

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
python.org now once you have Python

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.940 
python.org now once you have Python
installed<00:00:35.070> let's<00:00:35.910> write<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> simple<00:00:36.540> program

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
installed let's write a simple program

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
installed let's write a simple program
by<00:00:37.950> clicking<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.460> your<00:00:38.579> Start<00:00:38.910> button<00:00:39.230> go<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
by clicking on your Start button go to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.360 
by clicking on your Start button go to
all<00:00:40.440> programs<00:00:41.600> let's<00:00:42.600> find<00:00:42.840> python<00:00:43.290> 2.6<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
all programs let's find python 2.6 and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.350 
all programs let's find python 2.6 and
just<00:00:45.210> run<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> python<00:00:46.350> command<00:00:46.710> line<00:00:47.210> now<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just run a python command line now this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410 
just run a python command line now this
pulls<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.250> simple<00:00:50.250> Python<00:00:50.640> interpreter

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
pulls up a simple Python interpreter

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
pulls up a simple Python interpreter
meaning<00:00:52.140> Python<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.920> interpreted

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
meaning Python is an interpreted

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
meaning Python is an interpreted
language<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.809> means<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
language and that means that it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
language and that means that it
basically<00:00:55.829> figures<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
basically figures out what it's going to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
basically figures out what it's going to
do<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> line<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> code

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
do as it's going over the line of code

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.580 
do as it's going over the line of code
as<00:00:59.390> opposed<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> compiled<00:01:01.320> language

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
as opposed to be a compiled language

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.250 
as opposed to be a compiled language
which<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> compiled<00:01:02.640> into<00:01:02.820> machine

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
which is compiled into machine

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.149 
which is compiled into machine
programming<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.559> executes<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
programming and just executes it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
programming and just executes it
natively<00:01:06.080> let's<00:01:07.080> type<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> simple<00:01:07.799> program

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
natively let's type in a simple program

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.850 
natively let's type in a simple program
here<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> show<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.290> easy<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
here I'm going to show you how easy it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
here I'm going to show you how easy it
is<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.280> program<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.790> Python<00:01:11.970> you'll<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is to program in Python you'll say for I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.450 
is to program in Python you'll say for I
in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.340> range<00:01:14.670> 0<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.570> 20<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.830> basically<00:01:17.189> says

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
in the range 0 to 20 this basically says

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
in the range 0 to 20 this basically says
create<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> variable<00:01:18.360> called<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.799> we're

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
create a variable called I and we're

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.460 
create a variable called I and we're
going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> loop<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:21.060> 0<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> 20<00:01:22.140> therefore

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to loop it from 0 to 20 therefore

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.980 
going to loop it from 0 to 20 therefore
I<00:01:22.710> will<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.220> 0<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.270> 1<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.750> 2<00:01:24.960> then

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
I will be 0 then I will be 1 then 2 then

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
I will be 0 then I will be 1 then 2 then
3<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:26.189> until<00:01:26.340> 20<00:01:26.990> type<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> colon<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> then

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
3 on up until 20 type of colon and then

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.600 
3 on up until 20 type of colon and then
you're<00:01:29.549> enter<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.840> let's<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> tab<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you're enter now let's do a tab here and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.350 
you're enter now let's do a tab here and
we're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> say<00:01:33.259> print<00:01:34.259> hello

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
we're going to say print hello

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
we're going to say print hello
exclamation<00:01:36.360> point<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.920> make<00:01:37.920> sure<00:01:38.070> that's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
exclamation point and make sure that's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
exclamation point and make sure that's
enclosed<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.290> quotation<00:01:40.290> marks<00:01:40.820> no<00:01:41.820> space<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
enclosed in quotation marks no space and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
enclosed in quotation marks no space and
say<00:01:43.079> plus<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.689> then<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.960> STR<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.159> string<00:01:47.670> we're

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
say plus and then a STR for string we're

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.160 
say plus and then a STR for string we're
going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> convert<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> string<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
going to convert I to a string and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.450 
going to convert I to a string and
that's<00:01:52.259> what<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> order<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that's what you have to do in order to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
that's what you have to do in order to
print<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.840> other<00:01:55.079> text<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
print it out with other text on the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.590 
print it out with other text on the
screen<00:01:56.360> another<00:01:57.360> plus<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.640> say<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> times

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
screen another plus and then say I times

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.639 
screen another plus and then say I times
20<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> equal<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.990> let's<00:02:03.990> close<00:02:04.259> our<00:02:04.439> quote

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
20 is equal to let's close our quote

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.609 
20 is equal to let's close our quote
another<00:02:05.310> plus<00:02:05.930> I'm<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> say<00:02:07.259> string

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
another plus I'm going to say string

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.699 
another plus I'm going to say string
again<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
again I

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.910 
again I
times<00:02:10.159> 20<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.000> asterisk<00:02:11.540> means

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
times 20 that asterisk means

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.860 
times 20 that asterisk means
multiplication<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:14.180> basically<00:02:14.480> we're<00:02:14.719> going

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
multiplication so basically we're going

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.259 
multiplication so basically we're going
to<00:02:14.930> print<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.290> text<00:02:15.829> hello<00:02:16.069> 20<00:02:16.670> times<00:02:16.909> and

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
to print out the text hello 20 times and

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.050 
to print out the text hello 20 times and
then<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.140> number<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.829> currently<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
then the number that I currently is and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
then the number that I currently is and
then<00:02:20.569> multiply<00:02:21.079> I<00:02:21.290> times<00:02:21.650> 20<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:22.189> print<00:02:22.579> out

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
then multiply I times 20 and print out

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.470 
then multiply I times 20 and print out
what<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.000> is

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
what that is

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.360 
what that is
I'm<00:02:23.930> going<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.140> put<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.319> little<00:02:24.469> space<00:02:24.769> bar<00:02:25.099> here

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
I'm going to put a little space bar here

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.490 
I'm going to put a little space bar here
after<00:02:25.700> my<00:02:25.879> hello<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.079> read<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.319> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
after my hello so we can read it a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.649 
after my hello so we can read it a
little<00:02:27.620> better<00:02:27.859> say<00:02:28.730> enter<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.269> say<00:02:29.480> enter

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
little better say enter and say enter

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.319 
little better say enter and say enter
again<00:02:30.019> now<00:02:30.859> I<00:02:30.889> as<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.489> can<00:02:31.639> see<00:02:31.819> has<00:02:32.060> looped

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
again now I as you can see has looped

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.589 
again now I as you can see has looped
from<00:02:32.569> 0<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.079> 20<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.769> it's<00:02:34.489> saying<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:35.329> didn't

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
from 0 to 20 and it's saying it didn't

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.720 
from 0 to 20 and it's saying it didn't
include<00:02:35.810> 20<00:02:36.319> that's<00:02:36.889> important<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.489> keep<00:02:37.579> in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
include 20 that's important to keep in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.339 
include 20 that's important to keep in
mind<00:02:38.469> see<00:02:39.469> I<00:02:39.500> times<00:02:39.950> 20<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.430> 0<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.599> 10<00:02:42.079> the

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
mind see I times 20 is 0 if I is 10 the
