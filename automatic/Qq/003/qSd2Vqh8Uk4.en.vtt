00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

take<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.480> look<00:00:00.659> at<00:00:00.719> an<00:00:00.810> image<00:00:00.930> like<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.650> try

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
take a look at an image like this we try

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.470 
take a look at an image like this we try
to<00:00:01.890> affect<00:00:02.280> it<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.550> something<00:00:02.820> like<00:00:03.000> curves

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
to affect it with something like curves

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.510 
to affect it with something like curves
so<00:00:03.780> I'm<00:00:03.870> gonna<00:00:03.990> add<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> curves<00:00:04.980> layer<00:00:05.190> right

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
so I'm gonna add a curves layer right

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.480 
so I'm gonna add a curves layer right
here<00:00:05.690> and<00:00:06.690> first<00:00:07.410> hit<00:00:07.560> Auto<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.280> lazy

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
here and first hit Auto because I'm lazy

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.339 
here and first hit Auto because I'm lazy
like<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.389> don't<00:00:09.690> even<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:09.900> where<00:00:10.139> Auto

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
like that I don't even know where Auto

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.839 
like that I don't even know where Auto
is<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:10.950> never<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.550> it

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
is because I never use it

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
is because I never use it
forget<00:00:12.240> Auto<00:00:12.389> we're<00:00:12.630> not<00:00:12.750> gonna<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.139> Auto<00:00:13.349> I'm

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
forget Auto we're not gonna use Auto I'm

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.740 
forget Auto we're not gonna use Auto I'm
gonna<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.370> hitting<00:00:14.639> white<00:00:14.849> I'm<00:00:15.269> gonna<00:00:15.599> go

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
gonna go for hitting white I'm gonna go

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.210 
gonna go for hitting white I'm gonna go
for<00:00:15.990> hitting<00:00:16.199> black<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> find<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
for hitting black just to find the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830 
for hitting black just to find the
blackest<00:00:17.699> areas<00:00:18.000> I'm<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.240> go<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.630> hitting

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
blackest areas I'm gonna go for hitting

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320 
blackest areas I'm gonna go for hitting
middle<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.400> already<00:00:20.640> tell<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.150> is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
middle you can already tell that this is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
middle you can already tell that this is
really<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:22.020> working<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.010> I'm<00:00:23.100> gonna

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
really not working at all so I'm gonna

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.839 
really not working at all so I'm gonna
escape<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.500> I'm<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.849> delete

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
escape out of that I'm going to delete

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
escape out of that I'm going to delete
this<00:00:26.910> layer<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.500> gonna<00:00:28.650> try<00:00:28.890> doing<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this layer and I'm gonna try doing it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
this layer and I'm gonna try doing it
again<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:29.939> try<00:00:30.179> putting<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.630> curves

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
again so let's try putting on curves

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.780 
again so let's try putting on curves
again<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.009> time<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.430> gonna<00:00:32.489> press

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
again and this time I'm not gonna press

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.220 
again and this time I'm not gonna press
white<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.780> messed<00:00:33.989> things

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
white because that really messed things

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
white because that really messed things
up<00:00:34.440> pretty<00:00:34.500> badly<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.880> gonna<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
up pretty badly I'm gonna put on a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.430 
up pretty badly I'm gonna put on a
little<00:00:36.510> bit<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> black<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.320> gonna

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
little bit of a black and we're gonna

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
little bit of a black and we're gonna
change<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> middle<00:00:38.129> tones<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.820> button

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
change the middle tones with this button

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780 
change the middle tones with this button
where's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.600> nice<00:00:39.870> solid<00:00:40.350> gray<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.520> should<00:00:41.670> be

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
where's a nice solid gray this should be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
where's a nice solid gray this should be
great<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> clearly<00:00:43.440> not

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
great all right this is clearly not

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
great all right this is clearly not
working<00:00:43.950> curves<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.879> destroying<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
working curves is just destroying the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
working curves is just destroying the
image<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.700> why<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
image right here now why is that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
image right here now why is that
happening<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:49.079> order<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.710> we're

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
happening in order to see that we're

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
happening in order to see that we're
gonna<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.309> curves<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> hit

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
gonna go into curves so if you hit

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.810 
gonna go into curves so if you hit
control<00:00:52.079> 3<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> red<00:00:53.430> Channel

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
control 3 you can see the red Channel

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.689 
control 3 you can see the red Channel
control<00:00:54.149> 4<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.039> green<00:00:56.039> Channel<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
control 4 for the green Channel and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
control 4 for the green Channel and
conform<00:00:57.090> control<00:00:57.570> 5<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> blue<00:00:58.320> channel

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
conform control 5 for the blue channel

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
conform control 5 for the blue channel
here's<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.250> problem<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.670> here<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.420> blue

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
here's our problem right here the blue

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
here's our problem right here the blue
channel<00:01:00.930> doesn't<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.530> any<00:01:01.859> information<00:01:02.129> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
channel doesn't have any information in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
channel doesn't have any information in
it<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> obviously<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:04.110> image<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> composed<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it and obviously an image is composed of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.440 
it and obviously an image is composed of
a<00:01:05.189> red<00:01:05.339> Channel<00:01:05.640> green<00:01:05.820> Channel<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.270> blue

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a red Channel green Channel and blue

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
a red Channel green Channel and blue
channel<00:01:06.869> blue<00:01:07.770> channel<00:01:08.130> shows<00:01:08.430> both<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
channel blue channel shows both the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
channel blue channel shows both the
yellow<00:01:09.090> values<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> blue<00:01:10.200> channels<00:01:10.590> cuz

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
yellow values and the blue channels cuz

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
yellow values and the blue channels cuz
the<00:01:10.830> opposite<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> blue<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.729> yellow<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the opposite of blue is yellow so in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
the opposite of blue is yellow so in
order<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.369> information<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
order to get more information from in

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
order to get more information from in
order<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.350> an<00:01:16.530> image<00:01:16.860> less<00:01:17.340> yellow<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
order to make an image less yellow we

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
order to make an image less yellow we
need<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.530> blue<00:01:19.950> however<00:01:20.610> when

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
need to make it more blue however when

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
need to make it more blue however when
the<00:01:21.030> blue<00:01:21.180> channel<00:01:21.540> looks<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.229> we're

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the blue channel looks like this we're

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.789 
the blue channel looks like this we're
out<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> luck<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.650> into

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
out of luck so what do we do we go into

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
out of luck so what do we do we go into
something<00:01:26.159> called<00:01:26.310> channel<00:01:26.759> mixers<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
something called channel mixers and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.510 
something called channel mixers and
that's<00:01:27.420> located<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.189> click<00:01:29.400> on

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that's located right here you click on

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.260 
that's located right here you click on
channel<00:01:29.909> mixers<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:32.159> pipe<00:01:32.520> into<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> blue

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
channel mixers and we pipe into the blue

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
channel mixers and we pipe into the blue
channel<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> information<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> other

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you a warning you won't want it to equal

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.030 
you a warning you won't want it to equal
a<00:01:57.060> hundred<00:01:57.270> percent<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.229> no<00:01:58.380> more<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:58.920> if

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a hundred percent and no more because if

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
a hundred percent and no more because if
it<00:01:59.159> goes<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.729> hundred<00:02:00.090> percent<00:02:00.240> you're

it goes over a hundred percent you're

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
it goes over a hundred percent you're
making<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> computer<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> guess<00:02:02.340> what

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
making the computer have to guess what

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
making the computer have to guess what
to<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> how<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> interpret<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to do and how to interpret the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.679 
to do and how to interpret the
information<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> happens<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
information and if that happens it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.080 
information and if that happens it
doesn't<00:02:07.079> look<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.789> got

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
doesn't look as good all right so we got

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.580 
doesn't look as good all right so we got
it<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.810> further<00:02:10.020> let's<00:02:10.349> look<00:02:10.500> at
