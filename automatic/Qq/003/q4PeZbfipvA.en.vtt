00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 part in the first place but it recovers 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 quickly when when the line is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 leans to the left side of the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.719
 competitor will begin to discount the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 different changes again xunta is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 has gone back to third place we 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 we see very even at this moment 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.410
 really here should be a very career 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 smart and keeping the accelerator 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 you can not give up a single 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 second in the curve you can not brake 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.189
 at the wrong time it is at the moment 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 which is to lengthen the braking what is more 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 can the curve to maintain the position 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.210
 if you are third at this time 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 viewers of the channel versus the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 only sports television channel 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 Colombian goes on inside 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 thousands already a little one like to say 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 as if they were of an instant pass 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 you now or lead that I go a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.579
 little more back but the three are 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 making a big difference 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.589
 the one who stayed, I think he hit the month 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.850
 number 334 but we will not confirm 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.369
 it follows true first the 714 ruiz first 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.759
 where we're going to see him attacked and now 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.770
 es gómez the number 334 which assumes in 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.770
 this moment delegate of the competition 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.439
 ruiz the second third enjoys and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.170
 practically practically left 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.580
 out of the dow then the one that stayed from 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.380
 any touch was going strong 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 in the first place and it's the three that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 it's worth at this moment for podium of the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.330
 category of the 115 centimeters in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.600
 experts is enough when there are already six 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 turns surely enough attacks to the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 final again surpassed changes to 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.140
 first position that will just leave 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 the mini has risen in 334 the pilot 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 334 to reign two thousand 714 again 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 take the tip and so we will be seeing 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 the clear clear energy note that here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.270
 nothing is defined is a change of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.119
 temporary partial leadership that are made 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 they are practically relieving themselves in that 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.310
 position more than you 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 I go now now is the number 334 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.459
 gómez this santandereano king of the number 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.370
 334 and now returned to the place pri 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.220
 ruiz with the celery that did not move away from 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.340
 the 714 as you say it perfectly 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.209
 let's get that permanent image in 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.069
 these sectors may will be crucial 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.260
 continue with this crusade to get away from 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.390
 first place something that stays 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 second and oscar sultan third and not 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.860
 die from this group and it's a group with 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 a difference already too long 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.829
 in the other batch of competition from 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.290
 fourth place back are a lot 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.090
 able to attack and think about the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
 Here we are going to look for your 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.989
 attacking with a condition one 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.230
 construction aggressive construction that 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.120
 is the characteristic in this pilot 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.650
 llanero that has taken at this moment in 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.760
 the tip of living again very 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.709
 even 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 currently change there is no relief 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.330
 relief to the relief indisputably 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.280
 we wrote of the two 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.860
 the meters accommodate the best 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.990
 can each one his machine becomes the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.750
 necessary inclination to have a 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.910
 better aerodynamics for the vehicle 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.260
 or the bike is very good to adhere to 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.300
 pavement if you can talk about 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.980
 grip on a track as hard as the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.750
 that we have at this moment but 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.820
 let me tell you that right now 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.310
 is in sixth place 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 this pilot parked with the number 307 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.070
 adolfo tapias in casanare that a 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.080
 poquitico above is the number 440 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.150
 sandro more beam of santander which 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
 means that it is fifth and what it is that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.340
 he was always in the first three 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.920
 places 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.310
 now with the number 688 this small 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.270
 spot in the fourth position 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.390
 it stays the same and alternating there is no 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.310
 a definite position there is no pilot 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.140
 what can we say is the favorite of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.300
 win this competition because in these 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.270
 three pilots anything can happen 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.670
 and see you in the straight pass the three 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.190
 very even going through the line of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.620
 timing all the same however 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.790
 they keep the tip with the number 7 14 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.040
 move the 135 bits away at 130 and so the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.459
 things is still good alejandro ruiz 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.989
 of the department of Antioquia number 314 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.239
 second result of the department of 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.280
 goal and third place for santander and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.280
 no king of gomez number 334 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.160
 they take the curvón 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.250
 they move to the left and they pile up 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.290
 on the bike the new turn is dismantled 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.390
 trying to maintain that stability in 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.070
 the bike to give me balance and give it a 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.050
 little weight to the bike so that it 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.940
 keep on the curve when taking it so 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.700
 closed but but with such a clue 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.630
 difficult carlos I estimate that it is so 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.880
 complicated force like the moon 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.190
 in love what they do in some 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.080
 opportunities is almost to put the 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.450
 head in his hands to try to 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.040
 better break the wind and that this one 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.950
 make much resistance against 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.210
 vehicle against the motorcycle so think 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.670
 in which they fit very well will be 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.230
 supremely complicated is going for the 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.900
 last round to be showing in this 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.340
 moment the flag that means they 're going 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.530
 for the last turn and here is going to be 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.630
 quarry indisputably takes the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.110
 initiative takes the initiative in this 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.630
 moment the number 334 we were talking 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.850
 from santander no longer king of gómez let's go 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.710
 to see if it can be maintained is still 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.780
 ruiz is at this moment is the world of 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.360
 design and third result of the department 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.569
 of the final goal of fotofinish we are going to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.270
 have surely 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.969
 to go through the line of everyone very 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.159
 partners will seek the solution of the 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.929
 motorcycle that I go forward to 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.029
 boost in the other two filters that 

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:44.949
 be back and they will go very even 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.689
 when they reach the line, it's the same 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.279
 louis of new leadership of the 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.020
 competition here there is nothing definite 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.879
 gentlemen being alive is a duel 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.979
 titanic the one that we are living in this 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.869
 moment in the final at the end of this 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.719
 category of which 115 centimeters 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.909
 experts who accommodated each other 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.800
 the initiative after leaving the 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.199
 main body can be and win or 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.719
 die for a little bit for background presents 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.629
 an instability to make euros the 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.149
 competitors I think the ruiz of the 714 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.939
 now I was forward ahead is the 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:17.949
 number 334 to this query also comes 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.080
 with the number 13 in the third position 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.479
 this pilot from back to front to 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.789
 make a difference and hinder a 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.259
 little by little forward 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.449
 forward it remains at this moment 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.849
 gómez gómez is first with that is 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.800
 first felt ruiz to win gómez goes 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.490
 to win we're going to see value back on the 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.530
 straight 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:43.590
 comes with my goods as it has as 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:46.599
 to finish we go here perfect no 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.500
 change your minus 714 and antioquia 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:53.520
 Carlos Besance 714 of Antioquia Second 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.900
 his third gómez el santander no longer 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.750
 impress mind you predicted my 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.610
 dear carlos by fotofinish we are going to 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.370
 define the first three places the 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.740
 electronic timing system like this 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.349
 indicates to us of jalisco nor numbers of 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.419
 314 first place second city 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.419
 third gomez and number 334
