in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> dlc<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.369> snow<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.700> mean<00:01:05.970> obviously

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
in this dlc is the snow i mean obviously

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.910 
in this dlc is the snow i mean obviously
the<00:01:06.390> contrast<00:01:06.900> between<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.320> snow<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.799> your

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the contrast between the snow in your

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
the contrast between the snow in your
reticle<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.610> aim<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.270> especially<00:01:10.260> feeling<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
reticle we aim and especially feeling a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800 
reticle we aim and especially feeling a
little<00:01:11.100> bird<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.580> can't<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.240> why<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
little bird you can't really see why you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
little bird you can't really see why you
shooting<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> white

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
shooting out because the the white

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
shooting out because the the white
background<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.990> too<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:16.680> have

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
background is just too much so they have

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
background is just too much so they have
to<00:01:17.009> work<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to work something out to get that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
to work something out to get that
working<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:18.990> bit<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
working a little bit more if you have a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
working a little bit more if you have a
little<00:01:20.070> red<00:01:20.310> dot<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.820> barely<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.540> if

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little red dot you barely can see if

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749 
little red dot you barely can see if
there's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> storm<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
there's a bit of storm going on you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
there's a bit of storm going on you
cannot<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.689> anything<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> comes

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
cannot really see anything when it comes

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.050 
cannot really see anything when it comes
down<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> using<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.479> jets<00:01:27.780> using<00:01:28.290> your

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
down to using your jets using your

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.520 
down to using your jets using your
helicopters<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.270> even<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.720> red<00:01:31.020> dots<00:01:31.290> are

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
helicopters or even your red dots are

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
helicopters or even your red dots are
pretty<00:01:31.740> useless<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.400> they'll<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> work

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
pretty useless so they'll have to work

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
pretty useless so they'll have to work
something<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> maps

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
something out about that as for the maps

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
something out about that as for the maps
I<00:01:35.310> mean<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.810> maps<00:01:37.650> that
