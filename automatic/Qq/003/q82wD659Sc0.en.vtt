00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
I've got a Kenmore wash machine as how

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.520 
I've got a Kenmore wash machine as how
to<00:00:10.830> pry

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
to pry

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.430 
to pry
but<00:00:13.340> it<00:00:13.490> was

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
but it was

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.830 
but it was
Tate<00:00:14.590> or<00:00:14.950> rinse<00:00:15.340> or<00:00:15.580> spanner<00:00:15.910> Edith<00:00:16.299> stuff

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
Tate or rinse or spanner Edith stuff

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.120 
Tate or rinse or spanner Edith stuff
like<00:00:17.050> that<00:00:17.230> so<00:00:17.380> basically<00:00:17.650> stop<00:00:17.890> with<00:00:18.039> the

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
like that so basically stop with the

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.630 
like that so basically stop with the
water<00:00:18.340> point<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:19.240> every<00:00:19.510> site<00:00:19.930> I'd<00:00:20.140> gone<00:00:20.350> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
water point and every site I'd gone to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.609 
water point and every site I'd gone to
Basie<00:00:21.640> said<00:00:22.000> it's<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.480> lid<00:00:22.779> switch<00:00:23.200> that<00:00:23.470> was

Basie said it's the lid switch that was

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.080 
Basie said it's the lid switch that was
defective<00:00:24.310> so<00:00:24.430> you'll<00:00:24.550> replace<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.970> lid

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
defective so you'll replace the lid

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.490 
defective so you'll replace the lid
switch<00:00:25.330> that<00:00:25.570> didn't<00:00:25.810> fix<00:00:25.930> it's<00:00:26.140> how<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.290> do

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
switch that didn't fix it's how to do

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.790 
switch that didn't fix it's how to do
some<00:00:26.680> further<00:00:26.830> investigation<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:28.259> so<00:00:29.259> this

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
some further investigation and so this

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.349 
some further investigation and so this
video<00:00:29.980> is<00:00:30.220> going<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.369> explain<00:00:30.430> what<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:31.029> found

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
and how I fixed it it might be a problem

Kenmore<00:00:38.410> 500<00:00:39.280> washing<00:00:39.910> machine<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.330> that's

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
Kenmore 500 washing machine and that's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.960 
Kenmore 500 washing machine and that's
how<00:00:40.540> you<00:00:40.600> take<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.400> top<00:00:42.400> panel<00:00:42.670> there's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
how you take the top panel there's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.610 
how you take the top panel there's
basically<00:00:43.300> some<00:00:43.449> clips<00:00:43.720> under<00:00:43.989> here<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:44.530> if

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
basically some clips under here so if

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.240 
basically some clips under here so if
you<00:00:44.710> have<00:00:44.800> something<00:00:45.040> real<00:00:45.370> thin<00:00:45.670> putty<00:00:46.030> knife

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you have something real thin putty knife

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
you have something real thin putty knife
go<00:00:48.250> there<00:00:48.579> compresses<00:00:49.270> it<00:00:49.450> do<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.020> other<00:00:50.230> side

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.100 

and<00:00:53.530> then<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.450> comes<00:00:55.450> right<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.719> so<00:00:56.050> all

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
and then it comes right out so all

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.850 
and then it comes right out so all
you're<00:00:56.230> trying<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.469> do<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.710> basically

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
you're trying to do is basically

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.459 
you're trying to do is basically
compress<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.640> thing<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.690> come<00:00:59.020> out<00:00:59.170> at<00:00:59.320> home

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
compress that thing and come out at home

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.959 
compress that thing and come out at home
and<00:00:59.770> you<00:00:59.829> can<00:00:59.920> hinge<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.309> up<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.730> put<00:01:03.760> it

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
and you can hinge it up and to put it

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.680 
and you can hinge it up and to put it
down<00:01:04.119> just<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.539> reverse<00:01:05.789> all<00:01:06.789> right<00:01:06.970> now<00:01:07.180> to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
down just a reverse all right now to

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.830 
down just a reverse all right now to
remove<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.289> you<00:01:08.890> have<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.100> disconnect<00:01:09.840> these

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
remove the you have to disconnect these

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.450 
remove the you have to disconnect these
pieces<00:01:11.140> from<00:01:11.440> here<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:11.979> can<00:01:12.130> get<00:01:12.220> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
pieces from here so you can get the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.639 
pieces from here so you can get the
cover<00:01:13.390> off<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:15.160> two<00:01:15.369> things<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:17.350> need<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
cover off we have two things you need to

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.279 
cover off we have two things you need to
remove<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.569> that's<00:01:19.569> for<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.869> lid<00:01:20.050> hinge

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
remove the that's for the lid hinge

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.089 
remove the that's for the lid hinge
that's<00:01:20.590> what<00:01:20.740> tells<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:22.709> tells<00:01:23.709> it<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.890> run

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.099 
that's what tells it to tells it to run

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.889 
that's what tells it to tells it to run
when<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.490> lid<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:24.910> closed<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:25.720> also

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
when the lid is closed and then also

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.109 
when the lid is closed and then also
these<00:01:26.259> hinges

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.249 

you're<00:01:31.119> basically<00:01:31.330> tilting<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.869> thing<00:01:32.080> out

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
you're basically tilting that thing out

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.210 
you're basically tilting that thing out
for<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.500> bottom<00:01:33.899> pops<00:01:34.899> out<00:01:35.170> then<00:01:36.039> you<00:01:36.160> can

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
for the bottom pops out then you can

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.210 
for the bottom pops out then you can
even<00:01:36.459> take<00:01:36.670> these<00:01:36.819> off<00:01:37.560> glass<00:01:38.560> will<00:01:38.770> fall<00:01:39.009> down

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
even take these off glass will fall down

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.480 
even take these off glass will fall down
there<00:01:39.550> just<00:01:39.849> put<00:01:40.090> them<00:01:40.179> aside<00:01:40.240> for<00:01:40.660> later<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
there just put them aside for later and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.969 
there just put them aside for later and
then<00:01:44.489> you<00:01:45.489> can<00:01:45.940> pull<00:01:46.390> off<00:01:46.599> the<00:01:47.380> whole<00:01:47.530> lid<00:01:47.800> it

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
then you can pull off the whole lid it

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.190 
then you can pull off the whole lid it
kind<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.220> hinges<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.700> at<00:01:49.599> the<00:01:49.840> bottom<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
kind of hinges it at the bottom it

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.540 
kind of hinges it at the bottom it
basically<00:01:50.440> it's<00:01:50.590> just<00:01:50.739> come<00:01:50.920> off<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.310> little

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
basically it's just come off of a little

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.040 
basically it's just come off of a little
lip<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.179> if<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.360> just<00:01:52.479> pull<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.720> forward<00:01:52.810> a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
lip so if you just pull it forward a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.559 
lip so if you just pull it forward a
little<00:01:53.080> bit<00:01:53.289> it<00:01:53.470> should<00:01:53.649> all<00:01:54.310> come<00:01:54.729> off<00:01:54.940> I'm

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
little bit it should all come off I'm

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.029 
little bit it should all come off I'm
about<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.899> hit<00:01:55.959> my<00:01:56.110> tripod<00:01:56.530> though<00:01:56.709> so<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:56.920> not

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
about to hit my tripod though so I'm not

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.300 
about to hit my tripod though so I'm not
going<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.280> pull<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.489> any<00:01:57.520> farther<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.950> right

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
going to pull it any farther all right

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.089 
going to pull it any farther all right
so<00:02:03.700> my<00:02:04.509> problem<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.349> this<00:02:05.470> connector

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
so my problem is in this connector

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.520 
so my problem is in this connector
you'll<00:02:06.399> you'll<00:02:06.729> see<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.060> come<00:02:07.330> flashed<00:02:08.200> down

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
you'll you'll see it come flashed down

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.780 
you'll you'll see it come flashed down
here

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.420 

it's<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.709> making<00:02:16.709> all<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.890> connections

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it's just not making all the connections

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.729 
it's just not making all the connections
and<00:02:17.549> as<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.000> plugged<00:02:18.719> in<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.049> mean<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.469> can't

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
and as it is plugged in I mean I can't

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.679 
and as it is plugged in I mean I can't
pull<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:19.950> out<00:02:20.040> past<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.549> thing<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.629> is

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
pull it out past that thing that is

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.899 
pull it out past that thing that is
engaged<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.799> see<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.159> in<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:25.909> it's

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
engaged but you see it in there it's

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.399 
engaged but you see it in there it's
almost<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.359> have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.659> push<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.870> more<00:02:28.109> this

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
almost like I have to push it more this

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:41.429 
almost like I have to push it more this
way

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.979 

all<00:02:42.439> right<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:42.980> look<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.930> has

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
all right so if we look at this it has

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.619 
all right so if we look at this it has
been<00:02:48.290> arcing<00:02:48.799> in<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:50.420> this

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
been arcing in there see this

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.920 
been arcing in there see this
discoloration<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:52.970> kind<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
discoloration so that's kind of the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470 
discoloration so that's kind of the
culprit<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.439> one<00:02:54.560> that's<00:02:55.269> having<00:02:56.269> all<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
culprit the one that's having all the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.670 
culprit the one that's having all the
problems<00:02:56.900> I'm<00:02:57.019> going<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.200> clean<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.620> out

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
problems I'm going to clean that out

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.589 
problems I'm going to clean that out
with<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> file<00:02:58.610> or<00:02:58.849> something<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.329> clean<00:02:59.510> it

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
with a file or something and clean it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.720 
with a file or something and clean it
down<00:02:59.750> here<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:01.400> my<00:03:02.329> fix<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.440> be

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
down here and then my fix is going to be

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.819 
down here and then my fix is going to be
it<00:03:04.730> seems<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.180> when<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:06.650> push

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
it seems like when you do that just push

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.809 
it seems like when you do that just push
it<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.129> way<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.700> fixes<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:10.220> I've<00:03:10.370> got<00:03:10.549> just

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
it that way it fixes it so I've got just

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.240 
it that way it fixes it so I've got just
a<00:03:11.120> regular<00:03:11.840> little<00:03:12.079> paperclip<00:03:12.500> thing<00:03:12.950> but<00:03:13.159> I'm

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
a regular little paperclip thing but I'm

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.240 
a regular little paperclip thing but I'm
going<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.400> use<00:03:13.459> one<00:03:13.730> side<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:15.040> wedge<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
going to use one side of it and wedge it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.180 
going to use one side of it and wedge it
in<00:03:16.400> there<00:03:17.230> just<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.319> put<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.590> extra<00:03:18.769> pressure

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
in there just to put that extra pressure

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.500 
in there just to put that extra pressure
pushing<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.970> way

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
pushing that way

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.260 
pushing that way
and<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.780> hope<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.459> fixes<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.489> for<00:03:22.819> a<00:03:22.849> while

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.960 

all<00:03:30.050> right<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.560> rig<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:32.170> door<00:03:33.170> switch<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
all right so to rig the door switch is a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.840 
all right so to rig the door switch is a
ground<00:03:35.420> wire<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.950> know<00:03:37.190> if<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.490> can<00:03:37.640> see

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
ground wire and you know if you can see

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.940 
ground wire and you know if you can see
it<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.150> there<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.750> can't<00:03:39.530> get<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.830> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
it or not there I can't get to the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.260 
it or not there I can't get to the
connectors<00:03:40.340> really<00:03:40.610> on<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:40.820> side<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.120> these

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
connectors really on this side of these

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.940 
connectors really on this side of these
clips<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.170> them<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.350> this<00:03:42.500> side<00:03:42.740> so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
clips I can get to them on this side so

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.120 
clips I can get to them on this side so
I<00:03:43.010> can<00:03:43.540> come<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.660> here<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.590> get<00:03:45.800> around<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
I can come in here and get around the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.490 
I can come in here and get around the
metal<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.420> ground<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.230> frame

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
metal and just ground it to the frame

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.240 
metal and just ground it to the frame
here<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.900> then<00:03:51.200> all<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.440> door<00:03:51.650> switch<00:03:51.920> does

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
here and then all the door switch does

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.420 
here and then all the door switch does
other<00:03:52.580> than<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.330> basically<00:03:54.430> connect

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
other than that is basically connect

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.090 
other than that is basically connect
these<00:03:55.550> two<00:03:55.850> leads<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.510> again<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.590> can't<00:03:57.830> get<00:03:57.950> to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
these two leads and again I can't get to

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.800 
these two leads and again I can't get to
it<00:03:58.130> from<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.460> front<00:03:58.790> side<00:03:59.060> but<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.360> can't<00:03:59.660> get

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it from that front side but I can't get

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.370 
it from that front side but I can't get
to<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.050> from<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.440> side

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.850 

and<00:04:06.380> that's<00:04:06.620> all<00:04:06.800> I<00:04:06.830> need<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:08.750> actually<00:04:09.650> get<00:04:09.770> it

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
and that's all I need to actually get it

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.010 
and that's all I need to actually get it
to<00:04:09.980> work<00:04:10.100> without<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.670> frame<00:04:11.450> on<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
to work without the frame on and the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.710 
to work without the frame on and the
door<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.380> everything
