me<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.649> look<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> snowfall

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
me now as we look at the snowfall

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
me now as we look at the snowfall
potential<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> storm<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.439> biggest

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
potential with the storm the biggest

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.219 
potential with the storm the biggest
thing<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> note<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.939> believe<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.930> trend

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
thing to note I believe is the trend

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
thing to note I believe is the trend
less<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> west<00:02:08.340> more<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> east

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
less to the west more to the east

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330 
less to the west more to the east
because<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.229> likely<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.590> these<00:02:10.920> totals

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
because we will likely see these totals

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.880 
because we will likely see these totals
jostle<00:02:12.120> up-and-down

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
jostle up-and-down

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
over the next 24 hours but this is what

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.380 
over the next 24 hours but this is what
I<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:15.050> as<00:02:15.230> potential<00:02:15.980> right<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:16.400> well<00:02:17.150> north

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I see as potential right now well north

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
Mother Nature we saw some melting that

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.670 
Mother Nature we saw some melting that
will<00:03:56.090> not<00:03:56.299> be<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.570> case<00:03:56.720> with<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.019> storm<00:03:57.260> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
will not be the case with this storm the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
yesterday's storm should be a little

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.069 
yesterday's storm should be a little
fluffier<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.510> there<00:04:02.660> will<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.840> lot<00:04:02.959> more

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
fluffier so but there will be a lot more

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.289 
fluffier so but there will be a lot more
of<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.470> those<00:04:04.010> dangerous<00:04:04.489> wind<00:04:04.850> chills

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
of it and those dangerous wind chills

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.900 
of it and those dangerous wind chills
so<00:04:05.630> when<00:04:05.840> goes<00:04:06.049> wind<00:04:06.380> chills<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.040> winds<00:04:07.489> we

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
so when goes wind chills the winds we

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.009 
so when goes wind chills the winds we
can<00:04:08.060> actually<00:04:08.180> see<00:04:08.420> some<00:04:08.450> power<00:04:08.780> line

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
can actually see some power line

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.960 
can actually see some power line
problems<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:10.040> know<00:04:10.160> some<00:04:10.430> limbs<00:04:10.700> breaking

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
problems you know some limbs breaking

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.120 
problems you know some limbs breaking
off<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:11.359> several<00:04:12.260> factors<00:04:12.709> come<00:04:12.890> into<00:04:12.920> play

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
off so several factors come into play

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.099 
off so several factors come into play
with<00:04:13.400> blizzard<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.000> get<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.299> batteries<00:04:14.780> as

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
with blizzard so get the batteries as

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.680 
with blizzard so get the batteries as
well<00:04:15.260> as<00:04:15.380> then<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:16.729> case<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.299> have<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.570> be

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
well as then just in case you have to be

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.770 
well as then just in case you have to be
prepared<00:04:17.900> all<00:04:18.320> right

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
prepared all right

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.410
