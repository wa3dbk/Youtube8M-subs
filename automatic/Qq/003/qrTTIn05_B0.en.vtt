lot<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.830> I've<00:04:14.280> enjoyed<00:04:14.640> having<00:04:14.940> her<00:04:15.150> because

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
lot and I've enjoyed having her because

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.840 
lot and I've enjoyed having her because
she<00:04:15.630> does<00:04:15.840> play<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.230> pieces<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.640> think

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
she does play the pieces and I think

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.510

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
years ago that when you're 65 they don't

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.080

fire you they don't lay you off so it's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.000
