00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
to get pressure off the right side and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.410 
to get pressure off the right side and
the<00:00:15.130> play<00:00:15.310> that<00:00:15.400> we're<00:00:15.519> going<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.670> be<00:00:15.760> using<00:00:15.790> is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
the play that we're going to be using is

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.109 
the play that we're going to be using is
cover<00:00:16.840> one<00:00:17.080> robber<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.520> setup<00:00:18.880> for<00:00:19.000> this

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
cover one robber now the setup for this

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.600 
cover one robber now the setup for this
doesn't<00:00:19.510> look<00:00:19.630> much<00:00:19.960> like<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:21.070> setup<00:00:21.310> for<00:00:21.550> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
doesn't look much like the setup for the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.109 
doesn't look much like the setup for the
left<00:00:21.790> edge<00:00:21.939> well<00:00:22.630> that's<00:00:22.779> perfectly<00:00:23.710> fine

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
left edge well that's perfectly fine

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.950 
left edge well that's perfectly fine
basically<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.210> set<00:00:25.390> this<00:00:25.480> up<00:00:25.630> you're<00:00:25.810> going<00:00:25.900> to

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
basically to set this up you're going to

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.540 
basically to set this up you're going to
base<00:00:26.169> a<00:00:26.200> line<00:00:26.470> just<00:00:26.770> like<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:27.070> did<00:00:27.130> in<00:00:27.340> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
base a line just like you did in the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.670 
base a line just like you did in the
left<00:00:28.090> edge<00:00:28.300> eat<00:00:28.480> that's<00:00:29.110> going<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.380> bring<00:00:29.529> this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
left edge eat that's going to bring this

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.290 
left edge eat that's going to bring this
corner<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.279> left<00:00:30.310> side<00:00:30.669> now<00:00:31.029> you<00:00:31.090> don't

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
corner to the left side now you don't

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000 
corner to the left side now you don't
have<00:00:31.360> to<00:00:31.480> wait<00:00:31.689> for<00:00:31.720> him<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.050> go<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.860> left

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
have to wait for him to go to the left

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.790 
have to wait for him to go to the left
side<00:00:33.160> you<00:00:33.190> can<00:00:33.430> just<00:00:33.579> start<00:00:33.730> running<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.180> play

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
side you can just start running the play

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.410 
side you can just start running the play
but<00:00:35.800> from<00:00:35.980> after<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.489> baseline<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.270> guy

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
but from after the baseline that guy

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.610 
but from after the baseline that guy
you're<00:00:37.960> going<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.140> want<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.320> shift<00:00:38.500> your

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
you're going to want to shift your

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.290 
you're going to want to shift your
defensive<00:00:39.039> line<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.430> right<00:00:39.609> then<00:00:39.940> crash

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
defensive line to the right then crash

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.569

the right stick and then whatever his
icon<00:01:10.870> is<00:01:11.050> very<00:01:11.710> quick<00:01:11.980> when<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.490> do<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.670> in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
icon is very quick when you do it in

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.150 
icon is very quick when you do it in
real<00:01:12.850> time<00:01:13.090> look<00:01:13.360> something<00:01:13.660> like<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:14.160> very

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
real time look something like that very

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.890 
real time look something like that very
quick<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.520> then<00:01:15.730> that's<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:16.090> you're<00:01:16.510> set<00:01:16.780> up

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
quick and then that's it you're set up

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.980 
quick and then that's it you're set up
and<00:01:17.190> basically<00:01:18.190> that<00:01:18.490> Center<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.150> stares

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
and basically that Center just stares

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.670 
and basically that Center just stares
and<00:01:20.380> doesn't<00:01:21.160> do<00:01:21.220> anything<00:01:22.500> again<00:01:23.500> very

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and doesn't do anything again very

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.960 
and doesn't do anything again very
simple<00:01:23.920> I'm<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.280> put<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.490> setup<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
simple I'm going to put the setup in the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.240 
simple I'm going to put the setup in the
description<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:26.380> just<00:01:26.560> run<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.010> few

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
description and then just run it a few

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.790 
description and then just run it a few
more<00:01:27.430> times

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.060 

of<00:01:30.280> course<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:30.640> click<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.150> wrong<00:01:31.270> guy
