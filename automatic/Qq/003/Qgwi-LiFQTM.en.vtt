00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
then take inside it looks pretty small

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.209 
then take inside it looks pretty small
from<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.120> outside<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.140> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> big

from the outside but it's kind of big

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
from the outside but it's kind of big

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
as you can see from the side you can see

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
as you can see from the side you can see
it's<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.400> large<00:01:14.610> house<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> front<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's a large house but from the front it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's a large house but from the front it
looks<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.350> small<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
looks pretty small so this is like the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
looks pretty small so this is like the
balcony<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> side<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.560> let<00:01:19.680> me

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
balcony on the side here and then let me

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
balcony on the side here and then let me
just<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just go down there okay so this is like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.960 
just go down there okay so this is like
this<00:01:24.000> side<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:25.250> okay<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:26.939> see

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this side here okay and as you can see

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
this side here okay and as you can see
this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> front<00:01:27.810> beat<00:01:28.080> continues

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this is like the front beat continues

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
this is like the front beat continues
all<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.689> looks

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
all the way to here and think it looks

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.960 
all the way to here and think it looks
pretty<00:01:30.869> cool<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> balcony<00:01:32.790> there

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pretty cool just like the balcony there

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.330 
pretty cool just like the balcony there
as<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.710> quick<00:01:35.070> sneak

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
as you can see you have a quick sneak

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
as you can see you have a quick sneak
peek<00:01:35.610> inside<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> house<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.409> I'm<00:01:37.500> going

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
peek inside the house I think I'm going

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
peek inside the house I think I'm going
