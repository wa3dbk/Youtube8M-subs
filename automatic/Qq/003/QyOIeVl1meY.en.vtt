number one genoa and it's at the top of
its<00:06:05.979> range<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.669> we've<00:06:07.330> hoisted<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.900> sail

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
its range and we've hoisted the sail

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.780 
its range and we've hoisted the sail
with<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.770> minimum<00:06:09.190> amount<00:06:09.370> of<00:06:09.520> love<00:06:09.729> tension

with the minimum amount of love tension

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.210 
with the minimum amount of love tension
and<00:06:10.880> you<00:06:11.660> can<00:06:11.840> see<00:06:12.080> by<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.380> creases<00:06:12.920> coming

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
and you can see by the creases coming

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.550 
and you can see by the creases coming
off<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.490> left<00:06:13.700> that<00:06:14.480> more<00:06:14.990> tension<00:06:15.440> is

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
off the left that more tension is

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.550 
off the left that more tension is
required<00:06:16.240> so<00:06:17.240> Crisco<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.050> put<00:06:18.320> some<00:06:18.470> more

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
required so Crisco you put some more

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.150 
required so Crisco you put some more
tension<00:06:18.770> or<00:06:19.040> I<00:06:19.580> used<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.510> you<00:06:20.950> generally<00:06:21.950> shoot

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
tension or I used to you generally shoot

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.910 
tension or I used to you generally shoot
here<00:06:22.430> so<00:06:22.760> that<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.120> pressure<00:06:23.360> is<00:06:23.920> balanced

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
here so that the pressure is balanced

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:34.070 
here so that the pressure is balanced
that's<00:06:25.550> good<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.690> wind<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.140> sail<00:06:27.380> back<00:06:27.710> in

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.800 

okay<00:06:34.800> we're<00:06:35.550> sailing<00:06:35.909> along<00:06:36.120> here<00:06:36.360> now<00:06:36.539> on<00:06:36.720> the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
okay we're sailing along here now on the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.300 
okay we're sailing along here now on the
boat<00:06:37.020> is<00:06:37.400> overpowered<00:06:38.509> so<00:06:39.509> we<00:06:39.599> need<00:06:39.810> to<00:06:40.310> do

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
boat is overpowered so we need to do

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.029 
boat is overpowered so we need to do
power<00:06:41.669> the<00:06:41.909> genoa<00:06:42.270> and<00:06:42.599> we<00:06:43.229> do<00:06:43.409> this<00:06:43.590> by<00:06:43.830> moving

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
power the genoa and we do this by moving

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.510 
power the genoa and we do this by moving
the<00:06:44.750> sheet<00:06:45.750> lead<00:06:45.930> aft<00:06:46.229> and<00:06:47.009> this<00:06:47.220> will<00:06:47.400> open

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
the sheet lead aft and this will open

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.110 
the sheet lead aft and this will open
the<00:06:47.759> slot<00:06:48.180> and<00:06:49.039> hopefully<00:06:50.039> make<00:06:50.849> it<00:06:50.970> a<00:06:51.000> little

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
the slot and hopefully make it a little

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.529 
the slot and hopefully make it a little
easier<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:55.530> now<00:06:55.650> we<00:06:55.710> can<00:06:55.949> see<00:06:56.159> that<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.539> slot

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
easier and now we can see that the slot

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.350 
easier and now we can see that the slot
is<00:06:57.690> opened<00:06:58.050> up<00:06:58.169> quite<00:06:58.470> a<00:06:58.500> lot<00:06:58.590> you<00:06:59.120> can<00:07:00.120> shoot

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
is opened up quite a lot you can shoot

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.890 
is opened up quite a lot you can shoot
the<00:07:00.479> sail<00:07:00.720> on<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:02.120> boat<00:07:03.120> is<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.300> little<00:07:03.419> easier

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
the sail on the boat is a little easier

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.320 
the sail on the boat is a little easier
to<00:07:04.050> sail<00:07:04.319> and<00:07:04.669> the<00:07:05.669> speed<00:07:06.030> can<00:07:06.240> come<00:07:06.419> back<00:07:08.330> it's

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
to sail and the speed can come back it's

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.790 
to sail and the speed can come back it's
very<00:07:09.599> important<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.199> have<00:07:10.379> the<00:07:10.500> correct

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
very important to have the correct

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.219 
very important to have the correct
leechline<00:07:11.250> tension<00:07:11.940> you<00:07:12.449> don't<00:07:12.659> want<00:07:12.870> to<00:07:13.020> have

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
leechline tension you don't want to have

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.740 
leechline tension you don't want to have
to<00:07:14.099> slacker<00:07:14.520> leechline<00:07:14.849> so<00:07:15.330> the<00:07:15.479> sails

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
to slacker leechline so the sails

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.779 
to slacker leechline so the sails
flogging<00:07:16.229> like<00:07:16.409> now<00:07:16.680> and<00:07:17.039> you<00:07:17.340> don't<00:07:17.550> want<00:07:17.699> to

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:17.789 
flogging like now and you don't want to

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.010 
flogging like now and you don't want to
have<00:07:17.909> too<00:07:18.180> much<00:07:18.360> leechline

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
have too much leechline

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.680 
have too much leechline
so<00:07:19.500> the<00:07:19.740> sail<00:07:20.219> hooks<00:07:20.580> at<00:07:20.849> the<00:07:20.879> back<00:07:21.120> end<00:07:21.419> you

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
so the sail hooks at the back end you

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.010 
so the sail hooks at the back end you
just<00:07:22.379> want<00:07:22.740> to<00:07:22.800> take<00:07:22.979> sufficient<00:07:23.460> tension<00:07:24.180> so

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
just want to take sufficient tension so

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:33.550 
just want to take sufficient tension so
that<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.259> sail<00:07:25.620> quietens<00:07:26.280> down

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.130 

and<00:07:34.040> the<00:07:34.130> same<00:07:34.400> rules<00:07:34.730> apply<00:07:34.940> to<00:07:35.630> the<00:07:35.750> leech<00:07:35.930> of

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140 
and the same rules apply to the leech of

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.940 
and the same rules apply to the leech of
the<00:07:36.260> mainsail<00:07:40.870> we're<00:07:41.870> sailing<00:07:42.320> along<00:07:42.530> and<00:07:42.860> the

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
the mainsail we're sailing along and the

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.580 
the mainsail we're sailing along and the
breeze<00:07:43.670> dies<00:07:44.060> and<00:07:44.480> we<00:07:44.570> need<00:07:44.780> to<00:07:44.960> power<00:07:45.200> up<00:07:45.320> the

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590 
breeze dies and we need to power up the

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.190 
breeze dies and we need to power up the
sail<00:07:45.890> and<00:07:46.430> so<00:07:46.730> we<00:07:46.880> used<00:07:47.090> to<00:07:47.300> back<00:07:47.510> state<00:07:47.900> and

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.200 
sail and so we used to back state and

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.610 
sail and so we used to back state and
this<00:07:48.860> deepens<00:07:49.400> to<00:07:49.580> camber<00:07:50.090> in<00:07:50.690> the<00:07:50.900> upper<00:07:51.230> part

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:51.620 
this deepens to camber in the upper part

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.220 
this deepens to camber in the upper part
of<00:07:51.770> the<00:07:51.920> sail
