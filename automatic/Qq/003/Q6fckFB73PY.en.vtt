00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
this distance all these are breaking at

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.450 
this distance all these are breaking at
the<00:01:48.760> same<00:01:49.080> speed<00:01:50.080> but<00:01:50.650> as<00:01:50.770> soon<00:01:50.920> as<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.189> are

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
the same speed but as soon as you are

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.340 
the same speed but as soon as you are
four<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.970> five<00:01:52.119> blocks<00:01:52.420> away<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.960> start<00:01:53.200> bright

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
four to five blocks away it start bright

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.890 
four to five blocks away it start bright
starts<00:01:53.680> breaking<00:01:53.860> super<00:01:54.189> fast<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.580> watch<00:01:54.700> this

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
starts breaking super fast so watch this

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.719 
starts breaking super fast so watch this
ready<00:01:55.900> look<00:01:56.740> at<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.159> just<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.460> can<00:01:57.640> just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
ready look at that it's just I can just

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.789 
ready look at that it's just I can just
walk<00:01:57.970> by<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:58.869> as<00:01:59.080> soon<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.409> notice<00:01:59.680> as<00:01:59.770> soon

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
walk by now as soon you notice as soon

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.350 
walk by now as soon you notice as soon
as<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.250> hear<00:02:00.430> they<00:02:00.939> slowed<00:02:01.119> down<00:02:01.150> again

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
as I got to hear they slowed down again

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.320 
as I got to hear they slowed down again
so<00:02:01.720> watch<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:02.259> more<00:02:02.380> time<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:04.000> can<00:02:04.150> just

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
so watch this one more time you can just

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.560 
so watch this one more time you can just
stop<00:02:04.570> crap<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.729> I'm<00:02:06.939> going<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.090> start<00:02:07.240> breaking

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
stop crap so I'm going to start breaking

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.759 
stop crap so I'm going to start breaking
these<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.200> let's<00:02:11.200> see<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.410> slow<00:02:11.590> again

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
these and and let's see it's slow again

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.460 
these and and let's see it's slow again
that<00:02:12.220> first<00:02:12.400> block<00:02:12.579> was<00:02:12.700> really<00:02:12.880> fast<00:02:13.090> these

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that first block was really fast these

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.150 
that first block was really fast these
whole<00:02:14.470> lot<00:02:14.620> ready<00:02:15.630> slow<00:02:16.630> slow<00:02:16.930> slow<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.890> as

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
whole lot ready slow slow slow now as

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.350 
whole lot ready slow slow slow now as
you<00:02:18.190> mean<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> may<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:18.880> notice<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.209> really

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you mean you may not notice it really

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.600 
you mean you may not notice it really
well<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.630> I'm<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:20.019> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> put<00:02:20.440> down<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
well so I'm just going to put down this

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.699 
well so I'm just going to put down this
back<00:02:21.850> row<00:02:22.090> here<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.870> show<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.170> to

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
back row here just to show you that to

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.220 
back row here just to show you that to
show<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.920> how<00:02:24.070> fast<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:25.660> by<00:02:25.870> itself

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
show you how fast it is all by itself

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
show you how fast it is all by itself
and<00:02:26.560> hopefully<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.459> see<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> difference

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and hopefully you can see the difference

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.940 
and hopefully you can see the difference
this<00:02:28.599> will<00:02:28.810> probably<00:02:28.989> help<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> guys

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
this will probably help you guys

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.680 
this will probably help you guys
if<00:02:30.010> you're<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> creative<00:02:30.879> builder<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.420> want<00:02:31.569> to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
if you're a creative builder and want to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.190 
if you're a creative builder and want to
break<00:02:32.290> early<00:02:32.500> faster<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.520> super<00:02:33.790> fast

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
break early faster that just super fast

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
break early faster that just super fast
look<00:02:35.200> at<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.379> was<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.769> super<00:02:36.099> super

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
look at that was just like super super

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
look at that was just like super super
fast<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.269> yeah<00:02:37.450> oh<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.050> cool<00:02:38.170> sound<00:02:38.410> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
fast so yeah oh that was a cool sound I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
fast so yeah oh that was a cool sound I
don't<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.739> what<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> was<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> let's

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
don't know what that was but so let's

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750 
don't know what that was but so let's
just<00:02:40.900> let's<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.170> go<00:02:41.379> ahead<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:42.700> how

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
just let's just go ahead and see how

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.580 
just let's just go ahead and see how
fast<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.120> do<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.360> while<00:02:43.510> flying<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.410> this

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
fast you can do it while flying and this

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.660 
fast you can do it while flying and this
is<00:02:44.709> another<00:02:44.920> cool<00:02:45.129> thing<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.459> let's<00:02:45.610> say

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
is another cool thing so let's say

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.030 
is another cool thing so let's say
you're<00:02:45.819> like<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.120> far<00:02:46.330> away<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:47.010> let's<00:02:48.010> just

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you're like this far away and let's just

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.009 
you're like this far away and let's just
actually<00:02:48.220> break<00:02:48.459> these<00:02:48.580> real<00:02:48.760> quick<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.930> you

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
actually break these real quick as you

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.650 
actually break these real quick as you
can<00:02:50.050> see<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.319> slow<00:02:50.500> slow<00:02:50.890> slow<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.540> if

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
can see it's slow slow slow so but if

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.020 
can see it's slow slow slow so but if
you<00:02:52.780> come<00:02:53.080> at<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.470> you're<00:02:53.620> ready<00:02:54.030> like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you come at it and you're ready like

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.610 
you come at it and you're ready like
that<00:02:55.239> see<00:02:55.630> how<00:02:55.690> fast<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.989> was<00:02:56.019> let's<00:02:56.530> just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
that see how fast I was let's just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.430 
that see how fast I was let's just
friggin<00:02:57.250> lacks<00:02:57.489> bikes<00:02:57.790> bob<00:02:58.030> saget<00:02:58.390> anyway<00:02:58.690> so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
friggin lacks bikes bob saget anyway so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
friggin lacks bikes bob saget anyway so
let's<00:02:59.500> say<00:02:59.769> there's<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.519> line<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.819> watermelon

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
let's say there's a line of watermelon

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.390 
let's say there's a line of watermelon
here<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.690> mean<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:02.980> works<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.280> any

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
here I mean this is this works for any

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.680 
here I mean this is this works for any
blocks<00:03:03.730> by<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.000> way<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.209> just<00:03:04.420> want<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.569> say

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
blocks by the way I just want to say

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.940 
blocks by the way I just want to say
that<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.410> come<00:03:05.560> up<00:03:05.650> when<00:03:05.769> you're<00:03:05.860> this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
that and you come up when you're this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.500 
that and you come up when you're this
close<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.370> wanna<00:03:06.489> break<00:03:06.640> them<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:06.910> it's

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
close and you wanna break them all it's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.720 
close and you wanna break them all it's
going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.780> be<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.140> slow<00:03:08.530> that's<00:03:09.160> slow<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.670> I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
going to be this slow that's slow and I

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.009 
going to be this slow that's slow and I
basically<00:03:10.090> went<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> straight<00:03:10.540> line<00:03:10.690> there

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
basically went in a straight line there

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.150 
basically went in a straight line there
but<00:03:12.360> introducing<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.480> new<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.720> improved

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
but introducing the new and improved

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.259 
but introducing the new and improved
method<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.459> come<00:03:15.730> over<00:03:15.819> here<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
method so you come over here in the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.300 
method so you come over here in the
second<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.319> are<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.799> tap<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.190> to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
second that you are just you tap up to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.860
