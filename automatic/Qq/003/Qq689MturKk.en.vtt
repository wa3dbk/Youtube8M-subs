00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.059 
a lot like the Mac I didn't used to have
a<00:03:21.609> iMac<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.060> looks<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:24.200> as<00:03:24.440> good<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:24.919> an

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
a iMac and it looks just as good as an

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.059 
a iMac and it looks just as good as an
iMac<00:03:25.519> uh<00:03:27.310> here's<00:03:28.310> my<00:03:28.370> icons<00:03:28.910> at<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> bottom

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
iMac uh here's my icons at the bottom

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.729 
iMac uh here's my icons at the bottom
the<00:03:31.069> video<00:03:31.220> probably<00:03:31.730> doesn't<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.739> justice

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
the video probably doesn't do it justice

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.159 
the video probably doesn't do it justice
but<00:03:34.419> you<00:03:35.419> know<00:03:35.480> icons<00:03:36.290> are<00:03:36.560> super<00:03:36.980> clear<00:03:38.169> just

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
but you know icons are super clear just

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.920 
but you know icons are super clear just
like<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.500> would<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:39.709> on<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.950> Mac<00:03:43.480> nice<00:03:44.480> now<00:03:44.780> what

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.740 
just by preferences right over here
arrangement<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.130> did<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.060> made<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:23.150> monitor<00:04:24.150> my

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
arrangement I did I made the monitor my

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.940 
arrangement I did I made the monitor my
main<00:04:25.020> display<00:04:26.419> because<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:28.440> know<00:04:28.560> if<00:04:28.770> you

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
main display because you know if you

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.950 
main display because you know if you
have<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.780> MacBook<00:04:31.110> Pro<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:33.630> looks<00:04:33.810> like

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
this and you can't really you know yeah

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.440 
this and you can't really you know yeah
if<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.480> do<00:04:39.630> this<00:04:40.520> if<00:04:41.520> your<00:04:41.669> night<00:04:41.820> book<00:04:42.030> pro<00:04:42.240> is

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
if you do this if your night book pro is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.420 
if you do this if your night book pro is
main<00:04:42.690> display<00:04:43.080> then<00:04:43.620> you'd<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.100> mirror

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
main display then you'd have to mirror

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.159 
main display then you'd have to mirror
the<00:04:44.669> display<00:04:45.090> okay<00:04:46.070> doesn't<00:04:47.070> look<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> same

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
the display okay doesn't look the same

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.120 
the display okay doesn't look the same

but there's a lot of black area okay and

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.900 
but there's a lot of black area okay and
even<00:04:53.400> though<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.640> do<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:56.639> under

even though you do have the under
scanning<00:04:57.419> or<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.990> can<00:04:58.639> make<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.760> screen

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
scanning or you can make the screen

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.530 
scanning or you can make the screen
bigger<00:05:00.300> or<00:05:00.690> smaller<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:03.030> doesn't<00:05:03.330> fill<00:05:03.450> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
bigger or smaller so doesn't fill the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
what you have to do is turn off the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.190 
what you have to do is turn off the
mirroring<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:17.360> just<00:05:18.360> go<00:05:18.479> back<00:05:18.660> over<00:05:18.900> here<00:05:20.000> and

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
mirroring and just go back over here and

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.340 
mirroring and just go back over here and
rearrange<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.500> displays<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:26.370> way<00:05:26.580> I
