 so basically breaking news that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 why the judge was at 5 a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.929
 very important information rather than 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.549
 you actually help me because for 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.560
 find new themes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.699
 or if you have any questions 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.050
 pose is so I will try to there 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.189
 so answer you often on my 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.449
 next videos because there if you 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.980
 want a week ago in russia 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 screenshots and I say no nonsense 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 for the 3 2013 by rockstar but we did not 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 did not really have any information for me 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 it's very difficult already to find 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.380
 topics etc etc 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 it sings I did a lot 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 of things and that's the one and video gta 5 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.870
 I have a lot of requests and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 so if you want me to talk 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.719
 of a certain thing or a theme that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 you want me to approach and say well 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.780
 the me in the comments i'm going 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.520
 look and my comments and then after 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.289
 I 'll see a little bit what theme I 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 could finally look rather dachshund 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.340
 theme I could be studied thanks to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 images and information that we have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.539
 been given to be able to actually given 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 my opinion is rather a friend a review 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 earlier actually actually confirming 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.449
 what we should find in gta 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.410
 bone bag do not forget to tell me all to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.480
 badens the share of donations in the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 comments of this video the silk you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 ask me questions 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.130
 either you have a theme that you want 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.450
 I love being a little I like the video 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.820
 to participate to win 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 points and this live box and that's a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 comment as what will participate 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.790
 and by the way, do not really forget 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.409
 to forget about simply at the level 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 any questions you want or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 themes that you already down to try to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.720
 finally continue the series gta 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250
 singles sure I go there goes on but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.020
 continue let's say in a bigger 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 rhythm with more videos on it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 because you like a lot of video 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 GTA 5 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.990
 and ben me too I like to move well 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.310
 to do it after you have it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 really that are the themes and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.759
 especially things that will suit you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.229
 to interest I'll talk to you again 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.670
 what does not shock that were given I 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.750
 do not do the complete analysis of all 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.369
 screenshots so this passage to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 continue and then I really hope you 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.820
 can you help me on it? 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.500
 really and I really wanted to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 give you a little information role 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.560
 of this picture there because I have you 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.899
 given as she did a lot of information 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.579
 is there it's graphically look at 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.630
 level of the sun at the level of the clouds 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.579
 it's not like before as danger 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 to four where you have some kind of hunger 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.070
 if it's not at all the same texture if 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.700
 you want it's really a 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 difference 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.840
 we will really feel actually in 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 the new generations that we are also going 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120
 feel on playstation 4 and xbox 360 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.290
 but on xbox wii and playstation 4 that's 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.030
 really something compared really 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.260
 feel at the texture level at 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.150
 level of image quality 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.010
 So after that depends on when is it 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.080
 will not come out at all the same in fact if 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.310
 you want as in gta iv where we 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.569
 feels like it's a sticker 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.580
 clouds or something else 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.530
 even at the vineyard level you know 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.390
 you look at vehicles at the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.250
 level headlights headlights rear lights 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.900
 before having the impression that it is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.390
 really a sticker from elsewhere at 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.250
 look at the 1 flexibility of a gta iv and me 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.569
 compare to simple gta we lead we can 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.819
 see because a fleet or it's 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.319
 downright different slick we know this is 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.360
 not at all the same thing these detections 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.440
 appropriate in fact to the topics covered 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.700
 ie to the vehicles and they 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.340
 were stayed so there is really 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.680
 something unique in all that 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 you will be able to touch in gta in 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.130
 gta 5 earlier and I think it's ok 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.299
 really be very beautiful so what we 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.260
 can also see on this image there what 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.840
 who is funny enough 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.100
 obolon certainly know for example 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.380
 at the cactus level there will be some 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.910
 cactus ratio we find this here on 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.920
 a desert terrain so good at the level 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.180
 cacti there will be there is also a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.790
 small service station to another 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.950
 right with a police helicopter and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.359
 a company car so not the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.769
 police so a police car you 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.200
 want who is pursuing in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.060
 does very well eventually so I got 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.799
 said at the level of chases 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.420
 so just before yes at the level of 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.500
 vehicles on the year the vehicle I 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.690
 think it's really a vehicle 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.819
 already he did not leave necessarily proprio 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.079
 field and it's not a nice vehicle I 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.030
 think we can find everywhere 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's really a vehicle where we go 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.970
 find in some places it's 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.470
 like for example if we end up so 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.569
 on a desert ground we will no longer 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.090
 find buggy vehicles all that 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.680
 but more vehicles we will say 4.4 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.209
 and that these texts then compare if one 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.440
 is in the city 4.4 or 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.700
 buggy I think we're not really going 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.680
 finally found the four premium cases and 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.389
 buggy so I would not be surprised 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.500
 lead will no longer end up in town you 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.930
 know of beautiful cars 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.250
 lamborghini and his states if we 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.049
 found anyway to the synthesis in 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.790
 a very rich neighborhood also a neighborhood 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.900
 poor where there will be vehicles of 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.670
 of less high-end which is everything to 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.620
 is normal I really want to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.390
 also talk to you about sowing the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.859
 basic font even if you find yourself in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.019
 a desert place it may be 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.450
 simpler actually eventually to sow 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.980
 the police just need to do a little 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.930
 acceleration shot and then in the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.600
 mountains etc taristas but also this 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.889
 option makes police helicopters 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.330
 who will also pursue you so 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.130
 that he is going that will not facilitate the task 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.750
 that it will be much more difficult if 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.889
 you have a police helicopter in 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.449
 your facebook if you find 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.850
 certainly in a desert place 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.810
 we must not try to see too many 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.830
 because if there are 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.110
 price helicopters it will be enough 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.120
 difficult for you from those put all this 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.500
 there was also want to talk to you 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.449
 so that's not it I will not you 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.099
 show but also from a screenshot that has 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.610
 been given at the level of reflection on 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.889
 cars 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.810
 because here we see three vehicles 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.990
 including two of two police vehicles 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.639
 with the vehicle or crumpled trevor mikel 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.740
 or franklin who is in the process of 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.900
 sow but we can see a fact 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.550
 finally thinking about the vehicle 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.050
 there and I think it's really as 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.669
 something that rockstar has a lot 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.740
 a lot of work lately 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.240
 in recent years ie at 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.159
 level of reflection ie 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.900
 well here you can see through and 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.639
 you can certainly see you too 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.849
 the character so we'll see that more 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.770
 late 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.360
 but not because just this screenshot 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.800
 there we can see a lot of things to 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.060
 through it can even see pretty much what 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.370
 that there is next to the level of buildings 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.590
 and his texts to and so I found good 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.810
 it was also a good way for you 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.520
 say it all well screenshot this is 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.010
 here where we actually feel that 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.830
 michael and goro so that's more the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.900
 shooting who was president not 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.729
 after it is sure good I exceed 50 years 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.470
 believe about so that's for sure at this age 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.760
 there we are champions begins to take 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.699
 a little weight even from thirty 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.110
 30 40 43 years old starts to take a little 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.190
 of even weight it's on the free have they 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.240
 does a lot more sports finally 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.979
 compared to other people who have 50 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.539
 that's for sure but somewhere good in 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.940
 online it's not someone great guy 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.190
 super thin or normal that's true 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.449
 he took a little weight but hey 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.830
 it's a character in itself that is 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.090
 like that and then hey maybe it's not 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.650
 necessarily then the chainmasters such as 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.509
 for sure they will probably go 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.080
 the less said you dream art is him a 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.669
 little more crazy then also at the level of his 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.979
 geographical location or is it 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.380
 is really we do not really know a 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.669
 sort of nightclub 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.630
 we can see by cons clouds in 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.340
 top left of the screen 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.750
 so we can ask ourselves a lot of 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.949
 questions a kind of nightclub in 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.560
 anyway sure it must be a 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.479
 where it's from the hardboard here it must have been 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.909
 to have action a lot of things 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.530
 on it coming up so that 's risky 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.080
 to be a place where I think we're going 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.729
 enjoy well at the level of small years 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.590
 last with this screenshot where we can 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.300
 see so I think that's it I 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.060
 do not have the screenshot are mounted but 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.380
 if he does not say stupidity it's michael 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.800
 if I do not have to aim this weekend that 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.289
 holds a kind of 9 mm in the hand and 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.580
 if you want to actually have a lot of 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.289
 details on not call as before 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.880
 you have a lot less and I 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.580
 asked the question about is that 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.380
 finally there is a resemblance with 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.449
 max payne 3 at the level of men is 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.699
 very well done all that I said to myself 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.169
 are you hungry and 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.789
 apart it makes sense or obstacles have 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.870
 not developed that the series gta they have 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.550
 developed by the full of other games 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.430
 especially deco is not framed venture 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.620
 max payne 3 x 17 ar is a kind of 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.659
 fusion stuff all great more 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.300
 great games that they also released at 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.610
 gta side next to the gta series and 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.050
 well they will put it in gta 5 so 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.090
 raised it's really going to be a cardboard 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.110
 gta 5 and for example here at the level of 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.180
 men that makes a little resemblance 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.940
 compared to max payne 3 the video is 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.140
 finished thank you put a little Javanese 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.280

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.010

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.030
 personal and especially also the thing the 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.990
 more important it's really about me 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.850
 say in the comments what you 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.320
 think all this is what you want 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.120
 that I approach certain themes or that I 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.070
 continue on this rhythm the sphere of life 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.390
 about 2 gta 5 in the week or 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.740
 maybe try to do a little bit more 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.050
 but you will have to really meddle 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.340
 find me ideas in fact of course 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.050
 I've found some since the 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.250
