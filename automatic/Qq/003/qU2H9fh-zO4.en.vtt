00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.980 
other things that have that that color
in<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.700> antioxidant<00:01:57.540> also

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
in it and it this antioxidant also

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.100 
in it and it this antioxidant also
reduces<00:01:58.770> inflammation<00:01:59.390> because<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
reduces inflammation because of the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.319 
reduces inflammation because of the
higher<00:02:01.320> concentration<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> antioxidant

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
higher concentration of that antioxidant

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.029 
higher concentration of that antioxidant
and<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.829> actually<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> has<00:02:05.990> more

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
and and as actually it has more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.440 
and and as actually it has more
antioxidants<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.819> rice<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
antioxidants this rice has more

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
antioxidants this rice has more
antioxidants<00:02:10.140> than<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.440> spoonful<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
antioxidants than a spoonful of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.390 
antioxidants than a spoonful of
blueberries<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.540> how<00:02:12.720> high<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
blueberries so that's how high of the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.570 
blueberries so that's how high of the
antioxidants<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.630> rice<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
antioxidants that are in this rice and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.020 
antioxidants that are in this rice and
it<00:02:17.580> also<00:02:17.940> reduces<00:02:18.690> inflammation<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it also reduces inflammation so and and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
it also reduces inflammation so and and
if<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:22.080> cancer<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.950> an

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
if so if you have cancer it's an

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.260 
if so if you have cancer it's an
excellent<00:02:23.580> thing<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.940> eat<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.740> its

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
excellent thing to eat because of its

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.550 
excellent thing to eat because of its
anti-inflammatory<00:02:27.270> properties<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
anti-inflammatory properties and and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.830 
anti-inflammatory properties and and
with<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:28.950> rice<00:02:29.190> don't<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.390> eat<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
with all rice don't you know eat it in

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
moderation don't eat a whole load of it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.970

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
because if you have blood sugar problems

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.080 
because if you have blood sugar problems
it<00:02:35.130> may<00:02:35.280> mess<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090

I<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.390> white<00:02:36.750> rice<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.440> one<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
I know white rice is like one of the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.340 
I know white rice is like one of the
worst<00:02:37.920> things<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> eat<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.850> lot<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.020> I'm<00:02:40.200> not

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
worst things to eat a lot of but I'm not

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.290 
worst things to eat a lot of but I'm not
sure<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.040> black<00:02:41.280> rice<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.180> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
sure about this black rice but just you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.750 
sure about this black rice but just you
know<00:02:42.420> eat<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.750> moderation<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.640> know

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
know eat in moderation because you know

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.640 
know eat in moderation because you know
when<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.090> cancer<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.200> gonna<00:02:46.290> get

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
when you have cancer and it's gonna get

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.530 
when you have cancer and it's gonna get
converted<00:02:47.010> over<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> sugar<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.820> rice<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
converted over to sugar the rice you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.910 
converted over to sugar the rice you
don't<00:02:48.720> want<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.080> eat<00:02:49.200> too<00:02:49.350> much<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.650> because

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
don't want to eat too much of it because

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.850 
don't want to eat too much of it because
cancer<00:02:50.220> does<00:02:50.600> live<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.840> feeds<00:02:52.200> off<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.620> sugar

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
cancer does live it feeds off of sugar

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.030 
cancer does live it feeds off of sugar

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and what else I'm trying to see I don't

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.790 
and what else I'm trying to see I don't

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
think after this video I'm starving I'm

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.250 
think after this video I'm starving I'm
going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.400> saute<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.120> up<00:03:15.300> with<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.720> little<00:03:16.140> bit

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
going to saute this up with a little bit

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.520 
going to saute this up with a little bit
of<00:03:16.290> olive<00:03:16.590> oil<00:03:16.920> sea<00:03:17.430> salt<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.000> pepper<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.380> I

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
of olive oil sea salt and pepper and I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.040 
of olive oil sea salt and pepper and I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
think we add some garlic and onions to

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.050 
think we add some garlic and onions to
it<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.350> will<00:03:22.680> be<00:03:22.980> absolutely<00:03:23.580> delicious

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.850 
it so that will be absolutely delicious
and<00:03:24.840> also<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.350> make<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:27.860> salad

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and also you can make it into a a salad

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.590 
and also you can make it into a a salad
with<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.760> could<00:03:29.910> make<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.330> into<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
with it and you could make it into a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.630 
with it and you could make it into a
rice<00:03:30.840> pudding<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.830> would<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.130> did<00:03:32.489> this
