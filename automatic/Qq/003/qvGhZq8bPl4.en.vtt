00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.040
 very good we are all here in a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 new video of grand theft auto 5 in the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.529
 let's go over all the news 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.900
 what there was during the week is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.009
 the first one I hope for a long series in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 which we are going to review in addition to the 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.630
 news we will make corrections with 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.830
 with respect to previous weeks or days 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.019
 previous and also deepen in 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 the ideas that you have left in 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.370
 the comments in each of the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.440
 Videos in this case we will discuss the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.870
 ideas that have been put in the videos 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 of the analysis that I made of the gameplay 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.410
 trailer of grand theft auto 5 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.600
 I want to announce that they will usually be 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 short videos videos of no more than two 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470
 minutes probably to be 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.600
 amenos so that they are easy to see for 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.340
 that according to the video you see it already 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 you're looking forward to seeing the next one 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.300
 week let's go if you like it if you do not like it 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.350
 obviously, you are not wishing 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.590
 see anything in the case of this video we're going 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.979
 to correct what I did what I said 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.650
 bad in the video analysis and we're also going 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.540
 to deepen in diverse ideas they have 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.430
 proposed with respect to issues that 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 are still not resolved from the analysis 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.310
 as for example in the famous 83 days 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.090
 that came out in the analysis so without 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.090
 more we started 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
 and well as the first subject we have this the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.270
 theme of the icons in which I said 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.840
 that that symbol was a gas mask 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.520
 but it's not a parachute and it's a 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.230
 fat fault on my part because it's the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 same icon that appeared in the ballad 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.070
 of gay Tony so that's just that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.070
 for chickens is already 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.170
 as a second theme we have the theme of 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.090
 internet in which the cursor symbol 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.159
 it is not made with the index finger but 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.530
 what is done with the middle finger as 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.710
 If they were insulting you, let's go 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.009
 take out the finger that is said and good is a 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.149
 curiosity they just asked me 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.950
 also for the driving that I get 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.630
 it had appeared and real but it is true 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 that although in several scenes and that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.489
 it seems a little bit fake a bit 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.530
 that makes a few unexpected turns that 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.880
 you would probably have to crash in 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.310
 the scenes in which it appears 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.070
 driving the clover your pick up then the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.989
 truth is that they are not real tennis 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.340
 in fact it seems perfect to me in the 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.070
 grand theft auto 4 was like driving 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.560
 boats instead here already so like 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.019
 You see, this is more achieved in my 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.819
 opinion just that just the scene of 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.830
 speed shown above 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.840
 Well yes it is a little more false but 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.130
 is cut off at the moment so that by 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.140
 what to worry about 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.550
 finally about the 83 days that 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.080
 you have to say about that because it's a 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.510
 theory that is quite widespread is 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.310
 that those 83 days those that are missing for 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.130
 be able to enjoy the servers online 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.690
 of the multiplayer because it's 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.190
 fourth box between the sector of 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.940
 characters would be to play multiplayer 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.680
 simply and that's why 83 10 83 are missing 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.690
 days because the gameplay would be recorded 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.670
 two weeks before with what were the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.860
 days left to enable the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.540
 servers finally say that good 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.030
 that this series is going to continue 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.800
 let's wait for a long time and leave 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.750
 your comments to follow 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.440
 from there thank you very much and even the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.440
 next goodbye 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.159
 yes
