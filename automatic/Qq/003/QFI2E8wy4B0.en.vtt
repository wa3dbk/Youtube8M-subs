need<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.150> basic<00:00:18.330> answer<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.949> yes<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.660> lot

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
need it and my basic answer is yes a lot

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.790 
need it and my basic answer is yes a lot
of<00:00:21.720> research<00:00:22.050> around<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.439> now<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.680> not

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
of research around this now I'm not

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.140 
of research around this now I'm not
saying<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.279> become<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> bodybuilder

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
saying they have become a bodybuilder

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.810 
saying they have become a bodybuilder
but<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.380> basic<00:00:25.830> sentences<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.460> life<00:00:26.609> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
but one of my basic sentences in life is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
but one of my basic sentences in life is
that<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.180> no<00:00:27.390> substitute<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:27.990> strength

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that there is no substitute for strength

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
that there is no substitute for strength
when<00:00:29.279> people<00:00:29.519> come<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:29.880> education

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
when people come to our education

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.730 
when people come to our education
program<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.170> excited<00:00:31.289> about

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
program they get really excited about

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.020 
program they get really excited about
helping<00:00:31.859> people<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.340> out<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> pain<00:00:32.759> through

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
helping people get out of pain through

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.940 
helping people get out of pain through
moving<00:00:33.510> better<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.380> taking<00:00:34.649> care<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.829> their

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

skin and their breathing and all this

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.700 
skin and their breathing and all this
kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> crazy<00:00:36.840> stuff<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.380> teach<00:00:37.590> about

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
kind of crazy stuff that we teach about

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.700 
kind of crazy stuff that we teach about
neurology<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.379> our

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
neurology but then when most of our

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.229 
neurology but then when most of our
advanced<00:00:41.280> trainers<00:00:41.579> come<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> our<00:00:41.940> strength

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
advanced trainers come to our strength

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
advanced trainers come to our strength
course<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:42.870> learn<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
course what they learn is that one of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.420 
course what they learn is that one of
the<00:00:44.910> key<00:00:45.149> components<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> being<00:00:46.200> pain-free<00:00:46.860> or

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the key components to being pain-free or

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
the key components to being pain-free or
getting<00:00:47.700> rid<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.180> pain<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.719> also<00:00:48.989> being<00:00:49.170> strong

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
getting rid of pain is also being strong

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
getting rid of pain is also being strong
now<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> discovered<00:00:51.780> again<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.140> over<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
now what I discovered again and over the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.450 
now what I discovered again and over the
years<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.649> working<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.010> thousands<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
years are working with thousands of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.100 
years are working with thousands of
people<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.510> many<00:00:54.690> people<00:00:54.870> avoid

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
people is that many people avoid

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
people is that many people avoid
strength<00:00:55.649> training<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
strength training because I think it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.610 
strength training because I think it's
too<00:00:56.879> hard<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
too hard and like I don't really want to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
too hard and like I don't really want to
go<00:00:58.710> click<00:00:59.010> pick<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.340> renie<00:00:59.579> heavy<00:00:59.820> stuff<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
go click pick up renie heavy stuff and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
go click pick up renie heavy stuff and
today<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> talk<00:01:01.890> about<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
today what I'm about to talk about is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.889 
today what I'm about to talk about is
super<00:01:02.670> important<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.690> vast

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
super important because the vast

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
super important because the vast
majority<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.439> people<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.860> who<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.400> not

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
majority of people out there who are not

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.070 
majority of people out there who are not
trying<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> competitive<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.750> strength

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
trying to be competitive to strength

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
trying to be competitive to strength
athletes<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
athletes can actually get a really

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530 
athletes can actually get a really
really<00:01:09.570> nice<00:01:10.080> benefit<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:11.549> changing<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
really nice benefit from changing the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
really nice benefit from changing the
way<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.170> strength

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
way that they think about strength

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
way that they think about strength
training<00:01:13.939> over<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.150> few<00:01:15.360> years<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
training over the last few years what

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
training over the last few years what
we're<00:01:15.900> seeing<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.040> growth<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we're seeing is a kind of big growth in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
we're seeing is a kind of big growth in
research<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> says<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
research that says you know what you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.630 
research that says you know what you
don't<00:01:19.439> always<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> lift<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.520> heavy

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
don't always have to lift really heavy

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
don't always have to lift really heavy
in<00:01:21.060> order<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.600> stronger<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.409> don't

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
in order to get stronger you don't

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.780 
in order to get stronger you don't
always<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> lift<00:01:23.130> heavy<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.640> get

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
always have to lift heavy to get

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.429 
always have to lift heavy to get
hypertrophy<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.080> always<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hypertrophy you don't always have to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
hypertrophy you don't always have to
look<00:01:25.560> lift<00:01:25.920> heavy<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.640> better-looking

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
look lift heavy to get better-looking

look lift heavy to get better-looking
whenever<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> whatever<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.009> if

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
whenever you want to whatever it is if

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
whenever you want to whatever it is if
your<00:01:29.369> goal<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:30.750> doing<00:01:30.900> strength<00:01:31.110> training

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
your goal is for doing strength training

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
your goal is for doing strength training
so<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> most<00:01:32.340> interesting<00:01:32.579> studies

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so one of the most interesting studies

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
so one of the most interesting studies
that<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> looked<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.049> recently<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that have looked at recently it was a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.870 
that have looked at recently it was a
comparison<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.159> sunny<00:01:38.310> Canada<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
comparison and it was sunny Canada and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
comparison and it was sunny Canada and
they<00:01:38.939> took<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> bunch<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> people<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.350> had

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
they took a bunch of people and they had

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
they took a bunch of people and they had
them<00:01:40.619> try<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:40.920> different<00:01:41.189> tests<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:42.150> right

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
them try two different tests all right

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.550 
them try two different tests all right
so<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.689> had<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.990> group<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.409> doing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so they had one group that was doing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.469 
so they had one group that was doing
very<00:01:43.829> heavy<00:01:44.189> strength<00:01:44.490> training<00:01:44.759> they<00:01:45.420> were

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
very heavy strength training they were

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
very heavy strength training they were
lifting<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.990> 90<00:01:46.409> percent<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> their<00:01:47.100> one

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
lifting about 90 percent of their one

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.210 
lifting about 90 percent of their one
rep<00:01:47.430> max<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.149> whatever<00:01:48.500> set<00:01:49.500> scheme<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
rep max for whatever set scheme and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.440 
rep max for whatever set scheme and
that's<00:01:50.340> usually<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.119> low

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that's usually gonna be a very low

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
that's usually gonna be a very low
number<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> repetitions<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:53.100> took

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
number of repetitions and they took

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.740 
number of repetitions and they took
another<00:01:53.520> group<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.450> lifting

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
another group and they had them lifting

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380 
another group and they had them lifting
30<00:01:55.079> percent<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.159> 30<00:01:56.460> percent<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
30 percent now 30 percent is the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.670 
30 percent now 30 percent is the
equivalent<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.140> doing<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.439> push<00:01:58.649> up

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
equivalent of kind of doing a push up

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760 
equivalent of kind of doing a push up
against<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> wall<00:01:59.430> all<00:02:00.180> right<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.990> breathing

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
against the wall all right so breathing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.789 
against the wall all right so breathing
lightly<00:02:02.130> loaded<00:02:02.390> strength<00:02:03.390> training<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
lightly loaded strength training and so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.190 
lightly loaded strength training and so
what<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.520> started<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> figure<00:02:06.149> out<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
what they started to figure out is that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.669 
what they started to figure out is that
if<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:08.220> apply<00:02:08.610> an<00:02:08.670> equal<00:02:09.030> effort<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.080> here's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
if they apply an equal effort and here's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.110 
if they apply an equal effort and here's
the<00:02:10.800> important<00:02:11.160> part<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.760> apply<00:02:12.060> an

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the important part if they apply an

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.450 
the important part if they apply an
equal<00:02:12.330> effort<00:02:12.720> they<00:02:13.680> both

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
equal effort they both

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.340 
equal effort they both
bigger<00:02:14.850> they<00:02:15.210> both<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.630> stronger<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.230> this

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
bigger they both got stronger now this

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
bigger they both got stronger now this
was<00:02:16.500> males<00:02:16.740> obviously<00:02:17.640> females<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.180> tend

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
was males obviously females don't tend

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.840 
was males obviously females don't tend
to<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.540> bigger<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.110> men<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.680> very<00:02:19.980> often<00:02:20.400> but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
to get bigger like men do very often but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.300 
to get bigger like men do very often but
they<00:02:21.000> would<00:02:21.300> also<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.690> stronger<00:02:22.050> now

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
they would also get stronger now

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.340 
they would also get stronger now
the<00:02:23.520> cool<00:02:23.790> part<00:02:23.820> about<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.690> again<00:02:24.780> it's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the cool part about this and again it's

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.900 
the cool part about this and again it's
very<00:02:25.440> intriguing<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:26.520> actually<00:02:26.670> were

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
very intriguing if they actually were

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.480 
very intriguing if they actually were
looking<00:02:27.240> at<00:02:27.620> anabolic<00:02:28.620> properties<00:02:29.340> now

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
looking at anabolic properties now

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.160 
looking at anabolic properties now
people<00:02:29.880> heard<00:02:30.060> an<00:02:30.180> anabolic<00:02:30.450> steroids<00:02:31.020> those

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
people heard an anabolic steroids those

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
people heard an anabolic steroids those
are<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.350> hormones<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.490> some

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
are the hormones that you know some

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.430 
are the hormones that you know some
people<00:02:33.090> take<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.990> get<00:02:34.170> bigger<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
people take and we get bigger and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.890 
people take and we get bigger and
stronger<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.090> they<00:02:36.090> were<00:02:36.150> measuring<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
stronger and they were measuring the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.480 
stronger and they were measuring the
impact<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.800> these<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.160> different

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
impact of these two different

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.180 
impact of these two different
transferring<00:02:39.120> training<00:02:39.450> measures<00:02:39.750> on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
transferring training measures on

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.890 
transferring training measures on
anabolic<00:02:41.190> hormones<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.330> were<00:02:42.420> creatively

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
anabolic hormones that were creatively

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660 
anabolic hormones that were creatively
within<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> body<00:02:43.740> itself<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.430> found

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
within the body itself and they found

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.790 
within the body itself and they found
that<00:02:44.820> they<00:02:44.970> were<00:02:45.030> relatively<00:02:45.480> equal<00:02:46.020> rather

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
that they were relatively equal rather

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.950 
that they were relatively equal rather
regardless<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.820> heavy<00:02:48.030> weight<00:02:48.240> or<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
regardless of the heavy weight or the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.130 
regardless of the heavy weight or the
light<00:02:49.140> weight<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.990> researchers<00:02:51.990> are

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
light weight and so the researchers are

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.450 
light weight and so the researchers are
now<00:02:52.230> looking<00:02:52.410> deeper<00:02:52.860> into<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.340> they're

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
now looking deeper into this and they're

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460 
now looking deeper into this and they're
saying<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.790> when<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> seems<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
saying you know when it seems like the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.350 
saying you know when it seems like the
last<00:02:55.710> effort<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.670> you're<00:02:56.790> making<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.210> long

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
last effort that you're making as long

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.480 
last effort that you're making as long
as<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:57.630> intense<00:02:57.990> that's<00:02:58.740> really<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> key

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
as it's intense that's really the key

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.760 
as it's intense that's really the key
and<00:02:59.820> based<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> neural<00:03:01.020> neural<00:03:01.530> lens

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and based on the neural neural lens

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.410 
and based on the neural neural lens
right<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> brain<00:03:02.610> Lance<00:03:02.820> which<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> how<00:03:03.210> we<00:03:03.270> know

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
right a brain Lance which is how we know

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.790 
right a brain Lance which is how we know
everything<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.780> eHealth<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.320> makes<00:03:04.530> sense

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
everything is eHealth that makes sense

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.290 
everything is eHealth that makes sense
because<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.280> need<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.490> threaten<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.060> brain

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
because we need to threaten the brain

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.630 
because we need to threaten the brain
enough<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> say<00:03:06.930> hey<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:07.980> happens<00:03:08.520> again

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
enough to say hey if this happens again

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.790 
enough to say hey if this happens again
and<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.000> ready<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.740> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
and be ready for it but not so much that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.980

it<00:03:11.040> goes<00:03:11.130> out<00:03:11.340> I'm<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:11.910> gonna<00:03:12.030> curl<00:03:12.360> up<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
it goes out I'm just gonna curl up and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.010 
it goes out I'm just gonna curl up and
hide<00:03:13.130> so<00:03:14.130> here's<00:03:14.940> my<00:03:15.090> suggestions<00:03:15.570> for<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.840> in

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
hard at the end of your set I usually

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120 
hard at the end of your set I usually
tell<00:03:39.990> people<00:03:40.020> don't<00:03:40.470> go<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.710> way<00:03:40.800> to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
failure leave 1 to 3 reps in the bank if

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680 
failure leave 1 to 3 reps in the bank if
you<00:03:44.130> want<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> call<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.360> push

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
you want to call it that but push

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.290 
you want to call it that but push
yourself<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.560> at<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.860> end<00:03:47.040> now<00:03:47.430> what

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
yourself right up at the end now what

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.660 
yourself right up at the end now what
you'll<00:03:48.450> find<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:49.050> most<00:03:49.140> people<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.770> that<00:03:49.800> if

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
you'll find for most people is that if

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.310 
you'll find for most people is that if
you<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.840> with<00:03:51.960> some<00:03:52.110> level

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
you do that you do with some level

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.900 
you do that you do with some level
regularity<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.100> can<00:03:53.220> get<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> lot<00:03:53.610> stronger

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
regularity you can get a lot stronger

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.940 
regularity you can get a lot stronger
but<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.900> won't<00:03:55.110> feel<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.590> wearing<00:03:55.800> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
but it won't feel like it's wearing you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.270 
but it won't feel like it's wearing you
out<00:03:56.130> as<00:03:56.370> much<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:57.240> last<00:03:57.570> tip<00:03:58.050> on<00:03:58.230> this<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:59.040> if

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
out as much now last tip on this is if

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.950 
out as much now last tip on this is if
you<00:03:59.370> pick<00:03:59.550> something<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.210> can<00:04:00.360> do<00:04:00.480> fifty

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
you pick something that you can do fifty

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.660 
you pick something that you can do fifty
to<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.110> hundred<00:04:01.170> times<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:02.040> probably<00:04:02.430> too

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
to a hundred times that's probably too

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.270 
to a hundred times that's probably too
light<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.720> you've<00:04:03.930> heard<00:04:04.110> 30<00:04:04.590> percent<00:04:05.070> rep

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
light so you've heard 30 percent rep

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.650 
light so you've heard 30 percent rep
schemes<00:04:05.640> should<00:04:05.760> allow<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.300> complete

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
schemes should allow you to complete

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020 
schemes should allow you to complete
maybe<00:04:06.810> 20<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.320> 25<00:04:07.680> repetitions<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.850> will

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
maybe 20 to 25 repetitions that will

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.310 
maybe 20 to 25 repetitions that will
prevent<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.390> from<00:04:09.420> getting<00:04:09.750> bored<00:04:09.930> and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
prevent you from getting bored and

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.410 
prevent you from getting bored and
stopping<00:04:10.680> there<00:04:11.640> should<00:04:11.820> also<00:04:12.000> be<00:04:12.120> enough

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
stopping there should also be enough

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.810 
stopping there should also be enough
work<00:04:13.020> for<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.800> start<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.580> make<00:04:14.700> some

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
work for you to start to make some

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.990 
work for you to start to make some
changes<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.950> here's<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> idea<00:04:17.460> ultimately

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
changes so here's the idea ultimately

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.670 
changes so here's the idea ultimately
you<00:04:18.450> don't<00:04:18.630> have<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.960> always<00:04:19.170> lift<00:04:19.530> heavy

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
you don't have to always lift heavy

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.220 
you don't have to always lift heavy
stuff<00:04:19.770> in<00:04:20.250> order<00:04:20.460> to<00:04:20.549> get<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.910> lot<00:04:21.090> stronger<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
stuff in order to get a lot stronger to

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.290 
stuff in order to get a lot stronger to
hypertrophy<00:04:22.800> your<00:04:22.950> muscles<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.910> look<00:04:24.120> better

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
hypertrophy your muscles to look better

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.840 
hypertrophy your muscles to look better
and<00:04:24.480> perform<00:04:24.990> better<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.320> sports<00:04:25.620> now<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.700> is

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
and perform better in sports now this is

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.250 
and perform better in sports now this is
up

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
up

up
general<00:04:27.860> obviously<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.580> you're<00:04:28.670> competitive

athlete<00:04:29.420> we<00:04:29.510> may<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.870> look<00:04:29.990> at<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.230> a

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
athlete we may have to look at it a

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.410 
athlete we may have to look at it a
different<00:04:30.320> way<00:04:30.730> but<00:04:31.730> for<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:31.970> vast<00:04:32.210> majority

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
different way but for the vast majority

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.050 
different way but for the vast majority
of<00:04:32.750> us<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.110> can<00:04:33.230> accomplish<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.710> lot<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.940> way

of us we can accomplish a lot in a way

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.910 
of us we can accomplish a lot in a way
that<00:04:35.210> we<00:04:35.270> can<00:04:35.420> enjoy<00:04:35.540> which<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.500> ultimately

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
that we can enjoy which is ultimately

that we can enjoy which is ultimately
the<00:04:37.250> point<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.580> exercise<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.600> there<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.260> have

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
the point of exercise so there you have

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.660 
the point of exercise so there you have
it<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.680> have<00:04:39.770> questions<00:04:40.100> about<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.400> let
