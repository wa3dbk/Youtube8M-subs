00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.020
 hi everyone today I'm going to talk about something 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.660
 that I wrote a few months ago in the 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.080
 book effects that is brushing in 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.759
 dry or the droid because it is known and is 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.230
 a theme that many and many of you 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.600
 they have been asking me why is it 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.220
 what men and women can do and 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.320
 they ask what it is and what they are for 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.390
 the benefits good brushing and dry 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.760
 it's my favorite way to exfoliate the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 skin and there are several reasons why 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.400
 so I say this when we 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.799
 we use a brush to stimulate the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.690
 skin we are doing many things a 

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:39.820
 we are stimulating the lymphatic system 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.650
 which it is responsible to take all 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.210
 toxins of our body we are 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.729
 starting our system 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.739
 We are also helping to circulate 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.170
 our system immune system 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.449
 hormonal and somehow we're 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.879
 making our whole body like 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.890
 as it begins working to take 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.869
 walk the circulation and make it flow 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.330
 the whole body and that the toxins come out 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.790
 the wonder that this habit has 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.670
 you can adopt every day and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.680
 that really 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.189
 it's something of discipline that does not require 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.659
 money requires nothing more than a brush 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.759
 then something that I really like about this 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.619
 is that it's a way to exfoliate in 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.840
 where are we helping the strong 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.970
 feel much more revitalized by more 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.340
 energy we felt like much more 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.350
 vigorous and the skin starts to see 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.780
 much softer you start to see more 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.140
 and what will happen is that everyone 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 the treatments or all the creams the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 oils the moisturizers that we use 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.289
 they will absorb much better then 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 if you make all the spices 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.729
 days will start to really notice 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.190
 extraordinary results a skin the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.890
 brushing is dry it has to be all 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.039
 the days of preference before getting 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.990
 to bathe and on dry skin the skin does not 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.690
 it must be wet it must not have 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.360
 creams should not have people should not have 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.789
 nothing the skin should be clean and dry and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.399
 we're going to work on that skin and we're going 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.140
 to brush the whole body from below 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.310
 up to that I will teach them in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.439
 just a moment 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.569
 it's something optional is that before getting 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.209
 to bathe and once they have done that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.880
 caught dry can use an oil 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.349
 to hydrate the body and I have a 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.360
 oil because I really like to put 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.790
 our little boats can be an oil 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 olive an almond oil a 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.940
 jojoba oil once it is 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.650
 they brushed the body they let the brush 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 they put the oil on the whole body and they 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 they get to bathe but this is optional 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.410
 this is not necessary what he is going to do 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.599
 is that both but a little more 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.470
 hydrated but there are some precautions 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.110
 What should I let you know if they have 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.269
 cut wounds if they have very skin 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.500
 red very sensitive and have burned 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.239
 severe sun 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 obviously do not do dry brushing 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.170
 because they are going to sign more the skin 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.060
 reiterate and it is not recommended 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.030
 so now I'm going to show you 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.470
 how is each of the steps they have 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.150
 what to do begin to do all the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.040
 days and they will see miracles in their skin 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.620
 to do your dry brushing 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.260
 started on the movements 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.689
 they must be circular and ascending in 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.180
 address to the heart is asked to all your 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.470
 body up going through the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.790
 legs calves 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.069
 the thighs the buttocks 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.970
 Do not forget the part of your abdomen and 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.910
 do it in circular motions 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.580
 you start to take care of your arms too 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 ascending movements I recommend you 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.540
 that you are brushed, do not apply it in 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.760
 your breasts since it is a very 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.010
 sensitive you will notice that your skin starts 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.690
 to put red this is just the sign of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.270
 that the blood is flowing and in the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.790
 part of the neck use your brush in 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.960
 upward movements do it all 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.960
 days before the bath 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.080
 now I am silent 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.920
 or the coast 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.920
