George Lynch and various others that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
George Lynch and various others that
kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> emulate<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> Eddie<00:00:39.480> Van<00:00:39.570> Halen's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
kind of emulate that Eddie Van Halen's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.860 
kind of emulate that Eddie Van Halen's
style<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> they're<00:00:41.700> playing<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
style and they're playing and it's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
style and they're playing and it's
basically<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> involves<00:00:43.829> random<00:00:44.160> harmonics

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
basically it involves random harmonics

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.430 
basically it involves random harmonics
while<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.449> using<00:00:45.690> while<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.230> playing

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
while you're using while you're playing

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.829 
while you're using while you're playing
legato<00:00:46.679> is<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.249> left<00:00:47.399> hand<00:00:47.670> before<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.660> show

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
legato is in the left hand before I show

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.299 
legato is in the left hand before I show
you<00:00:48.870> what's<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.739> create<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> extra

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you what's going on to create the extra

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
you what's going on to create the extra
harmonic<00:00:50.850> let's<00:00:51.420> talk<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.899> actual

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
harmonic let's talk about the actual

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
harmonic let's talk about the actual
legato<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:52.920> doing<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.730> doing<00:00:53.909> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
legato that I'm doing I'm just doing a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
legato that I'm doing I'm just doing a
repetitive<00:00:54.269> legato<00:00:54.839> lick<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
repetitive legato lick here which I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
repetitive legato lick here which I
think<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.159> repetitive<00:00:56.730> licks<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.629> ones

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
think the repetitive licks are the ones

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
think the repetitive licks are the ones
that<00:00:58.019> really<00:00:58.379> make<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.980> technique<00:00:59.399> come<00:00:59.609> out

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that really make this technique come out

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.029 
that really make this technique come out
better<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.300> allows<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.659> better

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
better because it allows you to better

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
better because it allows you to better
manipulate<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.159> sound<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> harmonics<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
manipulate the sound of the harmonics so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.290 
manipulate the sound of the harmonics so
this<00:01:04.229> look<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.710> playing<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:06.150> here

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
this look that I'm playing is down here

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.790 
this look that I'm playing is down here
at<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> second<00:01:06.720> fret<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:06.990> g<00:01:07.200> string<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
at the second fret on the g string and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.410 
at the second fret on the g string and
you're<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.340> hammer<00:01:08.550> on<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> fourth

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you're going to hammer on to the fourth

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.180 
you're going to hammer on to the fourth
fret<00:01:10.670> pull<00:01:11.670> back<00:01:11.850> off<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> second<00:01:13.190> and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
fret pull back off to the second and

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.819 
fret pull back off to the second and
we're<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> fourth<00:01:15.530> back<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
we're back on to the fourth back off to

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.980 
we're back on to the fourth back off to
the<00:01:16.860> second<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:18.180> pull<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.719> open

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the second and then pull off to the open

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:40.760 
the second and then pull off to the open
string<00:01:19.549> we<00:01:20.549> have

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100 

okay<00:01:41.759> let's<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.540> work<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
okay let's gonna get work that up to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
okay let's gonna get work that up to
speed<00:01:43.380> let's<00:01:44.220> add<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.640> harmonics<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.420> what's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
speed let's add to harmonics now what's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
speed let's add to harmonics now what's
going<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.909> my

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
going on here is what I do is is up my

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
going on here is what I do is is up my
pinky<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.080> edge<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.530> pinky<00:01:49.950> here

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
pinky I think the edge of my pinky here

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.779 
pinky I think the edge of my pinky here
it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> bit<00:01:51.770> more<00:01:52.770> sturdy<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
it's a it's a bit more sturdy the the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.940 
it's a it's a bit more sturdy the the
edge<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> fatty<00:01:55.560> fingers

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
edge of it then more the fatty fingers

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
edge of it then more the fatty fingers
on<00:01:56.070> your<00:01:56.100> hand<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.430> you'll<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:56.880> your

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
on your hand so you'll want to use your

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
on your hand so you'll want to use your
pinky<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> edge<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.340> pinky

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
pinky I just use the edge of my pinky

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.300 
pinky I just use the edge of my pinky
and<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.840> start<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.500> placing<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.039> lightly

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and I so start it by placing it lightly

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.820 
and I so start it by placing it lightly
across<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:03.000> six<00:02:03.270> strings<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:04.380> around<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
across all six strings right around the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.249 
across all six strings right around the
bridge<00:02:05.070> okay<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> first<00:02:07.080> start

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
bridge okay now when you first start

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.070 
bridge okay now when you first start
playing<00:02:07.470> this<00:02:07.799> legato<00:02:08.310> lick<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.750> notice<00:02:12.989> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
playing this legato lick you notice it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.330 
playing this legato lick you notice it
sounds<00:02:13.380> muted<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:13.980> muting<00:02:14.250> all

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
sounds muted because you're muting all

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.000 
sounds muted because you're muting all
the<00:02:14.430> strings<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.989> take<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.470> lightly

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the strings but as I take that lightly

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.340 
the strings but as I take that lightly
touching<00:02:17.610> those<00:02:17.760> strings<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> I'm<00:02:18.600> glide

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
touching those strings and I'm glide

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.180 
touching those strings and I'm glide
this<00:02:20.090> pinky<00:02:21.090> down<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.799> six<00:02:22.980> strings

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
this pinky down the all the six strings

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.580 
this pinky down the all the six strings
together<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.569> start<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.170> across

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
together it's gonna start going across

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.620 
together it's gonna start going across
notes<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.610> third<00:02:26.790> string<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.269> g<00:02:27.420> string

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
notes on that third string the g string

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.300 
notes on that third string the g string
that<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:27.900> playing<00:02:28.110> down<00:02:28.319> here<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:29.160> are

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that I'm playing down here that are

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.820 
that I'm playing down here that are
harmonic<00:02:29.850> node<00:02:30.090> points<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.350> harmonic

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
harmonic node points and those harmonic

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
harmonic node points and those harmonic
note<00:02:31.980> points<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> create<00:02:32.640> random

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
note points are going to create random

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.640 
note points are going to create random
harmonics<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.870> shift<00:02:34.110> from<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
harmonics as you shift from one to the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
harmonics as you shift from one to the
other<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.130> let<00:02:36.060> me<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.330> show<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
other so let me just show you what it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.300 
other so let me just show you what it
sounds<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.959> it'll<00:02:37.230> start<00:02:37.470> muted<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
sounds like it'll start muted but as I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.640 
sounds like it'll start muted but as I
move<00:02:38.489> down<00:02:38.519> closer<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> neck<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
move down closer to the neck the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:53.290 
move down closer to the neck the
harmonics<00:02:41.099> will<00:02:41.190> start<00:02:41.340> popping<00:02:41.489> out

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.820 

okay<00:02:54.300> now<00:02:54.810> obviously<00:02:54.990> I'm<00:02:55.380> doing<00:02:55.620> this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
okay now obviously I'm doing this

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.370 
okay now obviously I'm doing this
repetitive<00:02:56.130> lick<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.780> also<00:02:57.930> move<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
repetitive lick but you can also move to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
repetitive lick but you can also move to
the<00:02:58.470> other<00:02:58.620> strings<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:59.070> move<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.730> lyric

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the other strings they move that lyric

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.420 
the other strings they move that lyric
to<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> D<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.440> strings<00:03:02.100> while<00:03:02.310> you're

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to the D and the a strings while you're

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:17.410 
to the D and the a strings while you're
doing<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.730> be<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.600> this

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.840 

okay<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.020> different<00:03:19.800> strings<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.280> harmonics

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
okay so different strings the harmonics

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.550 
okay so different strings the harmonics
work<00:03:21.060> better<00:03:21.300> in<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:22.020> different<00:03:22.260> areas

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
work better in little different areas

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.170 
work better in little different areas
and<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:23.280> usually<00:03:23.580> getting<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.940> feel

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and it's just usually getting the feel

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.080 
and it's just usually getting the feel
of<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.319> just<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:26.130> experiment<00:03:26.790> by<00:03:26.850> moving

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
of it so just just experiment by moving

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.540 
of it so just just experiment by moving
your<00:03:27.209> pinky<00:03:27.569> back<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.020> forth<00:03:28.260> around<00:03:28.620> just

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
your pinky back and forth around just

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.949 
your pinky back and forth around just
little<00:03:29.819> sections<00:03:30.209> around<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.660> figure<00:03:30.900> out

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
little sections around and figure out

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.510 
little sections around and figure out
where<00:03:31.260> those<00:03:31.350> node<00:03:31.650> points<00:03:32.069> are<00:03:32.160> out<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.400> your

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
where those node points are out on your

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.070 
where those node points are out on your
guitar<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.330> sound<00:03:33.569> really<00:03:33.750> good<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
guitar that sound really good and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.990 
guitar that sound really good and
they're<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.410> alive<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.220> will<00:03:35.550> really<00:03:35.730> pop

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
they're really alive and will really pop

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 
they're really alive and will really pop
out<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.569> mean<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.739> really<00:03:37.980> easy

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
out I mean it's just a really easy

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.740 
out I mean it's just a really easy
technique<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:38.850> be<00:03:38.910> used<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.390> just<00:03:39.569> about

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
technique that can be used in just about

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.100 
technique that can be used in just about
any<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.520> style<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:41.970> rock<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.569> metal<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
any you know style of rock and metal and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.530 
any you know style of rock and metal and
it's<00:03:43.800> very<00:03:44.520> simple<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:44.910> understand<00:03:45.270> like<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it's very simple to understand like you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.210 
it's very simple to understand like you
said<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> do<00:03:46.080> any<00:03:46.290> kind<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.650> legato<00:03:46.980> like

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
said you can do any kind of legato like

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.250 
said you can do any kind of legato like
you<00:03:47.310> want<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.420> want<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.750> with<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.080> but

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
you want it you want you with it but

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720 
you want it you want you with it but
it's<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.500> lot<00:03:49.650> easier<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.100> get<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> harmonics

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
it's a lot easier to get the harmonics

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.670 
it's a lot easier to get the harmonics
out<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.120> manipulate<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> sound<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:52.590> you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
out to manipulate the sound when you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.199 
out to manipulate the sound when you
have<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> repetitive<00:03:53.160> figure<00:03:53.610> going<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.030> down

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
have a repetitive figure going on down

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.270 
have a repetitive figure going on down
here<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.660> then<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.140> can<00:03:55.290> hear<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> harmonics

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
here and then you can hear the harmonics

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460 
here and then you can hear the harmonics
change<00:03:56.730> even<00:03:57.420> though<00:03:57.570> nothing<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.050> changing

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
change even though nothing is changing

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.190 
change even though nothing is changing
in<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.680> left<00:03:58.890> hand<00:03:59.130> okay<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.050> fun

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
in the left hand okay so just have fun

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.479 
in the left hand okay so just have fun
with<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.410> technique<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.980> see<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.370> can

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
with this technique and see if you can

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.770 
with this technique and see if you can
throw<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.790> into<00:04:02.910> your<00:04:03.060> playing<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.450> little<00:04:03.569> bit

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
throw it into your playing a little bit

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.500 
throw it into your playing a little bit
it's<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:05.040> technique<00:04:05.640> used<00:04:05.880> by<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.030> lot<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.360> famous

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
it's a technique used by a lot of famous

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.449 
it's a technique used by a lot of famous
guitar<00:04:06.900> players<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.769> next<00:04:07.980> time<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.310> hear

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
guitar players and so next time you hear

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.250 
guitar players and so next time you hear
it<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.670> recording<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.810> don't<00:04:09.959> know<00:04:10.080> what
