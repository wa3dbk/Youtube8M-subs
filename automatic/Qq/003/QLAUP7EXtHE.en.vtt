00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.549
 good morning to all the boys and girls 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.499
 then video with the first mi of for 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:15.869
 show you how the shirt works 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:18.720
 straight then how does the 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.910
 machine to make the flat knit 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.519
 sorry but I think I'm fighting 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 the flu is also what I say not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 know sometimes it doesn't make sense then I had 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.350
 made a video last year on the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.040
 shirt is straight and I had it in practice 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 done 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 I had done the video with the first maxi 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.040
 now this year many of you have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.740
 bought the first midi and they have me 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.540
 asked to make a video you see that 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.340
 maybe with that video they are not found 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:00.390
 and then decided to satisfy you then 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.930
 nothing you simply have to put the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.660
 selector but we'll talk about it later why 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.660
 initially we have to turn prospects 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.920
 because I don't know why I've already threaded it 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:20.700
 the thread I do not know what to do then double 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.360
 so plan we have to have to if this 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.360
 it goes like this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.040
 then we do something because it is from a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.390
 since I don't remember why 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.210
 try again the selector with it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:46.619
 let 's see where you find the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:49.020
 square ok perfect we slip in the ne 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:56.420
 let's put a little because we'll need it later 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 close and now we go as usual a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 insert the thread with the shirt itself is a 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.220
 magliano so the hook will the red 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:16.200
 noble white hook white object yes 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:18.980
 no and let's go on like this until the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.980
 our car 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 ok see the machine crashes 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.760
 automatically then there is to say one 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.880
 thing 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.670
 the first two three points to the machine there 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.700
 will lose automatically ie now when 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 I will return the car back to me 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:04.610
 will lose points but nothing that is 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:09.049
 normal then I do the tour now 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.890
 otherwise you see I leave now 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.280
 what are you waiting for zumbo maybe you can 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.280
 to see 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:26.000
 ok you see that now I let the thread 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.780
 go under all the hooks I repeat the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.540
 work with the first is a job is co 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.450
 you see it is blocked by itself is a job 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.180
 of patience girls but a job of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.730
 patience for the first two or three laps then 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.410
 the machine does everything by itself if you 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.130
 you have patience 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.090
 the first two or three turns so that the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.940
 machine 30 points well then it is 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.519
 that is a health walk indeed 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.900
 make the shirts then I give you an advice 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.709
 when now 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.319
 we will share you will have to wait for that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.269
 I make mistakes so I make you 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.519
 see what I do in this way or from it 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:17.530
 part 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:20.380
 if I can ok, put your hand inside e 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:25.810
 take out the thread so that it is the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:36.360
 your thread will be waiting there you are 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:38.169
 then considering that I'm here now 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.820
 slowly 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:46.960
 let the machine take the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:51.220
 wool and Syrians will block by itself 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.760
 new thread also pull this thread e 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.760
 I go ahead 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:04.810
 and then again you see how it grows 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.810
 but work as I have already told you 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.080
 wait until I shoot so at least I do 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.090
 see better is you see the bridges like 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.610
 he took them well 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:22.530
 no you don't see it so if you put a 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:27.060
 fire I would also be much happier though 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.060
 ok and let's go on like this 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:46.889
 ok girls what to say this is the start of the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:50.499
 work ie there is nothing else to say 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.020
 if not because I now have to take it off 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:59.430
 how the work is slipped away, actually 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:02.909
 I show you at least so you can 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:08.520
 play in the area that goes quietly 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:10.779
 and I go for a moment to take the 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.469
 crochet so I show you how 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.469
 it slips away
