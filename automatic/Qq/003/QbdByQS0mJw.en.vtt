00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
making sure it worked this morning when

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.120 
making sure it worked this morning when
I<00:01:46.590> signed<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:49.350> glitch<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> lot

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I signed on and this glitch is a lot

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
I signed on and this glitch is a lot
easier<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.759> than<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> break<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> block

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
easier to do than the break the block

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
easier to do than the break the block
pick<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> block<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.340> find<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
pick up the block one I find that it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
pick up the block one I find that it
does<00:01:54.420> work<00:01:54.689> yes<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.619> hard<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> do

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
does work yes but it's really hard to do

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
does work yes but it's really hard to do

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
one works a lot faster so we'll leave

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.069 
one works a lot faster so we'll leave
that<00:01:59.729> xx<00:02:00.090> block<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.509> without

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that xx block right here without

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.420 
that xx block right here without
touching<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.590> we'll<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.740> work<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
touching but we'll just work with this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.789 
touching but we'll just work with this
two<00:02:02.729> block<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.149> diamonds<00:02:03.570> right<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:03.930> so

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
two block of diamonds right here so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490 
two block of diamonds right here so
basically<00:02:05.189> we're<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.520> pick<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.939> up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
basically we're gonna pick it up

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
basically we're gonna pick it up
we're<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.129> over<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.550> here<00:02:08.879> we're<00:02:09.330> gonna

we're gonna go over up here we're gonna

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.280 
we're gonna go over up here we're gonna
put<00:02:09.690> half<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:11.750> then<00:02:12.750> we're<00:02:12.930> gonna<00:02:12.989> put

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
put half of it down then we're gonna put

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.369 
put half of it down then we're gonna put
this<00:02:13.440> one<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.190> X<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.019> now<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.080> press

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
this one down with X and now you press

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.750 
this one down with X and now you press
triangle<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.069> send<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.400> up

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
triangle to send it up

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300 
triangle to send it up
notice<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.569> block<00:02:18.870> stays<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.830> not

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
notice how the block stays there and not

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
notice how the block stays there and not
up<00:02:20.459> here<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.879> what<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.239> do<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
up here so what I'm gonna do here is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.120 
up here so what I'm gonna do here is
again<00:02:22.519> take<00:02:23.519> half<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.420> square

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
again take half of it with the square

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.100 
again take half of it with the square
put<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.670> X<00:02:26.849> hit<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> triangle

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
put it down with the X hit the triangle

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.930 
put it down with the X hit the triangle
and<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> again<00:02:30.440> half<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.769> down<00:02:32.130> triangle

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and do it again half of it down triangle

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.580 
and do it again half of it down triangle
and<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.299> find<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.810> works<00:02:34.019> really<00:02:34.290> fast

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and I find that this works really fast

diamonds so what we do is we get out of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.780 
diamonds so what we do is we get out of
this<00:03:03.599> screen<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.890> our<00:03:05.099> other<00:03:05.280> crafting

screen the basic one we go over to our

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.699 
screen the basic one we go over to our
diamonds<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.299> look<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.319> get<00:03:10.500> nine

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
diamonds and look at that we get nine

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.009 
diamonds and look at that we get nine
diamonds<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.310> each<00:03:11.430> block<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> let's<00:03:12.540> hammer

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you'll notice my other blocks went

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.849 
you'll notice my other blocks went
through<00:03:20.609> as<00:03:20.760> well<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.600> said<00:03:22.139> including

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
through as well but that said including

through as well but that said including
the<00:03:23.250> seven<00:03:23.819> blocks<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.269> did<00:03:24.540> there<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:25.380> now

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
the seven blocks that I did there we now

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.449 
the seven blocks that I did there we now
have<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:26.130> ton<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.510> diamonds<00:03:28.160> these<00:03:29.160> diamonds

have a ton of diamonds these diamonds

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.599 
have a ton of diamonds these diamonds
can<00:03:29.819> be<00:03:29.940> used<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.299> make<00:03:30.480> weapons<00:03:31.350> pigs<00:03:31.980> axes

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609
