actually he lost the nuke though is he

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.680 
actually he lost the nuke though is he
gonna<00:03:39.100> try<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.400> rebuild<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.820> probably<00:03:40.359> not<00:03:40.480> he

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
gonna try and rebuild it probably not he

so<00:05:54.889> that<00:05:55.010> he<00:05:55.099> had<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.310> advantage<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:55.880> if

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
so that he had the advantage so if

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.010 
so that he had the advantage so if
generals<00:05:58.669> Vikings<00:05:59.060> had<00:05:59.210> survived<00:05:59.510> instead<00:05:59.900> if

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
he'd had if he gotten the advantage

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.560 
he'd had if he gotten the advantage
there<00:06:01.729> he<00:06:01.849> could<00:06:01.970> have<00:06:02.060> picked<00:06:02.150> off<00:06:02.360> these

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
there he could have picked off these

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.409 
there he could have picked off these
drop<00:06:02.780> ships<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.729> Raven<00:06:05.150> and

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
drop ships and and the and the Raven and

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.000 
drop ships and and the and the Raven and
would<00:06:05.960> have<00:06:06.050> had<00:06:06.169> much<00:06:06.349> more<00:06:06.380> of<00:06:06.650> an<00:06:06.740> advantage

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
would have had much more of an advantage

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
would have had much more of an advantage
it<00:06:07.190> would<00:06:07.280> have<00:06:07.370> been<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.490> much<00:06:07.550> more<00:06:07.820> even

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
it would have been a much more even

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.000 
it would have been a much more even
match

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010
