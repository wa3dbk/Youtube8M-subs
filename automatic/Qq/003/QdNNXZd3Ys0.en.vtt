00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello everyone, if you are not invited unexpectedly 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.550
 came to visit and you unfortunately do not have 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.519
 there is nothing rock and I offer you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 make a cake in two minutes very 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.320
 delicious cakes for this you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 need 4 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.980
 baking powder dough 3 tablespoons 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 cocoa 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 powdered sugar 2 tablespoons and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.930
 book Well, let's start milk 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 should be warm as in warm 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.579
 milk is best split times do not look 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.640
 No, therefore, to warm up exactly what does not 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:44.450
 need to give them a boil but by the way 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:47.890
 still need to pray for sure 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.890
 beat egg milk 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.800
 whip everything 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 add powdered sugar 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.090
 generally need 3 tablespoons I will add 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.090
 I mean that I do not really like sweet 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.479
 again we mix everything thoroughly 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.510
 why add powdered sugar because 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 that it more dissolves better and tastes 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.890
 more or less it seems 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:46.440
 then add to to to need 2 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.680
 big tablespoons if you spoon 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.420
 small passed three 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.280
 there are dessert spoons did not drop 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.780
 dream then I will need to be with me 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.590
 the canteen, although everything is already whipped 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 dough is obtained well as a thick sour cream 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 but it still has to be future because 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.680
 that we will add more flour here 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.870
 before flour I always add 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.170
 baking powder dough why baking powder 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.659
 because soda gives taste 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.120
 that's exactly soda, so I like it better 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:38.299
 when the baking powder I add somewhere 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.579
 about a teaspoon when they 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.000
 Rise lush Thai very 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.000
 delicious 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.080
 but 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.219
 if your girlfriends came for a conversation 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.090
 you can easily do literally 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.819
 5 minutes 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:07.290
 such beautiful road we now 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.290
 flour we add 3 tablespoons 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.730
 again if dessert spoons 104 I 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.730
 add 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.900
 and all stir the dough became 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.900
 so thick 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.320
 About molds can be absolutely 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.350
 you can even bake any 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.390
 mugs with ordinary mugs tea coffee and 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.840
 tea is a big profit itself is 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.840
 put down 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.290
 if you're still on so here is a little fork 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.460
 whisk them comfortable 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.850
 I have these tins 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.600
 I already smeared them with oil 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:35.890
 Here on here two such forms goes 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.890
 all the dough is divide the dough in half 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.090
 na 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:50.269
 the cake is actually very tasty and 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.999
 very chocolate besides you can 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:55.099
 if you have of course time or you 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:58.279
 maybe just doing for yourself 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.360
 dessert can even be used 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:06.169
 some cream 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:08.679
 while I'm with him without the cream fails to 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.679
 to the text 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.680
 So 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.460
 all steel in the microwave for 2 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.460
 minutes
