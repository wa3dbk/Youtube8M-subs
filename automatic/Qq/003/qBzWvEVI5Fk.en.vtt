vern<00:00:08.429> Krauss<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.510> hope<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.290> pronouncing<00:00:10.320> that

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
vern Krauss I hope I'm pronouncing that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.120 
vern Krauss I hope I'm pronouncing that
right<00:00:11.160> Vern<00:00:11.840> from<00:00:12.840> Laughlin<00:00:13.320> Nevada<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
right Vern from Laughlin Nevada one of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.700 
right Vern from Laughlin Nevada one of
my<00:00:14.219> favorite<00:00:14.580> towns<00:00:15.170> what<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
my favorite towns what could be the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
my favorite towns what could be the
possible<00:00:17.160> reason<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.550> interior<00:00:18.330> lights

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
possible reason for interior lights

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320 
possible reason for interior lights
ceiling<00:00:19.380> reading<00:00:19.920> etc<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.820> come<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.150> by

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
ceiling reading etc to come on by

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.410 
ceiling reading etc to come on by
themselves<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:23.070> using<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.670> switch<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.240> do

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
themselves and not using a switch to do

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140 
themselves and not using a switch to do
so<00:00:24.689> could<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.740> bad<00:00:25.949> switch<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.760> far<00:00:26.970> there

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so could it be a bad switch so far there

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
so could it be a bad switch so far there
are<00:00:27.269> three<00:00:27.570> banks<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.109> lights<00:00:28.349> involved<00:00:29.189> yeah

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
are three banks of lights involved yeah

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
are three banks of lights involved yeah
that's<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:31.109> not<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> good<00:00:31.800> situation

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that's not a that's not a good situation

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
that's not a that's not a good situation
there<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.030> does<00:00:33.239> mean<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> something

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
there that it does mean that something

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000 
there that it does mean that something
is<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.510> operating<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:37.230> operating

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
is not operating or operating

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.790 
is not operating or operating
intermittently<00:00:38.700> Vern<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.629> chances<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
intermittently Vern and chances are it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
intermittently Vern and chances are it
is<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> switching<00:00:41.879> mechanism<00:00:42.140> now<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
is in the switching mechanism now you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 
is in the switching mechanism now you
have<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> also<00:00:43.739> remember<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> those

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
have to also remember that some of those

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.330 
have to also remember that some of those
panels<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.660> lamps<00:00:46.170> panels<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.770> lights<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
panels of lamps panels of lights if you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.020 
panels of lamps panels of lights if you
will<00:00:47.640> maybe<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.579> through<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.730> they<00:00:50.820> call<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
will maybe on a through what they call a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
will maybe on a through what they call a
three-way<00:00:51.539> switch<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.110> other<00:00:52.260> words<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
three-way switch in other words you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.439 
three-way switch in other words you
might<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.309> able<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> turn<00:00:53.699> those<00:00:53.940> lights<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
might be able to turn those lights on

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
might be able to turn those lights on
from<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.170> switch<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.100> inside<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> entry<00:00:57.000> door

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
from a switch just inside the entry door

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
from a switch just inside the entry door
and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> also<00:00:58.170> may<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.530> able<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> turn

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and then you also may be able to turn

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
and then you also may be able to turn
those<00:00:59.250> lamps<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.989> same<00:01:01.230> Bank<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
those lamps on in that same Bank of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
those lamps on in that same Bank of
lamps<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.280> another<00:01:02.609> location<00:01:02.969> inside<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
lamps from another location inside the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
lamps from another location inside the
RV<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> could<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.369> shorted<00:01:05.909> wiring<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
RV so it could be a shorted wiring in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.050 
RV so it could be a shorted wiring in
the<00:01:06.750> switch<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:08.220> pull<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.580> both<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the switch I would pull out both of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
the switch I would pull out both of
those<00:01:09.390> switches<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> switch<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
those switches or the switch that you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
those switches or the switch that you
you<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.520> concerned<00:01:11.880> about<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.510> make

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you that you're concerned about and make

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
you that you're concerned about and make
sure<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.500> none<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> contacts<00:01:14.549> are

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
sure that none of the contacts are

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
sure that none of the contacts are
touching<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.170> another<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> switch<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
touching one another when that switch is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
touching one another when that switch is
installed<00:01:17.659> here's<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.869> I've<00:01:18.990> seen<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
light circuit switch so what you're

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
light circuit switch so what you're
doing<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> shorting<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.470> connection

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
doing is shorting out the connection

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
doing is shorting out the connection
between<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.670> hot<00:01:56.850> wire<00:01:57.030> coming<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> then

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
between the hot wire coming in and then

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
between the hot wire coming in and then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the wire going to those lamps so it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
the wire going to those lamps so it's
not<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> dangerous<00:02:01.740> situation<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> be

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
not a dangerous situation it can be

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
not a dangerous situation it can be
irritating<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> lights<00:02:03.659> keep<00:02:03.869> flashing

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
irritating when the lights keep flashing

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.620 
irritating when the lights keep flashing
on<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.430> pull<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.759> switch<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.329> from

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
on so I would pull that switch out from

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
on so I would pull that switch out from
the<00:02:06.750> wall<00:02:06.930> wherever<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.560> mounted<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> if

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the wall wherever it's mounted and if

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.130 
the wall wherever it's mounted and if
you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.819> two<00:02:09.030> switches<00:02:09.179> make<00:02:09.660> sure<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.929> pull

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you have two switches make sure you pull

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
you have two switches make sure you pull
them<00:02:10.289> both<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.550> both<00:02:11.730> could<00:02:12.030> be

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
them both out because they both could be

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
them both out because they both could be
affecting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
affecting

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
affecting
you<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.250> current<00:02:14.670> being<00:02:14.850> transferred

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you know that current being transferred

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.210 
you know that current being transferred
through<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.750> switch<00:02:16.080> I'm<00:02:16.560> guessing<00:02:17.130> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
through that switch I'm guessing that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.890 
through that switch I'm guessing that
it's<00:02:17.370> probably<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.090> real<00:02:18.270> tight-fitting

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it's probably just a real tight-fitting

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's probably just a real tight-fitting
switch<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.890> enough<00:02:20.160> room<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
switch not enough room at the back of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.280 
switch not enough room at the back of
the<00:02:21.090> switch<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.510> we're<00:02:21.780> bending<00:02:21.990> those

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the switch and we're bending those

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
the switch and we're bending those
prongs<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.610> where<00:02:23.730> we're<00:02:23.850> actually

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
prongs down to where we're actually

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.420 
prongs down to where we're actually
making<00:02:24.360> contact<00:02:25.110> between<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.710> hot<00:02:25.860> wire<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
making contact between the hot wire and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.790 
making contact between the hot wire and
the<00:02:26.790> wire<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> switch<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> pull

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the wire going to the switch so I pull

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.590 
the wire going to the switch so I pull
those<00:02:28.980> pull<00:02:29.550> those<00:02:29.700> fuses<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.240> pull<00:02:30.450> those

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
those pull those fuses there pull those

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690 
those pull those fuses there pull those
switches<00:02:30.990> down<00:02:31.200> if<00:02:31.590> there's<00:02:32.070> plenty<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.460> room

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
switches down if there's plenty of room

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760 
switches down if there's plenty of room
back<00:02:32.910> there<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:33.930> try<00:02:34.170> another<00:02:34.470> switch

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
back there I would try another switch

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.920 
back there I would try another switch
just<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> problem<00:02:36.120> still<00:02:36.150> exists

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
just to see if the problem still exists

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.230 
just to see if the problem still exists
if<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.380> problem<00:02:37.800> goes<00:02:37.980> away<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.060> know

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
if the problem goes away then you know

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.650 
if the problem goes away then you know
it<00:02:39.390> was<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.050> switch<00:02:40.260> itself
