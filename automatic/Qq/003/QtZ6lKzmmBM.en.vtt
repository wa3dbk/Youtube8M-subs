to do i really enjoy uploading daily so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029 
to do i really enjoy uploading daily so
that<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.000> why<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:28.109> uploads<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.680> been<00:00:28.830> like

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that is why my uploads have been like

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.859 
that is why my uploads have been like
every<00:00:29.250> other<00:00:29.460> day<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:29.699> every<00:00:29.820> two<00:00:30.090> days<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
every other day or every two days and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.340 
every other day or every two days and
the<00:00:31.619> reason<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:33.059> am<00:00:33.420> moving<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the reason is because i am moving and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
the reason is because i am moving and
i'm<00:00:34.770> moving<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.820> house<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.809> has<00:00:36.930> been<00:00:37.079> in

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
i'm moving from a house that has been in

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.639 
i'm moving from a house that has been in
my<00:00:37.200> family<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:38.100> 23<00:00:38.910> years<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:40.020> 23

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
my family for 23 years so that's 23

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.280 
my family for 23 years so that's 23
years<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> stuff<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.390> house<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.170> we're

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
years of stuff in a house and we're

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
years of stuff in a house and we're
moving<00:00:43.649> into<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.950> rental<00:00:44.040> property<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
moving into a rental property that is a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
moving into a rental property that is a
lot<00:00:46.200> smaller<00:00:46.500> than<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> house<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.309> i<00:00:47.340> have

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
lot smaller than the house that i have

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
lot smaller than the house that i have

so<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> stressful<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.299> that's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so that was kind of stressful so that's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
so that was kind of stressful so that's
just<00:01:36.509> what<00:01:36.720> I've<00:01:36.810> been<00:01:36.930> dealing<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
just what I've been dealing with for the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
just what I've been dealing with for the
past<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> month<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:39.090> something<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
past like month or something like that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.740

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
getting ready to move and everything

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
getting ready to move and everything
should<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.619> terms<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.040> internet

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
should be good in terms of internet
because<00:01:44.729> we've<00:01:44.939> actually<00:01:45.119> arranged<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
of his stitches so that has been really

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960 
of his stitches so that has been really
challenging<00:03:51.160> because<00:03:52.160> he<00:03:52.490> doesn't<00:03:52.670> want<00:03:52.820> to

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
challenging because he doesn't want to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.750 
challenging because he doesn't want to
be<00:03:53.090> inside<00:03:53.420> he<00:03:54.110> wants<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.800> go<00:03:55.220> outside<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
be inside he wants to go outside and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.730 
be inside he wants to go outside and
explore<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.510> do<00:03:56.660> all<00:03:56.780> crazy<00:03:57.140> things<00:03:57.560> but

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
explore and do all crazy things but

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.070 
explore and do all crazy things but
obviously<00:03:58.160> he<00:03:58.310> can't<00:03:58.490> do<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.780> looking

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
obviously he can't do that so looking

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080 
obviously he can't do that so looking
after<00:04:00.350> device<00:04:00.620> has<00:04:00.860> been<00:04:01.040> super<00:04:01.520> challenging
