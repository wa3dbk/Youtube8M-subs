00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
mineral low or throw because they you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.220 
mineral low or throw because they you
really<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.050> mixed<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.400> he's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.810> fast

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
really get mixed up but he's not as fast

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.100

as<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.399> other<00:00:32.430> characters<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> game<00:00:36.110> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
as the other characters in the game so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
as the other characters in the game so
this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> basic<00:00:37.920> beat<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.820> hold<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> he

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this is a basic beat but if I hold it he

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170 
this is a basic beat but if I hold it he
comes<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> time<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:42.149> i

comes out and if I time it right what i

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.500 
comes out and if I time it right what i
can<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> combo
