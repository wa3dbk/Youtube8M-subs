00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to say that it's the stereotype is just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
to say that it's the stereotype is just
to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> fast<00:01:12.840> okay<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.780> think<00:01:15.780> when

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to do it fast okay but I think when

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.300 
to do it fast okay but I think when
people<00:01:15.990> start<00:01:16.619> making<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> film<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:18.030> full

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
people start making a film about a full

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.530 
people start making a film about a full
full<00:01:20.310> character<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.880> mean<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
full character I mean it's not just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
full character I mean it's not just
coming<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.080> between<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:23.100> Sehun<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.880> when

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
coming in between like Sehun was when

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420 
coming in between like Sehun was when
current<00:01:24.420> decided<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.409> logic<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.250> could

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
current decided my logic was and I could

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.179 
current decided my logic was and I could
be<00:01:26.549> wrong<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:29.070> have

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
be wrong because I'm not a I don't have

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
be wrong because I'm not a I don't have
full<00:01:29.340> knowledge<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.729> Islam<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:30.270> being<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
full knowledge of Islam or being a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649

Muslim<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> honest<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.210> logic<00:01:33.509> was

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
Muslim to be honest but the logic was

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.319 
Muslim to be honest but the logic was
that<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.470> play<00:01:34.680> him<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.430> play<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.939> hero

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that can we play him like we play a hero

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.990 
that can we play him like we play a hero
we<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.439> need<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.890> play<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.310> religious<00:01:38.729> part

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
we don't need to play the religious part

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
we don't need to play the religious part
of<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.869> hero<00:01:40.110> let<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.009> absolutely

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of him as the hero let it be absolutely

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.719 
of him as the hero let it be absolutely
normal<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> Muslim<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:44.490> don't

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
normal because I'm a Muslim and I don't

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.700 
normal because I'm a Muslim and I don't
wear<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.210> any<00:01:45.509> other<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.680> a

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
truly start breaking away for a

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.250 
truly start breaking away for a
stereotype<00:05:26.950> but<00:05:27.250> Alec<00:05:28.240> if<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.480> can<00:05:28.690> ask<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:29.050> is

there<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.500> problem<00:05:29.800> with<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.220> formulation

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
there a problem with that formulation

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.720 
there a problem with that formulation
because<00:05:31.560> somehow<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.920> way<00:05:33.040> we<00:05:33.250> all<00:05:33.370> think

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
because somehow in the way we all think

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.220 
because somehow in the way we all think
you're<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.540> liberal<00:05:34.900> Muslim<00:05:36.510> almost<00:05:37.510> only<00:05:37.840> if

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
you're a liberal Muslim almost only if

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.170 
you're a liberal Muslim almost only if
you're<00:05:38.620> non-religious<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.700> moment<00:05:40.090> you

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
you're non-religious and the moment you

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.450 
you're non-religious and the moment you
say<00:05:40.420> when<00:05:41.230> a<00:05:41.260> mass<00:05:41.470> vodka<00:05:41.860> who<00:05:42.010> you're

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
say when a mass vodka who you're

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.130 
say when a mass vodka who you're
immediately<00:05:42.820> branded<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.570> conservative

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
immediately branded a conservative

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.560 
immediately branded a conservative
almost<00:05:44.440> a<00:05:44.920> fundamentalist<00:05:45.520> yeah<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.360> then

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
almost a fundamentalist yeah and then

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.560 
almost a fundamentalist yeah and then
the<00:05:46.690> problem<00:05:47.140> is<00:05:47.320> that<00:05:47.650> I<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:47.980> Islam<00:05:48.130> is

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
the problem is that I think Islam is

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.530 
the problem is that I think Islam is
misunderstood<00:05:49.570> and<00:05:50.610> two<00:05:51.610> years<00:05:51.850> ago<00:05:52.150> in<00:05:52.360> fact
