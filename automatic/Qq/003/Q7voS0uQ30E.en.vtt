00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:14.060
 In this edition of League TV, the finishing of the facades from solid oak, open pores, patina, is an affordable and easy-to-wear finish. 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:24.540
 The League presents: oak facade finish with a patina with Yaroslav Penjola - LIGA Chief Technologist 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.400
 The first operation we need to perform is grinding with 180 grain. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.000
 The facade is ready to apply the stain and the first layer of soil. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 Renner FL25 M306 self-priming lacquer with standard hardener Renner FCM 001. It is very well suited for finishing facades, wall panels and other furniture elements. 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:17.860
 We applied the stain, applied the first layer of Renner FL25 M306 self-priming lacquer, dried for 1 hour and are now starting to polish. 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.580
 Grinding we will produce grain 320. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.940
 The facade is ready for patina. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.380
 Patina applied with a dry torch in 4 passes crosswise. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:02:00.060
 We applied a Renner GMM 048 C10 patina with a dilution of Renner DTM 070 in a ratio of 1 to 5. We applied a patina with a dry torch, and now we will clean the surplus patina with a sanding block and scotch tape. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.080
 The facades are ready, we have cleaned off the excess patina, and then we will apply a finishing coat of varnish. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.220
 We apply Renner FL25 M306, it is a varnish, it is a primer. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.360
 Summing up the resume 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:50.340
 So, the facades are made of solid oak, open porous finish simple in technical terms. 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 Self-priming lacquer Renner FL25 M306 was used, it is also ground, it is also lacquer. And one type of patina Renner GMM048 C23. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.760
 It is very light in technical terms, and the appearance is very presentable, the look of the finish. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.300
