it's important to note that these

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
cancer happening but what they do do is

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.039 
cancer happening but what they do do is
identify<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.590> cancer<00:02:16.100> early<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:17.690> believe

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
identify the cancer early and we believe

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.110 
identify the cancer early and we believe
that<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.380> means<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.010> more<00:02:19.819> easily

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that that means it is more easily

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.259 
that that means it is more easily
treated<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> concept<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.700> early

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
treated so the concept of early

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.380 
treated so the concept of early
detection<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:24.080> cancer<00:02:24.970> causing<00:02:25.970> better

cancer risk apart from stopping smoking
there<00:02:58.920> are<00:02:59.040> very<00:02:59.250> few<00:02:59.400> things<00:02:59.610> which<00:03:00.060> reduce

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
there are very few things which reduce

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.960 
there are very few things which reduce
for<00:03:00.630> example<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.110> risk<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.440> breast<00:03:01.650> cancer

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
for example the risk of breast cancer

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.790 
for example the risk of breast cancer
now<00:03:02.970> there<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.210> very<00:03:03.840> active<00:03:04.110> research

interviews<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.690> I<00:05:47.840> think<00:05:48.080> would<00:05:48.200> be<00:05:48.350> very

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
interviews and I think would be very

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.400 
interviews and I think would be very
difficult<00:05:49.310> for<00:05:49.850> employers<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.660> actually

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
difficult for employers to actually

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.250 
difficult for employers to actually
understand<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.280> information<00:05:52.940> received

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
understand the information received

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.010 
understand the information received
should<00:05:54.260> they<00:05:54.410> start<00:05:54.680> asking<00:05:54.890> such<00:05:55.310> questions

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
should they start asking such questions

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.659 
should they start asking such questions
we<00:05:57.020> would<00:05:57.110> of<00:05:57.260> course<00:05:57.440> be<00:05:57.500> very<00:05:57.890> interested<00:05:58.640> to

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
we would of course be very interested to

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.360 
we would of course be very interested to
know<00:05:59.000> if<00:05:59.470> employers<00:06:00.470> are<00:06:00.770> starting<00:06:01.250> asking

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.700 
know if employers are starting asking
these<00:06:01.700> type<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.000> questions<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:03.350> think<00:06:03.560> if

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
these type of questions and I think if

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.470 
these type of questions and I think if
that<00:06:03.740> were<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.010> case<00:06:04.100> that<00:06:04.340> cancer<00:06:05.030> backup

that were the case that cancer backup
would<00:06:05.660> certainly<00:06:06.110> put<00:06:06.890> in<00:06:07.070> place<00:06:07.370> some<00:06:07.669> work

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
would certainly put in place some work

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:18.180 
would certainly put in place some work
to<00:06:08.300> try<00:06:08.540> and<00:06:08.570> clarify<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.320> position

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.910 

once<00:06:19.190> we've<00:06:19.400> identified<00:06:19.520> a<00:06:20.210> faulty<00:06:20.720> gene<00:06:20.990> in<00:06:21.350> a

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
once we've identified a faulty gene in a

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.110 
once we've identified a faulty gene in a
family<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:23.900> can<00:06:24.080> then<00:06:24.260> test<00:06:24.970> individuals<00:06:25.970> in

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
family we can then test individuals in

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.770 
family we can then test individuals in
the<00:06:26.210> family<00:06:26.630> for<00:06:26.660> that<00:06:27.140> for<00:06:27.410> 2g

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
the family for that for 2g

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.870 
the family for that for 2g
once<00:06:29.440> you've<00:06:29.620> identified<00:06:29.680> the<00:06:30.280> voltage<00:06:30.700> in

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880

and<00:06:31.150> can<00:06:31.360> offer<00:06:31.510> testing<00:06:32.170> it<00:06:32.740> is<00:06:32.920> clear<00:06:33.430> that

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
and can offer testing it is clear that

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.740 
and can offer testing it is clear that
the<00:06:34.180> gene<00:06:35.110> the<00:06:35.620> faulty<00:06:36.070> gene<00:06:36.310> does<00:06:36.580> not<00:06:36.970> skip

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
the gene the faulty gene does not skip

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.690 
the gene the faulty gene does not skip
generations<00:06:39.750> however<00:06:40.770> people<00:06:41.770> can<00:06:42.130> carry<00:06:42.400> the

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
generations however people can carry the

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.270 
generations however people can carry the
faulty<00:06:43.090> gene<00:06:43.330> and<00:06:43.540> not<00:06:43.990> develop<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:44.740> cancer

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
faulty gene and not develop the cancer

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.720 
faulty gene and not develop the cancer
and<00:06:45.930> therefore<00:06:46.930> it<00:06:47.080> appears<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.950> the<00:06:48.280> observer

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
and therefore it appears to the observer

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.230 
and therefore it appears to the observer
as<00:06:49.150> if<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.080> cancer<00:06:50.500> has<00:06:50.860> skipped<00:06:51.490> generations

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
as if the cancer has skipped generations

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.800 
as if the cancer has skipped generations
the<00:06:53.200> faulty<00:06:53.710> gene<00:06:54.040> does<00:06:54.310> not<00:06:54.520> skip<00:06:54.880> but<00:06:55.690> the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
the faulty gene does not skip but the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.950 
the faulty gene does not skip but the
apparent<00:06:56.350> cancer<00:06:56.980> does<00:06:57.220> skip<00:06:57.550> and<00:06:57.940> we<00:06:58.750> see

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
apparent cancer does skip and we see

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.159 
apparent cancer does skip and we see
this<00:06:59.020> particularly<00:06:59.919> in<00:07:00.660> families<00:07:01.660> in<00:07:01.870> which

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
this particularly in families in which

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.700 
this particularly in families in which
breast<00:07:02.650> cancer<00:07:03.340> is<00:07:03.550> common<00:07:04.060> and<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.900> meal<00:07:05.320> or<00:07:05.590> a

breast cancer is common and a meal or a

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
man carries the faulty gene he often

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.500 
man carries the faulty gene he often
does<00:07:08.800> not<00:07:09.040> develop<00:07:09.370> any<00:07:09.640> disease<00:07:10.120> but<00:07:10.360> then

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
does not develop any disease but then

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.170 
does not develop any disease but then
when<00:07:10.750> his<00:07:10.900> daughter<00:07:11.320> gets<00:07:12.280> older<00:07:12.820> she

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
when his daughter gets older she

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.200 
when his daughter gets older she
develops<00:07:13.570> breast<00:07:13.840> cancer<00:07:14.520> now<00:07:15.520> the<00:07:15.880> breast

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
develops breast cancer now the breast

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.670

cancer<00:07:16.660> appears<00:07:17.050> to<00:07:17.290> have<00:07:17.350> skipped

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
cancer appears to have skipped

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.070 
cancer appears to have skipped
generation<00:07:18.370> but<00:07:18.940> of<00:07:19.030> course<00:07:19.270> the<00:07:19.419> faulty<00:07:19.810> gene

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.750 
generation but of course the faulty gene
has<00:07:20.350> come<00:07:20.590> through<00:07:20.830> the<00:07:20.919> man<00:07:21.130> and<00:07:21.430> therefore
