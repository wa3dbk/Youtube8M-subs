menu<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> activate<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.369> yeah<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.420> pretty

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
menu to activate it so yeah it's pretty

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.120 
menu to activate it so yeah it's pretty
tricky<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.260> done<00:00:19.470> reason<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.770> knew<00:00:19.949> how<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
tricky and done reason I knew how to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.679 
tricky and done reason I knew how to
activate<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> found<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
activate it was because I found the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
activate it was because I found the
entrance<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.170> long<00:00:22.470> before<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.980> DLC<00:00:23.400> was

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
