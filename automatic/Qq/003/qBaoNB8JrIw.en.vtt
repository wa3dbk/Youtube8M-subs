00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.920
 in the dakar 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.469
 although a car every time I start a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.469
 career that feels 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.350
 happens on the ramp by robbie gordon 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 I was doing agenda 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.799
 hop skip and people asking him to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 do what of all the years 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.440
 there is little space the ramp does not go down 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 way is parallel no no that there is a 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.090
 small cure the cars can take 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.310
 race to do the jump all the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.440
 years robbie gordon has jumped on the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.950
 ramp we have a more closed curve 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.990
 it's not the same as previous years and there goes 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.560
 I want to talk not to want it 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 suspense 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.810
 he did it he was not as spectacular as 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.940
 in other years he took care a little bit but 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.010
 robbie gordon could give show to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140
 the people here in rosario 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.980
 because more moderate he knew that there was no 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.980
 a lot of occupation 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.540
