fastest frame rate with continuous

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270 
fastest frame rate with continuous
autofocus<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.770> market<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.100> now

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
autofocus on the market right now

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180 
autofocus on the market right now
because<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> has<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> same<00:00:45.809> xp3<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.500> processor

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
because it has the same xp3 a processor

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
because it has the same xp3 a processor
as<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.760> v2<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.809> able<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.559> slow<00:00:49.890> view

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
as the v2 it's also able to do slow view

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.400 
as the v2 it's also able to do slow view
which<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> feature<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> previously

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
which was a feature that previously

which was a feature that previously
wasn't<00:00:52.890> available<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> j<00:00:53.879> cameras<00:00:54.469> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
wasn't available on the j cameras so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.150 
wasn't available on the j cameras so
basically<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.010> press<00:00:59.010> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
same mount same lenses and it's very

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.810 
same mount same lenses and it's very
similar<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> j-3<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.829> also<00:01:35.100> capable<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
similar to the j-3 it's also capable of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.359 
similar to the j-3 it's also capable of
15<00:01:36.150> frames<00:01:36.420> per<00:01:36.600> second<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.710> also<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.100> slow

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
15 frames per second it can also do slow

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.899 
15 frames per second it can also do slow
view<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.470> shoots<00:01:40.680> at<00:01:40.890> 10<00:01:41.100> megapixels<00:01:41.759> or

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
view but it shoots at 10 megapixels or

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.010 
view but it shoots at 10 megapixels or
10.1<00:01:42.450> mega<00:01:42.659> pixels<00:01:43.110> rather<00:01:43.439> than<00:01:43.649> 14.2<00:01:45.020> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
10.1 mega pixels rather than 14.2 and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.740 
10.1 mega pixels rather than 14.2 and
yeah<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> missing<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:48.060> manual<00:01:48.540> mode

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
yeah it's missing the the manual mode

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
yeah it's missing the the manual mode
selector<00:01:49.170> dial<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> top<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:51.119> need<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
selector dial on the top so you need to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840 
selector dial on the top so you need to
rely<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.170> menus<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.950> more<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
rely on the menus a little bit more so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030 
rely on the menus a little bit more so
yeah<00:01:54.030> two<00:01:54.270> new<00:01:54.450> 1-series<00:01:54.930> cameras<00:01:55.439> from<00:01:55.649> Nikon
