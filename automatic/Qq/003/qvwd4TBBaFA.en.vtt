00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 how are you then I introduce myself I 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.639
 my name is jean 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 the professional drummer for 25 years 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.330
 I played with the greatest Swiss 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.410
 in italy france germany all to all 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.520
 music styles 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.150
 1 jazz pop rock n roll hip 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.310
 hop too 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 finally all these musics like that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 no problem for me I have 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 always left without the professional the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.809
 professional he knows how to play invites 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.640
 very softly just like that then 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.079
 today but ensures if you look 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.179
 this video is that you want 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 learn something and then me 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.960
 as I am a professor of drums 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
 Well, I'll teach you something 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 it's still the goal because otherwise 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.550
 otherwise it's useless to go to a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 teacher if we do not learn anything then 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.039
 first lesson today we go a little 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 good is the technique for that it's 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.980
 really very important to hold the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.640
 chopsticks like that all to play a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.860
 halo 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 first then the chopsticks are there like 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 that huh it's easy you think like 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.550
 a stick there you want to hold 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.670
 I show the action of the bass between 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.939
 arm so the fingers or the arm too 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 bullfighter valued like that here you come 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.520
 you're doing something else on the other side of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 cross camp of gounod of all that you are there 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
 like that it's good and then after when 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.399
 it's good tac 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.840
 right nothing to fuck it takes directly 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.549
 play on the music of the professional and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.390
 play with musicians he plays 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.770
 not with methods 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.719
