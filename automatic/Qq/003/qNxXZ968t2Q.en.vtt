00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 ah 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.870
 once again 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.850
 ah 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.350
 ah 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 quiet 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 two 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 as if I'm online 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 the tortures girls are of the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.050
 the world's best- known cartoons and their 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 relationship with videogames has been 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.380
 just fantastic many of the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.120
 titles that have come out of this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 franchise have been among the best in their 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.620
 gender and even with the sadness of not 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.560
 applied by michael ryderstedt herminia 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.450
 I decided to make a top 5 of turtles 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.550
 ninja and I know that this list has been 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.440
 It is done to exhaustion but then 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 why do I get videos from youtube but 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.100
 to talk about ninja turtles and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.710
 videogames and things 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.080
 so now it 's my turn to talk about 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.060
 it so in disgrace of the new 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.580
 ninja turtle movie this top 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.259
 5 fuck Sunday number 5 for a long time 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.750
 this time was the definitive version 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.729
 of the ninja turtles the truth already 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.619
 we had played until singer the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.990
 version of arcadia that although it was very 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.310
 good because it required money to play and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.159
 this you can put the comfort of your 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.080
 house save a game that we did not expect 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.869
 that will surpass the arcadia version but 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.100
 It turns out that it is very funny and apart 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.580
 had two new levels and two new ones 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.110
 the cia quite funny this was one 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.569
 of the first games in my experience 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.390
 that had product placement and the truth 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.670
 we see pizza hot for the whole game what 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 which it is pretty guys in his time not 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.310
 that right now we're used to and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.800
 I wonder if that will have to do with my 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.580
 taste of pizza hut 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.580
 5 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.790
 number 4 this as I thought everyone 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.769
 we must have an agreement that we should 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.599
 forget it without honor school on the internet 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.969
 for the truth I do not understand it there are games 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.459
 much more unjust and more difficult in the 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.430
 month and I will know and we all liked it 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.750
 So, that's the way it was difficult 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.189
 but well I think this entry is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.370
 simply to defend a game that 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.469
 I really enjoyed that I honestly 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.120
 frustrated more not being able to but they had a 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.849
 great satisfaction every time a 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.099
 level the truth a great game and not so 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.169
 bad as everyone says is not the best 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.200
 but the truth of my favorite inÃ©s 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:09.299
 and by the way rafael is useless 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 in this game although maybe for 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.930
 sacrifice them 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.250
 number 3 this game is quite a case 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.900
 when I had it I liked it very much but 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.019
 I always felt that the super version 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.670
 nintendo tools in time was much better 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.319
 Now that I played it again I said 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.739
 very cool the truth if it was not 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.630
 in this top 5 even if it does not touch to be a 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.670
 little more based on the comic of some 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.800
 way there was really fun though 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.560
 basically recycles a lot of the version 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.410
 of sunda this game even though it 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.110
 hey hey they have longer levels and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 although it recycles a lot because I, but 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.450
 the sprites especially those intro 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.150
 radicals are more radical for that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.489
 we said between the 10 times this game 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.890
 I really liked it if you liked it 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.810
 another presents this he was delighted he is 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.880
 simply more of the same as for 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 nothing I say it in a bad way this is very 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.260
 well something like everything is a time and 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.110
 still hyperstone face the truth not 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.180
 they are quite valuable and also have the type 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.500
 bald from the second movie I guess that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.930
 that's a plus for some people 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.280
 last 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.820
 not for me 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.769
 number 2 when I thought I had already played 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.560
 the best games of ninja turtles 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.300
 this game my life one of the best 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.280
 ninja turtle games and one 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.960
 excellent then to elbow cake 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.270
 game that I had come to understand in 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.730
 this game differs mainly 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 because each turtle already has an attack 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.930
 special that takes a part of your life 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.580
 not everything is free but it also has a 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.950
 New attack allows you to throw your 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.470
 enemies over your head which is 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.000
 quite final because it 's a kilo glove 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.360
 as they say in my neighborhood I kill you in 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.430
 chinga gives a pretty useful attack I have 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.020
 it is much more colorful the truth has 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.930
 much more details of sounds beings 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.120
 great and believe it or not 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.970
 much the previous version of this game 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.090
 this is also considering that this 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.010
 game came out before the super game of 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.270
 all without time but after the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.910
 key version of all those years 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.400
 he was in the middle so he has many 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.290
 elements of the ark also here we see 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.419
 enemies of the movie like touch and 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.490
 race and I also think it 's the first 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.930
 appearance according to me of the super destructor 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.300
 in a console 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.729
 especially this game is very funny 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.620
 a considerable improvement the game 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.139
 previous from my favorites 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.180
 lately number one 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.879
 What can I say about this jo that I do not know? 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.060
 have already said excellent graphics great 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:41.129
 amazing gameplay music that puts you 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.020
 in action with five books later in 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.909
 for the players a version that 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.599
 completely surpasses the version of 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.669
 arcalia without a doubt this game forms great 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.169
 part of my childhood indeed 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.969
 Tokio and I, we give it a spin 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.819
 from in when the great thing that still 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:59.310
 is this game honestly is the maximum 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.680
 exclusion of the ninja turtles a game 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.860
 difficult to overcome the truth I do not see it 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.569
 soon still with a remake that failed 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.060
 capture the magic and I had this 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.590
 great game one of the best things 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.319
 history one of the best 20 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.849
 maps and definitely the best game of 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:21.099
 the unique turtles no doubt by paula 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.449
 well this was my top 5 away from the 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.339
 turtles measures do not forget to comment 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.339

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.940
 from your country and you choose either 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.590
 forget to comment 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.660
 and do not forget to like this 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.790
 video and watch some videos you know 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.470
 some files do not forget either 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.750
 subscribe and see you the one that follows 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.750
 it's just powers again
