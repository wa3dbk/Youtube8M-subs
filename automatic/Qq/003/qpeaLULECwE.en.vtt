00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.889
 at ateneo followers today has reached the floor in the test without a little 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.410
 awaits the most advanced of the Finnish mobile phone factory 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 the nokia 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.439
 in fact 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.300
 the nhc situation directly on top of the nokia family 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.760
 and from there try to retake the crown of the traffic lights that lost years ago 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.359
 with iphone output and so weak 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.419
 Brand new design line and it is built 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 in aluminum in various colors 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.110
 now the terminal is more solid 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.230
 but in return you no longer have direct access to the battery 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 It has a colorful amoled touch screen of 3 point five inches in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 Panoramic format 16 9 knots 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.900
 with a resolution of 640 by 360 pixels 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.620
 it's not that the fastest of the west hopes to do their job very well 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.520
 lynn 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.809
 forty more years 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.489
 two microprocessors 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.010
 one of them dedicated exclusively to the graphic theme has 16 gigas of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.219
 Expandable internal storage capacity up to 32 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.850
 with micro sd cards 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.900
 and what else do you have then you have not in all three point has wi-fi has 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.370
 gps and has the sm transmitter so you can 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.400
 the musical directly to the car radio 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.660
 For example, to take a look and out 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.420
 over here we have a connection my miles to be able to put some 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.600
 headphones 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.470
 here we have the hdmi connection here we have the on / off button 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.270
 volume control 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.670
 a key to lock the screen 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 another shortcut key to the camera 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
 the recharge commission owned by nokia 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 and on this side we are 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.700
 one slot for micro sd cards and the other great work is for sim card 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.570
 here we also have a micro sd commission consistency nor do I believe that 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 it serves 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.920
 to recharge the phone but also to use and enjoy the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.870
 luis m onevu technology 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 what do we have to do then we take this cable 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.260
 we plugged it 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.270
 in the groove 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.120
 and then we put 1s 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.610
 so you can see at the moment and in it any information that has that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 apple in the boe looks 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.180
 and in the same way 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.870
 the weser this serves as extra storage 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.789
 for tv 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:23.139
 to good and one of the jewels the 12 megapixel camera developed by Carl 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:23.689
 zeiss 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.979
 the claim alleges access 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.879
 aims to regulate the exhibition 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.680
 the only thing that we liked is that the funk in mere the progressive 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.060
 those high things that can be solved and hopefully solve in the next 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.629
 Software updates 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.819
 that yes the results send gaza less showy is that of the competition 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.699
 especially when they are images taken in low light 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.029
 let's jaguars that is full of well-built technology but 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.229
 unfortunately its operation is less impressive 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.049
 despite being the first to not use the new operating system 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.599
 symbian 3 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.739
 the results world peace 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.649
 it's better than the n97 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:06.559
 but it falls back into the same mistakes of unintuitive desktops - something 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.340
 complex 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.079
 and the excessive need for tiger confirms practically everything 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.499
 the absence of the qwerty keyboard in vertical format 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.919
 For having to confirm the commission of events every two to three 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.999
 are just two examples that usability is still not up to par 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.399
 than expected it has three desktops where the applications fit the 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.619
 meetings and that the accesses 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.169
 and although it is quite configurable 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.819
 little intuitive we have to wait to see what we have friend and if this 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.529
 solution to 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.180
 the media player I am very happy and compatible with a lot of 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:39.809
 formats and they also leave it 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.119
 with headphones like these 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.579
 that directly integrate the control of volume and songs 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.219
 another thing that we love ovi maps that is free for life and that works 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.349
 great even when you have coverage what comes in handy especially when 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.439
 you are traveling 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.539
 so they do not charge a lot of money using tools 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.189
 On the other hand, we also have the store 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.499
 that he still has a little bit to grow 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.699
 they were the ones who had mounted one thing 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.909
 let's see anniversary fashion game turns out 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.759
 in which the state costs you 69 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.209
 on android right now it's free and it turns out that you're coming 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.889
 at the same time and it costs you three with 0 6 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.739
 in euros 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.739
 gentlemen of nokia this must be solved quickly 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.530
 although clear 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.820
 if what you want that Nokia phone will always be 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.740
 the phone 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.999
 so the n8 is a good substitute for the smart Nokia 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.999
 but it will rarely take away users, that's when he 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.160
 We believe that the n8 is the team that needs Nokia three years ago. 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 free price is 499 euros and despite the small problems that has been 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.090
 won 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.930
 the lisset scowl 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.130
 she knows and is that if you want to know more about mobile or about any 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.690
 another blip women who visit between that point environment technology 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.850
 easy and fun until the next diagram
