and Scott was hannin the wheel wells

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.580

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wheel wells where nobody will ever see

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
wheel wells where nobody will ever see
them<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
them but that's what we do so on the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.940 
them but that's what we do so on the
front<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> Chevelle<00:01:33.540> John<00:01:34.020> attacked<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
front of the Chevelle John attacked the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
front of the Chevelle John attacked the
fenders<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.000> from<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> paddock

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
fenders that we got from the paddock

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
fenders that we got from the paddock
we're<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> couple<00:01:37.590> bolts<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.340> core

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we're just a couple bolts to the core

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
we're just a couple bolts to the core
support<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.650> by<00:01:40.799> Hyundai<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.460> should

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
support and I think by Hyundai we should

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.580 
support and I think by Hyundai we should
have<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> hood<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
have the hood on and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.469 
have the hood on and
he's<00:01:42.710> going<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.979> start<00:01:43.159> adding<00:01:43.429> bolts<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
he's going to start adding bolts and the

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
he's going to start adding bolts and the
wheelhouses<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.799> getting<00:01:46.460> everything<00:01:46.670> in

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
wheelhouses and getting everything in

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.929 
wheelhouses and getting everything in
the<00:01:46.969> gaps<00:01:47.179> online<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.409> by<00:01:48.770> next<00:01:48.829> week<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
the gaps online so by next week the

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.179 
the gaps online so by next week the
front<00:01:50.149> clip<00:01:50.329> should<00:01:50.539> be<00:01:50.679> really<00:01:51.679> firmed<00:01:51.950> down

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
front clip should be really firmed down

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.719 
front clip should be really firmed down
and<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> gaps<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.600> know<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.520> bolts<00:01:55.520> and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
and the gaps and I know that bolts and

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.440
