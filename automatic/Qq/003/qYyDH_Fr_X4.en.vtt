00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hello everyone, Anton and today it is important 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 and very video because a lot of very 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 questions about this in vsv to yes and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.949
 just on the end in the comments leaves 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:25.080
 guys in general now she will answer all this 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:29.279
 so let's start moving to 2013 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.560
 the year when I shot every day that is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.430
 not practically even until every day is clean 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.590
 the character is yours 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 in minecraft too many vidos 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 was and the most successful that was it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.010
 Naturally series school which gathered 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 a bunch of just views on each episode 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.590
 almost a million already have a series where two 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.239
 million total is all well and good 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.149
 everyone was waiting for the continuation that I promised 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 long and by the way time yes well a lot up to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.600
 overall many times and promised to try 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.500
 take off but in the end so nothing good 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 it did not work well and let me get you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 I'll tell you what it is all about 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.960
 although yes, I remember someone like that before 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.939
 filmed there every day very interesting 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 its now only stream there and so 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.100
 further it is all nonsense yes but in fact 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.920
 there is really no change 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.820
 Yes, and I changed, too, naturally grown 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.050
 then I was 13 and now you are almost 16 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.300
 that is, well, 16 is already of course so well 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 not really a school you can even 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:55.740
 age at 16x, too, is missing here in well 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.860
 general old days will not be back guys not 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 that's why they were better off and I would 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.560
 improve what we can remember now 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.380
 these shows are all great there 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 you are reviewing you just once and they 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:20.370
 never not on, and do not call on to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.620
 eat generally not get tired of watching them here 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.750
 and then they seem to be better that is already 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.930
 never make under any wish 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.590
 I suppose I can not now take it like this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.300
 here to remove and again the series about minecraft and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.160
 he will not pick up 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.920
 so many views like then he doesn't 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 will be so successful and popular 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.890
 because well even if in minecraft 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.830
 was again the most top games you can 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.709
 so to say that is how it was just 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.739
 still in the 13th year would still have everything and 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.209
 there are no more ideas 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.790
 already well I'm not the same one can say so and 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.210
 however I don’t know how to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.250
 want to 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.050
 I’ll mostly stream right now 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.790
 play there vx in the nose if you notice 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.980
 then many in the flash no longer 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.530
 shoot a vidos and just streaming on a tuba 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.740
 Well, or strimit on tviche and laid out 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.650
 on youtube your stream is 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.750
 don't bother but does the right thing 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.450
 In principle, because I, too, so 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.880
 it seems that the stream of mouse vidos 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.730
 first this stream will be recorded and will remain 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.530
 as a video, secondly, you can chat 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
 live there with your subscribers 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.810
 but if the audience is not that big yes 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.670
 there are up to 100 people 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.270
 here it is possible in principle by answering 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.670
 question and so on well in general look 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.370
 you can not ask me such questions 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.630
 Type of type when will himself so say 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.380
 about sampayo nothing rocks i'm a lot 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.990
 once already tried the pass as you remember on 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.230
 different servers 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.420
 popular project diamond forward and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.800
 nothing worked it out so 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.100
 well, boring, you understand, do anything 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.950
 Well, what's the point of playing where blood 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:26.300
 that is, there is everywhere here just on 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:29.240
 every server there are people who take 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.630
 always just like that in all organizations 0 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.750
 rank 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.450
 and so on in general, well, that is, samp is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.090
 generally nonsense 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.160
 so I tried to create my project 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.990
 where there would be that water where 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.230
 you watched him but nothing too 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.280
 It turned out because well, somehow not 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.850
 desires special 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.180
 do it all do it all I don't 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.480
 I know in general whether in the future 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.190
 I have some such projects here 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.650
 most likely will just be the most streaming 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.660
 shoot well shoot already 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.670
 there 1 week I go from the yard for the car max 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.680
 Well, in general, he himself probably will not 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.100
 and 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.039
 and minecraft too, I think we 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.690
 let's see in general how can but soon 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:22.650
 nedforspid any new challenge in general well 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.620
 something like this so imperceptibly the channel changed 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.630
 your heading you can say so that is 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.979
 your 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.389
 the main audience you can say so I 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.039
 lost that is a lot who left when i 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.539
 stopped shooting minecraft when on air 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:43.120
 he's very upset, I do not have to 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.300
 go on I take a new audience 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.330
 which will look to with dota and so 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.880
 further generally in principle, this is all about what i am 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.360
 wanted to talk to you I will not forget yet 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.900
 the rules are not such podcasts of this kind 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.169
 let's threads 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:03.190
 can be discussed on stream and so 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.250
 Further, in general, thank you all who watched 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.880
 until the end who listened to me carefully and 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.210
 will ask more such questions 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.889
 obvious and all 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.889
 all good luck
