be quite honest I don't really know

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.530 
be quite honest I don't really know
what's<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.469> package<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.910> am

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
what's in this package just because I am

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380 
what's in this package just because I am
actually<00:00:37.040> expecting<00:00:38.040> quite<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> few<00:00:38.969> packages

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
actually expecting quite a few packages

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.959 
actually expecting quite a few packages
that<00:00:39.750> story's<00:00:40.079> arrived<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.800> next<00:00:41.399> week<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that story's arrived by next week but

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
that story's arrived by next week but
then<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.230> one's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:44.100> early

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
then I think this one's a little early

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
then I think this one's a little early
so<00:00:45.239> i'm<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.629> sure<00:00:45.930> which<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so i'm not really sure which one of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.209 
so i'm not really sure which one of
those<00:00:47.610> packages<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
those packages is this so we're going to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
those packages is this so we're going to
know<00:00:50.430> today<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.239> i'm<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> open<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.890> oh

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
know today as i'm going to open this oh

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.430 
know today as i'm going to open this oh
i<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.059> i<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> open<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> without<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
i think i can open this without a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.189 
i think i can open this without a
scissor<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
scissor in this so this is how the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.820 
scissor in this so this is how the
package<00:01:02.129> looks<00:01:02.489> wrapped<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.780> envelope<00:01:04.260> or
