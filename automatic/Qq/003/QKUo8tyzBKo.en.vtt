start discharging now while that
discharge<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.469> waffle<00:00:56.120> that's<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> relay

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
discharge is all waffle that's the relay

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.130 
discharge is all waffle that's the relay
board<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.500> drives<00:00:59.809> firstly<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
board there that drives firstly that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
board there that drives firstly that
relay<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:01.980> turns<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> charging

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
relay there which turns on the charging

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
relay there which turns on the charging
circuit<00:01:04.140> which<00:01:04.290> obviously<00:01:04.589> charges<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> caps

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
circuit which obviously charges the caps

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
circuit which obviously charges the caps
and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.390> there's<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.810> relay<00:01:07.439> over<00:01:07.710> there

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and then there's that relay over there

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.070 
and then there's that relay over there
which<00:01:08.150> will<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> contact<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.780> i<00:01:09.840> should<00:01:09.900> say

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
which will the contact or i should say

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.539 
which will the contact or i should say
12<00:01:10.530> old<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.610> turns<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> lights

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
12 old as well which turns on the lights

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
12 old as well which turns on the lights
as<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.840> load<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> bank<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.530> we'll<00:01:16.710> see

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
as the load for the bank now we'll see

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.359 
as the load for the bank now we'll see
here<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.939> gets<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> 10<00:01:18.659> volt<00:01:19.369> will

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here when they gets down to 10 volt will

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.800 
here when they gets down to 10 volt will
charge<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.909> 100<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
charge it up to 100 and then

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.530 
charge it up to 100 and then
start<00:01:24.710> training<00:01:25.130> again<00:01:25.189> I'm<00:01:25.970> opposed<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.329> see

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
start training again I'm opposed to see

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.760 
start training again I'm opposed to see
it<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.659> hundred<00:01:26.810> volts<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:27.290> get<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.470> little<00:01:27.680> bit

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
it a hundred volts we get a little bit

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.450 
it a hundred volts we get a little bit
of<00:01:27.829> like<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:30.170> still<00:01:30.470> takes<00:01:30.649> some<00:01:30.920> time<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.189> do

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
of like it still takes some time to do

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.990 
of like it still takes some time to do
this<00:01:31.689> but<00:01:32.860> I'd<00:01:33.860> say<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:34.490> quite<00:01:34.759> neat

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
this but I'd say that that's quite neat

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.800 
this but I'd say that that's quite neat
I'm<00:01:35.360> very<00:01:35.630> happy<00:01:35.930> with<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.200> results<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.619> far<00:01:36.710> i

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
I'm very happy with the results so far i

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.660 
I'm very happy with the results so far i
figured<00:01:38.810> i'm<00:01:38.899> going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> be<00:01:39.320> using<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:40.039> 100

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
figured i'm going to be using a 100

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.969 
figured i'm going to be using a 100
million<00:01:41.000> fuse<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:42.140> zener<00:01:42.409> diode<00:01:42.679> for

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
million fuse and a zener diode for

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.480 
million fuse and a zener diode for
protection<00:01:43.429> on<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:45.409> divider<00:01:46.009> there<00:01:46.280> so

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
protection on that the divider there so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.370 
protection on that the divider there so
if<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.909> something<00:01:47.869> goes<00:01:48.020> wrong<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.289> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
if the something goes wrong in the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.230 
if the something goes wrong in the
divider<00:01:48.740> rather<00:01:49.520> than<00:01:49.670> blowing<00:01:49.909> out<00:01:50.210> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
divider rather than blowing out the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.139 
divider rather than blowing out the
Arduino<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.470> zener<00:01:52.009> diode<00:01:52.280> will<00:01:52.549> clamp<00:01:52.789> at<00:01:52.939> 5

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
Arduino the zener diode will clamp at 5

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.760 
Arduino the zener diode will clamp at 5
volts<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.689> then<00:01:53.810> if<00:01:53.929> too<00:01:54.079> much<00:01:54.200> current<00:01:54.500> tries

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
volts and then if too much current tries

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.710 
volts and then if too much current tries
to<00:01:54.920> flow<00:01:55.130> will<00:01:55.369> blow<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.119> hundred<00:01:56.360> million

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
to flow will blow the hundred million

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.169 
to flow will blow the hundred million
fused<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.740> think<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:58.280> well<00:01:58.520> within<00:01:58.789> a

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
fused I think that's well within a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.809 
fused I think that's well within a
reasonable<00:01:59.479> amount<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.409> protect<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.190> Arduino

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
reasonable amount to protect the Arduino

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.070 
reasonable amount to protect the Arduino
and<00:02:02.229> it's<00:02:03.229> it's<00:02:03.560> input/output<00:02:04.459> port<00:02:05.080> actually

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
and it's it's input/output port actually

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.620 
and it's it's input/output port actually
that's<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.439> an<00:02:06.560> analog<00:02:06.830> input<00:02:07.189> so<00:02:07.630> that's

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
that's just an analog input so that's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:28.119 
that's just an analog input so that's
about<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.670> hit<00:02:10.670> 150<00:02:11.420> volts<00:02:11.599> exercise

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.559 

so<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.189> see<00:02:29.340> now<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.549> exercise<00:02:29.819> between<00:02:30.239> work

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
so you see now the exercise between work

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.020 
so you see now the exercise between work
so<00:02:30.719> I<00:02:30.780> reset<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.170> Arduino<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:32.639> can<00:02:32.819> start

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so I reset the Arduino so we can start

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.140 
so I reset the Arduino so we can start
again<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.310> charge<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.459> up<00:02:35.549> all<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.819> label

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
again and charge it up all the label

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:47.260 
again and charge it up all the label
pressing<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> charge<00:02:36.780> command

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.020 

that's<00:02:47.900> approximately<00:02:48.250> 10,000<00:02:49.250> microfarads

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
that's approximately 10,000 microfarads

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.449 
that's approximately 10,000 microfarads
400<00:02:50.870> volts

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.830 

10<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.610> last<00:02:59.790> couple<00:02:59.940> volts<00:03:00.299> always<00:03:00.540> seem<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
10 the last couple volts always seem to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160 
10 the last couple volts always seem to
take<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.140> longest<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:03.330> battery<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:03.900> down

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

little<00:05:00.080> messy<00:05:00.199> messy<00:05:01.099> it<00:05:01.849> is<00:05:02.120> safe<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.719> is<00:05:02.780> it's

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
little messy messy it is safe it is it's

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.240 
little messy messy it is safe it is it's
got<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.620> circuit<00:05:03.979> breaker<00:05:04.099> on<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> 5<00:05:04.729> amp<00:05:04.939> breaker

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
got a circuit breaker on a 5 amp breaker

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.980 
got a circuit breaker on a 5 amp breaker
the<00:05:07.250> charging<00:05:07.879> circuit<00:05:08.150> has<00:05:08.240> got<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.360> tone<00:05:08.539> 15

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
the charging circuit has got a tone 15

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.629 
the charging circuit has got a tone 15
amp<00:05:09.169> fuse<00:05:09.409> which<00:05:09.620> will<00:05:09.830> well<00:05:10.219> that<00:05:10.430> will<00:05:10.520> go

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
amp fuse which will well that will go

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.390 
amp fuse which will well that will go
before<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:11.060> fuse<00:05:11.270> does<00:05:11.509> I<00:05:12.349> said<00:05:13.159> the<00:05:13.250> only

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
before the fuse does I said the only

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.589 
before the fuse does I said the only
thing<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.879> has<00:05:14.029> to<00:05:14.150> be<00:05:14.180> done<00:05:14.389> is<00:05:14.569> to

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
thing that has to be done is to

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.719 
thing that has to be done is to
completely<00:05:15.110> isolate<00:05:15.199> or<00:05:15.830> at<00:05:16.189> least<00:05:16.400> protect

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
completely isolate or at least protect

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.269 
completely isolate or at least protect
the<00:05:16.819> Arduino<00:05:17.360> from<00:05:17.629> any<00:05:17.900> spikes<00:05:18.650> or<00:05:18.949> anything

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
the Arduino from any spikes or anything

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.059 
the Arduino from any spikes or anything
like<00:05:19.310> that<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:21.020> right<00:05:21.289> now<00:05:21.439> the<00:05:21.500> Arduino<00:05:22.039> is

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
like that and right now the Arduino is

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.619 
like that and right now the Arduino is
running<00:05:22.370> off<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.759> USB<00:05:23.300> wall<00:05:23.750> wart<00:05:25.419> hope<00:05:26.419> I've

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
running off a USB wall wart hope I've

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.279 
running off a USB wall wart hope I've
got<00:05:26.779> a<00:05:26.810> few<00:05:26.900> covered<00:05:27.349> there

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.570 

the<00:05:32.889> outfit<00:05:33.189> everything<00:05:33.490> covered<00:05:33.759> I<00:05:33.969> think

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
the outfit everything covered I think

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.059 
the outfit everything covered I think
except<00:05:36.580> for<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.789> boom<00:05:36.969> no<00:05:37.389> boom<00:05:37.599> tonight<00:05:38.069> boom

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
except for a boom no boom tonight boom

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.249 
except for a boom no boom tonight boom
comes<00:05:39.309> after<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:39.759> finished<00:05:40.149> this<00:05:43.020> anyway<00:05:44.020> I'm

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
comes after I finished this anyway I'm

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.669 
comes after I finished this anyway I'm
going<00:05:44.469> this<00:05:44.589> I<00:05:44.770> now<00:05:45.009> thanks<00:05:45.520> for<00:05:45.639> watching
