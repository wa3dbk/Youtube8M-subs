00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello guys this is the video that I could not 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 come up on Tuesday where I'm going to draw 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.250
 a woman with statue effects of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.929
 marble do not forget to watch this video in hd 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.000
 and the list of materials in the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.090
 description of the video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.160
 with a pencil or a black pen 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.800
 begins to outline the figure of the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 woman and then to paint all the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 external area do it with a lot of patience and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 be careful so that it fits you evenly 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 any imperfection that has remained 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 in the outline of the woman fix it with 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.769
 a black graphic style or a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.260
 black pencil sharpened with a brush 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:42.290
 loaded with graphite I begin to darken 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 the shadow areas in the neck the hair 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.310
 legs dress and arms 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.940
 now with a fade with that darken 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.370
 the edges of the shadow areas of such 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.310
 so that the shading stays with 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.110
 way of de grade defines well the 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.080
 contours with a pencil hbo2 see and then 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.240
 is fulmina with a brush to give a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 general tone 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.190
 accentuates these contours again and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.600
 generates a bit of dark shadows with a 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 pencil 6 bo 4 b as well as the folds 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 of the dress also ace some lines in the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.470
 hair to simulate the orientation of the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.220
 hair 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.250
 then with your same black graph style 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.040
 begins to delimit the contours of your 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.130
 drawing especially the areas attached to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.480
 the shadows again deepens the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.860
 shadows with your pencil 4 bo 6 b and for 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:49.280
 finalizes lights in the hair 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.850
 on the edges of arms legs and dress 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.300
 and of course also in the lower part of the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.210
 floor and ready guys if you liked
