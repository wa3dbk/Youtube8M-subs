00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 my dears when we say that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.730
 the houses are made of fruit crate 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.730
 You do not believe, that's what you mean. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.660
 many awards 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.439
 watch and be amazed at this 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.439
 directly from Canada 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:38.520
 looks 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 this building and the turim made of wood 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.540
 when a club in there did not score 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.199
 for me the fifth building and made of 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.199
 Robinho 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.059
 your financial return 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 do you have a business swing claiming 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:36.619
 than wood but this causes this height 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.619
 it's not a wall here 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.910
 his brother and found the well sustains 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 santo andré but the rest is also 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.270
 future is everything tomorrow 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 and this building that we saw 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.770
 building will be like this 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.370
 watch what it will become or be 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.770
 that concrete wall is only the support 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.530
 even though it will fall too 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.400
 Maybe I'll stay here at Botafogo. 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.459
 be it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.459
 the structure all the way 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.210
 This is it, morning went further. 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.460
 ie if you want to build 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.830
 home you are not a bricklayer you are 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.770
 joiner right 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.320
 and this is it registered this 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.410
 curiosity so the impressive so 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.990
 even though all of the same wood all 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.070
 so raw material cheaper by 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.120
 theoretically né 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:03.530
 very expensive we can not 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 still understand how this works is 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.190
 show that the structure is part of the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
 car park 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.030
 profile the part of the wall the only goal 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.030
 weird 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.310
 an is this is registered curiosity 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.379
 comment is that you think 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.150
 forget the light in our channel cases 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.150
 to sign the channel and that's it
