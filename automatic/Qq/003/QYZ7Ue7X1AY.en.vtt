exclusive<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.360> TV<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.259> remote

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
exclusive to this TV is the remote

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
exclusive to this TV is the remote
control<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.220> opens<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
control that opens up here to have a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
control that opens up here to have a
full<00:01:55.020> qwerty<00:01:55.380> keyboard<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.579> actually

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
full qwerty keyboard so you can actually

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
full qwerty keyboard so you can actually
type<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.719> search<00:01:57.960> terms<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.680> passwords

type and do search terms and passwords
and<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.460> sort<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> stuff<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.909> lot<00:01:59.939> easier<00:02:00.299> than

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and that sort of stuff a lot easier than

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
and that sort of stuff a lot easier than
you<00:02:00.719> would<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.110> typical<00:02:01.649> TV<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you would with a typical TV that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
you would with a typical TV that
requires<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> use<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> virtual<00:02:03.810> keypad<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
requires you to use a virtual keypad and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069 
requires you to use a virtual keypad and
the<00:02:04.920> TV's<00:02:05.490> remote<00:02:05.610> control<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.750> promotes

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the TV's remote control so this promotes

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.839 
the TV's remote control so this promotes
a<00:02:07.200> real<00:02:07.350> step<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.099> thing<00:02:08.310> TV<00:02:08.700> also

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
a real step up for this thing TV also

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.520 
a real step up for this thing TV also
has<00:02:09.090> bluetooth<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> aim

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
has bluetooth so you don't have to aim

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.350 
has bluetooth so you don't have to aim
the<00:02:10.560> remote<00:02:10.920> directly<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> TV<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the remote directly at the TV and it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.280 
the remote directly at the TV and it
also<00:02:12.480> should

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
also should

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
also should
interface<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.769> some<00:02:13.980> Bluetooth<00:02:14.519> devices

we've seen from off angle the Vizio does

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.740 
we've seen from off angle the Vizio does
tend<00:03:35.729> to<00:03:35.790> wash<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> little<00:03:36.449> bit<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.659> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
tend to wash out a little bit of that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.229

that hit the screen the mat does a very
good<00:03:44.849> job<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.239> cutting<00:03:45.629> that<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:46.139> in

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
good job of cutting that down in

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.349 
good job of cutting that down in
reducing<00:03:46.829> glare<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.489> also<00:03:47.790> preserves<00:03:47.970> black

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
reducing glare it also preserves black

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.879 
reducing glare it also preserves black
levels<00:03:48.720> relatively<00:03:49.169> well<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.739> bright

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889
