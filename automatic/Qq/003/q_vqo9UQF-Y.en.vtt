00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.779
 Lacoste is uncertain 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.779
 for m 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.689
 hi everyone knows the brothers 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.759
 75015 how are you doing it okay 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.650
 today we meet for our 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.230
 tenth episode tutorial league 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.090
 so today we are on weapons mail 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210
 in r &amp; d 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.480
 yeah so Norman soto who play and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 yeah I do not like r &amp; d yeah so here 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.329
 you see I was putting myself here because 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.290
 what in fact was there two parts 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.540
 would have dropped on the same map 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.770
 on the same mode against the same player 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.750
 is he spent there all the time there go there 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.860
 they have changed but I think that I 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.510
 advise to do I do not know if I 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 will do it afterwards but I will 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 will show I think I will do it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.730
 these were very good players 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.530
 he expects from their true defense there we have 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.970
 a little loose because that one has seen 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.750
 nobody 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.360
 but normally you have all the time 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.670
 some duels at the level of the middle west 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.989
 of the young especially here is the yes 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.290
 we will put a card of course with 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.820
 all that is top of the house and not of 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.799
 locations of the map mme aw jones and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.049
 the big cylinder right in front of him 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.659
 we will say we will note on a threat on a 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.819
 map and so you have not present and atlas 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.499
 on the other hand yeah I made the same place 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.869
 than usual yes but you sucks thomas 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.149
 I take the r is actually gerber 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.889
 alone we are either 100 with united where m 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.990
 yes maybe you took the class there 

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:30.670
 for strategic choice yes but must not 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.670
 basically say play it with messi 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.959
 sir his cap cros designed camou pussy 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.250
 is 23rd im3 I had to have weight 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.810
 lightweight robustness and 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.180
 mas tactical syria would not only 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.140
 that's when we advise to do 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.130
 what are we going to monitor, ie 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.840
 that she has one who must take the saloon 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 for the n 8 and who is at the top on the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.720
 Heinz stele after watching mm20 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.560
 the the stairs on the left and the other one he goes 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.030
 try to ask the fastest 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.890
 possible 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.630
 technical jason to ask on b since 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.940
 good of course a poor thing is not that about 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.610
 him yes we are not good wheat say 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.450
 even when of course with our team of 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.780
 league which are therefore at 2073 atomic and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.890
 hayes quarrel you could see we're managing 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.940
 not too bad online that is to say that we 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.410
 did the raymond list had to do 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.680
 two defeats including one because of a 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.390
 disconnect so there you saw 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.340
 atomic was hot potato usually 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.870
 no no not all mixed the little brother yeah 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
 I know and I refuse the increases when 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.989
 not even bad because in fact the big 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.860
 brother called tales weeks or 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.270
 patrick or not everything for the intimate eh 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.010
 Well, he has my mother's desk and some 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.360
 children he does not like the drc these ways of 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 fashion at easily again the screen 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.310
 chatou not look there but not there 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.500
 got upset it's the bar this paper up 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.790
 double to the hague and cities that has 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.250
 done via but d in the bottom left on 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.630
 gold leaf that makes recruiters so 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.820
 there you will see that our members all 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.930
 finish on to his good scores of 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.390
 gone expensive there that I was there you have 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.530
 overrated the guy really knew 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.430
 that I was there and who did not 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.870
 put too many balls that's ok no it's so 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.790
 other things to say about 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.620
 this little hand some stitch stuff 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.330
 to be careful about all this 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.209
 okay you attack that you want 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.680
 ask here in this point there ie 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.630
 whether you take a guy who preaches 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.040
 vhf scanner and who are watching before 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.269
 go in and often a guy who sleep 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.010
 and henri d at the top left of 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.350
 the stairs what they arrive largely 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.760
 before you on this point so they 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.170
 often wait where at the top right 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.459
 so advise you the vhf scanner for 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.049
 find out where they are camping 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.210
 what except if of course and his cool 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.100
 and that it is useless 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.960
 but good after of course I do not think that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.790
 all the players having done is that 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.380
 introduce the guy in the front but he waits 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.270
 just in front of the entrance and the three 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.530
 other wires and two passes and middle that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.470
 could walk I think 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.090
 yeah that can be said that the guy 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.440
 but his head so that others they 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.390
 be on him the others and because 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
 middle expect it not or otherwise 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.230
 banal thing you have the posture then 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.430
 we want to go to 2 left a middle and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.700
 worried still past abbey 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.620
 stories to look at what finally and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.300
 stuff you did finally I tilt 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.310
 assure you taton soupa but of taught 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.960
 are sure that lets us know 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.730
 so precisely around if there is 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.380
 someone there he needed him 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.670
 really it's the same it's not 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.120
 because here it is a new radar 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.520
 etc. 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.810
 so just bassar turbo website not 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.760
 so it's just that lets know 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.900
 if there is anyone if you because that's a 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.490
 big reach even if you touch you 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.100
 know that around there are 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.110
 someone that's will make them lose 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.210
 this round is one to one 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.550
 said fonspa fonspa does not go 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.880
 delay to wait waits 8 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.930
 seconds 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.340
 well yes if we can talk 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.720
 quickly done the little technique for the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.130
 sheaf laid I think people 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.810
 are not too silly when you have eight 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.640
 seconds that's what he did on one 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810
 made to pay to eat tips like you 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.650
 tried to procrastinate when you're at 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.670
 a contract for example 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.020
 and as soon as you had eight seconds 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.180
 you go on the bank that you have 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.560
 asked you look what it takes to little 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.940
 nearly 7 and a half seconds to defuse 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.880
 not exactly exactly in fact this 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.760
 is not nearly so like that you 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.810
 are sure that the may cry arms 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.870
 and therefore you not kill him they 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.950
 be baÃ¯la pretend now even if 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.360
 you do the worst you 'll have when 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.550
 even won the round but it takes 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.780
 even try to check between the peaks 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.040
 team doing an idea on 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.300
 you are not going to the Buddha there 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.010
 for 20 seconds to prevent or even 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.960
 last eight seconds always need 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.640
 stay one side all that good then if 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.900
 you have a helmet usually you 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.520
 hear the guy defuse 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.780
 hunting bo which really means 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.980
 many mans series he admits he 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.600
 could put a music that's on 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.950
 the whole map in europe should jump to 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.350
 bottom of thought all that would change nothing 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.640
 did almost all the time there 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.590
 the hungry time wayne simmonds was doing 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.850
 all the time even rush actually with 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.170
 cities that passed in front of you who 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.030
 covered his back to the case also with 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.590
 passi middle you had 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.320
 atomic which passed to the left was under 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.150
 x which was passing right finally I cross 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.430
 his atomic right and left fray so 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.030
 there was all year long w 78 lille a 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.420
 little before 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.520
 a strong name 78 that remained in the 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.930
 house there and the other who rejected even 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.250
 I play and that's me who has 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.310
 issued I remember it was my part that 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.530
 yeah I remember the ars reminds me 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.870
 double the turn and after the vineyard 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.770
 castle of the two brothers besides I am 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.280
 asked what are you doing and the guy at 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.790
 background map 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.460
 whereas didier proisy way kind and 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.460
 it is the one in left knee no 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.480
 but it serves me I mean now 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.190
 it's me see i 'm three years old boonen 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.120
 a new faultless rice here is so we 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.780
 did not show a trick but basically what 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.200
 that I advise you when you 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.360
 defend 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.210
 it's someone who goes b with the limit 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.520
 with the important limit yes to a crazy 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.770
 or lunar end that's nerves and who gets 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.450
 puts that just show everything ahead on 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.280
 yellow do not know how to show re 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.240
 the just left you can go up and 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.320
 you make it you put the butt 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.390
 you look right right left 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.420
 left is the top not carnage style 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.620
 this is finally me I call it the 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.120
 carnage size since it does all the 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.740
 time for those who know well 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.630
 sure carnage of the millennium it does everything 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.970
 time that's precisely what was 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.930
 just to dany and second his 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.490
 many to look for in the little trick 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.780
 scrub round where it could do 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.070
 of our page because we can see 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.500
 metal even more behind 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.060
 look right left is necessarily so 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.140
 you see that you have them all alone 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.970
 on this point I'm going who all came 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.440
 you tell your friends 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.770
 bakel and where was happening gives me a kind 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.160
 yeah so the party is over 1 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.530
 we put a beautiful 6 0 so a 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.390
 that big scores on the other side we have 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.710
 really put to aa we really did not 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.480
 missed a thing and theoretical is going to be 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.790
 happy because he did 4-1 that would be 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.350
 it will change its flow of c-17 its 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.640
 receipts 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.080
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.280
 not to ask inaudible questions to 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.280
 all for the next map
