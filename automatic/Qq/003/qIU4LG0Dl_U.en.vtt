00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
really bad for natural hair but I think

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.140 
really bad for natural hair but I think
that<00:00:49.380> there's<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.800> sides<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:50.490> that<00:00:50.580> stories<00:00:51.030> I

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
that there's two sides to that stories I

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.280 
that there's two sides to that stories I
just<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> tell<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.810> about<00:00:51.990> my

winter break I went and I got the edges
redone<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.230> get<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.380> edges<00:01:13.770> we've

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
redone and when you get your edges we've

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
redone and when you get your edges we've
done<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.370> they<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.820> take<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.330> about

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
done all they do they take out about

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
done all they do they take out about
four<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:16.770> five<00:01:16.980> rows<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.490> hair<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.180> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
four or five rows or hair so about this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.219 
four or five rows or hair so about this
much<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:19.490> they<00:01:20.490> redo<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.510> then<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> kind

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
much and they redo them and then it kind

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
much and they redo them and then it kind
of<00:01:22.290> looks<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.530> fresh<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.460> middle

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
of looks more fresh but the middle

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
of looks more fresh but the middle
doesn't<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.479> need<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.750> redone<00:01:25.110> because

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
doesn't really need to be redone because

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710 
doesn't really need to be redone because
is<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.800> clean<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.760> much<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.360> reason<00:01:27.510> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
is not clean as much and the reason that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
is not clean as much and the reason that
I<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
I did that is because as you can see the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
I did that is because as you can see the
middle<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> mean<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> front<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.010> hair<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
middle I mean the front of my hair it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.960 
middle I mean the front of my hair it
starts<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:35.490> starts<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
starts to look all it starts to get

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810 
starts to look all it starts to get
really<00:01:36.180> thin<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.200> doesn't<00:01:37.650> break<00:01:37.770> off<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
really thin it doesn't break off but you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
really thin it doesn't break off but you
see<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.540> starts<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> grow<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:40.530> starts

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
see that as it starts to grow it starts

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
see that as it starts to grow it starts
to<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> twirl<00:01:41.820> around<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.600> if

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to kind of twirl around and that's if

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
to kind of twirl around and that's if
you<00:01:42.960> leave<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.260> like<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.470> too<00:01:43.799> long<00:01:43.979> that's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you leave them like that too long that's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.460 
you leave them like that too long that's
when<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.850> break<00:01:45.000> off<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
when they start to break off all the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.890 
when they start to break off all the
times<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.250> my<00:01:47.430> micro<00:01:47.820> braids<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.869> hair

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
times that I got my micro braids my hair

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.830 
times that I got my micro braids my hair
