Ron and today we're going to take a look
at<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.220> Cromwell<00:00:03.030> be<00:00:03.300> performing<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.410> this

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
at the Cromwell be performing on this

at the Cromwell be performing on this
wide<00:00:05.310> park<00:00:05.670> map<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.270> it's<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.350> mission

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
wide park map and it's about the mission

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.970 
wide park map and it's about the mission
of<00:00:07.890> setting<00:00:08.900> two<00:00:09.900> enemy<00:00:10.200> tanks<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.530> fire<00:00:10.559> or

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of setting two enemy tanks on fire or

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.539 
of setting two enemy tanks on fire or
set<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.090> tank<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.540> fire<00:00:12.570> two<00:00:12.990> times<00:00:13.370> this<00:00:14.370> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
set one tank on fire two times this is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.310 
set one tank on fire two times this is
so<00:00:14.700> far<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> most<00:00:15.660> ridiculous

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
so far one of the most ridiculous

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.810 
so far one of the most ridiculous
missions<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> mission<00:00:18.960> list

because<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> doesn't<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.359> matter<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.170> got

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because it doesn't really matter you got

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.480 
because it doesn't really matter you got
all<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> skill<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> world

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

you<00:00:23.789> still<00:00:24.000> need<00:00:24.119> luck<00:00:24.680> I've<00:00:25.680> been<00:00:25.920> doing<00:00:26.580> this

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
you still need luck I've been doing this

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
you still need luck I've been doing this
mission<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> long<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.529> finally<00:00:28.769> as

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
mission for a long time but finally as

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
mission for a long time but finally as
you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> see<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.210> completed<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
you can see I have completed it in the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.610 
you can see I have completed it in the
chrome<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.610> gonna<00:00:32.730> share<00:00:33.030> my

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
chrome will be so I'm gonna share my

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
chrome will be so I'm gonna share my
experience<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.149> first<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
experience with you first of all you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.350 
experience with you first of all you
would<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.090> tank<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.300> has

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
would want to have a tank that has

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.590 
would want to have a tank that has
either<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.530> toys<00:00:40.910> high-explosive<00:00:41.910> shells<00:00:42.180> or

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
either two toys high-explosive shells or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
either two toys high-explosive shells or
hash<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:44.059> rapid-firing<00:00:45.059> guns<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.110> why<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:47.210> why

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
hash or rapid-firing guns so why is why

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
hash or rapid-firing guns so why is why
is<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.600> Cromwell<00:00:49.110> such<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> good<00:00:50.160> tank<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is the Cromwell such a good tank for is

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.270 
is the Cromwell such a good tank for is
because<00:00:51.420> Cromwell<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.770> rate<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> fire<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because Cromwell has good rate of fire I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
because Cromwell has good rate of fire I
can<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.660> enemy<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> can

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
can get around the enemy so you can

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
can get around the enemy so you can
actually<00:00:55.920> set<00:00:56.309> them<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> fire<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.030> needed

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
actually set them in a fire if needed

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
actually set them in a fire if needed
and<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.460> much<00:00:59.520> why<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.030> using

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and that is pretty much why I'm using

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.590 
and that is pretty much why I'm using
Chrome<00:01:00.600> well<00:01:00.840> oh<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.550> let's<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
Chrome well oh you can use let's say a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.969 
Chrome well oh you can use let's say a
t25<00:01:06.600> whistie<00:01:08.689> 122<00:01:09.689> millimeter<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.290> 11<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
t25 whistie 122 millimeter you 11 that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
t25 whistie 122 millimeter you 11 that
will<00:01:11.189> work<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:17.000> squeeze<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.270> another

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
will work as well squeeze in another

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.679 
will work as well squeeze in another
shot<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.200> push<00:01:19.710> did<00:01:19.920> close<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> fence

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
shot there push did close to the fence

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
shot there push did close to the fence
so<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.380> British<00:01:23.040> head<00:01:23.310> round<00:01:23.580> which

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so you can use British head round which

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
so you can use British head round which
will<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.600> work<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> some

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
will also work on the back of some

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.569 
will also work on the back of some
things<00:01:27.470> but<00:01:28.470> yeah<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.890> many<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> will

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
things but yeah not many of you will

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.730 
things but yeah not many of you will
have<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.000> Hank<00:01:30.240> says<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.140> quite<00:01:31.229> hard<00:01:31.530> here

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
have that Hank says it's quite hard here

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
have that Hank says it's quite hard here
but<00:01:31.950> most<00:01:32.610> people<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.030> lower<00:01:33.479> care

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
but most people will have lower care

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.010 
but most people will have lower care
tanks<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.549> most<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.720> would

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
tanks which you know most people would

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
tanks which you know most people would
have<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.950> Cromwell<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:40.460> t-34<00:01:41.460> 85<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
have had the Cromwell the t-34 85 and I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.530 
have had the Cromwell the t-34 85 and I
think<00:01:42.600> those<00:01:42.810> two<00:01:42.840> things<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.700> possibly

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
think those two things are possibly

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.050 
think those two things are possibly
the<00:01:46.540> choice<00:01:47.020> for<00:01:47.320> most<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:47.799> guys<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.729> also

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
the choice for most of you guys and also

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.180 
the choice for most of you guys and also
it<00:01:49.180> leave<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> comment<00:01:50.080> below<00:01:50.320> on<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.650> tank

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
it leave a comment below on what tank

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.180 
it leave a comment below on what tank
you<00:01:51.700> completed<00:01:52.240> your<00:01:52.270> mission<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.979> is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
you completed your mission in this is

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.340 
you completed your mission in this is
the<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.570> t-55<00:01:56.229> 8<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.350> pretty

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the one for the t-55 8 which is pretty

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.399 
the one for the t-55 8 which is pretty
hard<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.710> get<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.520> have<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:00.970> say<00:02:01.240> some<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
hard to get I have to say some of the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.590 
hard to get I have to say some of the
missions<00:02:02.590> are<00:02:02.920> just<00:02:03.190> getting<00:02:03.850> ridiculous<00:02:04.210> but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
missions are just getting ridiculous but

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.260 
missions are just getting ridiculous but
as<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.590> can<00:02:05.710> see<00:02:05.770> relentless<00:02:06.490> tries<00:02:06.790> will<00:02:07.090> get

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
as you can see relentless tries will get

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.800 
as you can see relentless tries will get
you<00:02:07.390> there

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
you there

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.120 
you there
I<00:02:09.600> at<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.750> point<00:02:11.020> didn't<00:02:11.650> even<00:02:11.770> think<00:02:11.980> I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
I at this point didn't even think I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.640 
I at this point didn't even think I
would<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.400> able<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.350> mission

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650

Cromwell it seems like because of this
fast<00:04:02.160> rate<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.430> fire<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:03.020> also<00:04:04.020> it's<00:04:04.440> just

fast rate of fire and also it's just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.410 
fast rate of fire and also it's just
speed<00:04:07.110> can<00:04:07.680> get<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:07.920> around<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:09.300> don't

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
speed can get you around and you don't

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.220
