 babies in diaper adventures do not exist and are 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.150
 because his mother the nature of his relationship with his father is shallow 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 actually carlitos died long ago 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.470
 Carlos is a value 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.430
 dead domination 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 something happens in the basement doing 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.270
 there they were 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.470
 Angelica could not decide if there were 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.970
 impossible to do would be bad 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.229
 then he invented the same character in his head 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.840
 but with different genres 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.030
 Angelica was a bipolar schizophrenic becoming addicted to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.080
 narcotics 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 the solidity and its three 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.430
 but to interact with 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 the old systems 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.590
 an overdose of 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.380
 in his decision he married a prostitute who was looking for money 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 which was not 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.990
 fruit of the imagination of angelica the garbÃ­ but angelica did not notice the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.010
 difference 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.710
 reilly his creations 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.740
 and not follow his orders and in a fit of despair and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.100
 angelica hit us repeatedly placing and shouting 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.160

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.310
 a deformation 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 grows quickly 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.300
 dictated by its rarity that 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.900
 in the movie in which they travel to paris carlos marries a prostitute 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.490
 called tour he was actually going to marry a different prostitute but 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.919
 she only 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.239
 maybe he had a daughter called civil who was taken away by 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.499
 angelic imagine 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.229
 for the stories it tells 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.929
 suffered was actually his statement 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.929
 the one who followed the game 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.599
 his faith later becomes psychology 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.219
 when angelica died from drug overdoses of hers helped her with her 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.189
 funeral 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.510
 the death of angelica was sad because by his addiction it was removed from the 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.219
 society 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.479
 break with the network 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.449
 and its eventual 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.909
 she spent her last days 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.189
 besides school cafeteria 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.789
 or friends around g 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.879
 with the lives of their creations 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.669
 Angelica dies on March 5, 1994 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.230
 he was wrong 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.529
 Jesus who lost his job 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.999
 so he led a miserable life in the streets 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.409
 desperately for the situation 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.349
 the clinical case 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.009
 transforming 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.679
 in a booklet 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.679
 a new headquarters 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.979
 the company thought it was a good idea 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.729
 but what not 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.389
 the challenge had a past 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.409
 without knowing that to product of it mysteriously of the overnight 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.919
 It would be the most famous children's series in some countries 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.099
 it struck me 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.719
 this legend 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.529
 think about it 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.529
 the creations in the teve 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.649
 by people with 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.529
