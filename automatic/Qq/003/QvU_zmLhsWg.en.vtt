00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.200 
we're gonna be talking about deathless
and<00:00:26.720> how<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.260> become<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> deathless<00:00:28.859> because

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
and how you become a deathless because

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.759 
and how you become a deathless because
some<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> death<00:00:30.660> lists<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.619> sure

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
some of the death lists are I'm not sure

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
some of the death lists are I'm not sure
if<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:32.640> some<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.510> least<00:00:33.690> some

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
if it's all or some but at least some

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
if it's all or some but at least some
are<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.860> deathless<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:36.210> they're<00:00:36.420> born<00:00:36.660> they

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
are not deathless when they're born they

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
are not deathless when they're born they
become<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.649> way<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> talk

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
become that way and so I want to talk

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.080 
become that way and so I want to talk
about<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.690> becomes<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.230> deathless<00:00:41.090> all

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
about how one becomes a deathless all

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.700 
about how one becomes a deathless all
right<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> nothing's<00:00:42.840> definite<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
right so the nothing's definite in this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
right so the nothing's definite in this
area<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> theory<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> think

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
area but I have a theory that I think

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500 
area but I have a theory that I think
could<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.870> true<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.440> right<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
could be true all right so I think the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.389 
could be true all right so I think the
way<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> become<00:00:54.989> deathless<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> similar<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
way to become deathless is similar to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
way to become deathless is similar to
the<00:00:56.520> way<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.640> become<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> conduit<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the way you become a conduit in the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520 
the way you become a conduit in the
infamous<00:00:58.890> games<00:00:59.480> spoilers<00:01:00.480> ahead<00:01:00.840> videos<00:01:01.230> and

there's another one coming out with the
ps4<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> infamous<00:01:10.650> games<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> become

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ps4 but in the infamous games you become

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.830 
ps4 but in the infamous games you become
a<00:01:12.600> conduit<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> conduit<00:01:15.390> gene

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a conduit if you have the conduit gene

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520 
a conduit if you have the conduit gene
and<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.920> inside<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.840> area<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.350> race

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and you're inside the area of a race

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
and you're inside the area of a race
fear<00:01:19.799> blast<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> play<00:01:21.659> list<00:01:22.049> too

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
fear blast and or if you play list too

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.600 
fear blast and or if you play list too
you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.000> beast<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.600> John<00:01:25.369> has<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you know that the beast or John has a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
you know that the beast or John has a
power<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.570> similar<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.080> race<00:01:28.259> your

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
power that's very similar to a race your

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
power that's very similar to a race your
blast<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> doesn't<00:01:29.189> basically<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> same

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
blast and doesn't basically the same

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.230 
blast and doesn't basically the same
thing<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.369> you're<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> conduit<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
thing but if you're a conduit and you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.370 
thing but if you're a conduit and you
have<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> conduit<00:01:33.689> gene<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.110> erase<00:01:34.350> your

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have the conduit gene and erase your

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
have the conduit gene and erase your
blast<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.220> John's<00:01:35.520> power<00:01:35.820> goes<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.390> near

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
blast and or John's power goes off near

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
blast and or John's power goes off near
you<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.950> power<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.579> everyone<00:01:38.820> around<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> who

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you the power of everyone around you who

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450 
you the power of everyone around you who
doesn't<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> condo<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> gene<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:41.250> be

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
doesn't have a condo a gene will be

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.030 
doesn't have a condo a gene will be
absorbed<00:01:41.970> into<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
absorbed into you and then you get the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.170 
absorbed into you and then you get the
power<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.340> those<00:01:44.460> people<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> become<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
power of those people and you become a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.469 
power of those people and you become a
conduit<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:46.979> those<00:01:47.100> people<00:01:47.220> die<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
conduit and all those people die so I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
conduit and all those people die so I
think<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> become<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.040> condo<00:01:50.460> an

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
think the way you become a condo an

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.859 
think the way you become a condo an
infamous<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> similar<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
infamous is similar to the way you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.200 
infamous is similar to the way you
become<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> deficit<00:01:52.799> without<00:01:53.130> any<00:01:53.250> blood<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
become a deficit without any blood so I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
become a deficit without any blood so I
think<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.200> some<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
think that you have to have some kind of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.620 
think that you have to have some kind of
gene<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> deathless<00:01:58.320> gene<00:01:58.649> we'll<00:01:58.979> call<00:01:59.189> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
gene the deathless gene we'll call it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
gene the deathless gene we'll call it
and<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> gene<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and if you have that gene you have you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
and if you have that gene you have you
are<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.090> potential<00:02:03.719> deathless<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
are a potential deathless now if that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
are a potential deathless now if that
gene<00:02:05.700> isn't<00:02:05.969> activated<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> die<00:02:06.960> you'll

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
gene isn't activated and you die you'll

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.910 
gene isn't activated and you die you'll
just<00:02:07.530> die

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.770 

and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.129> there's<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.939> would<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.689> an

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and then there's also would be an

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.270 
and then there's also would be an
immortal<00:02:13.019> game<00:02:13.379> because<00:02:13.680> immortal<00:02:14.159> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
immortal game because immortal and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280 
immortal game because immortal and
deathless<00:02:14.519> are<00:02:14.819> different<00:02:15.689> in<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> Infinity

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
deathless are different in the Infinity

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.809 
deathless are different in the Infinity
Blade<00:02:16.379> world<00:02:16.650> immortal<00:02:17.189> means<00:02:17.340> you'll<00:02:17.609> live

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
Blade world immortal means you'll live

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.149 
Blade world immortal means you'll live
forever<00:02:17.969> unless<00:02:18.299> you're<00:02:18.540> killed<00:02:19.159> deathless

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
forever unless you're killed deathless

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.470 
forever unless you're killed deathless
means<00:02:20.310> you'll<00:02:20.430> live<00:02:20.609> for<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:20.909> your<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.239> live

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
means you'll live for out your you live

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.640 
means you'll live for out your you live
forever<00:02:21.719> no<00:02:21.810> matter<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.290> you're<00:02:22.379> killed

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
forever no matter if you're killed

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
forever no matter if you're killed
unless<00:02:22.829> it's<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.219> infinity<00:02:23.670> blade<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
unless it's the infinity blade or the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.759 
unless it's the infinity blade or the
workers<00:02:25.049> repulsor<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:27.379> you<00:02:28.379> have<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.739> a

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
workers repulsor so you have to have a

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.099 
workers repulsor so you have to have a
deathless<00:02:29.340> gene<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.609> normal<00:02:30.239> gene<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.780> we're

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
deathless gene a normal gene but we're

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.479 
deathless gene a normal gene but we're
gonna<00:02:31.230> step<00:02:31.469> and<00:02:31.620> deathless<00:02:31.799> cuz<00:02:32.129> deathless

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
gonna step and deathless cuz deathless

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.379 
gonna step and deathless cuz deathless
are<00:02:32.609> much<00:02:32.849> cooler<00:02:33.120> than<00:02:33.299> immortal<00:02:33.689> people<00:02:33.959> ah

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
are much cooler than immortal people ah

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.819 
are much cooler than immortal people ah
but<00:02:36.389> see<00:02:36.780> you'd<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.439> deathless

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
but see you'd have to have the deathless

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.520 
but see you'd have to have the deathless
gene<00:02:38.159> I'm<00:02:38.849> only<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.269> select<00:02:39.719> some<00:02:39.989> people<00:02:40.379> have

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
gene I'm only a select some people have

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.369 
gene I'm only a select some people have
it<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.829> I'm<00:02:41.730> not<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.450> sure<00:02:42.569> how<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.049> you

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
it and I'm not really sure how that you

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.890 
it and I'm not really sure how that you
will<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.709> activated<00:02:44.419> there's<00:02:45.419> a<00:02:45.510> couple<00:02:45.750> ways

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
will be activated there's a couple ways

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.690 
will be activated there's a couple ways
that<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.189> off<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.340> top<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.579> my

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that I can think of off the top of my

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.240 
that I can think of off the top of my
head<00:02:47.970> drag<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.230> could<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.709> something<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.129> do

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
head drag or could have something to do

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.330 
head drag or could have something to do
with<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.639> maybe<00:02:51.419> drug<00:02:51.810> route<00:02:52.049> blood<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.709> don't

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
with it maybe drug route blood I don't

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.649 
with it maybe drug route blood I don't
know<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.760> sounds<00:02:54.060> kind<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.269> weird<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.599> don't

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
know that sounds kind of weird I don't

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.849 
know that sounds kind of weird I don't
know<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.349> cult<00:02:55.680> anything<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.709> really

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
know like a cult anything I don't really

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.459 
know like a cult anything I don't really
know<00:02:59.099> how<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.700> gene<00:03:00.120> would<00:03:00.269> be<00:03:00.299> activated<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
know how that gene would be activated it

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.440 
know how that gene would be activated it
could<00:03:01.709> be<00:03:01.829> several<00:03:02.370> kinds<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.669> things<00:03:05.450> maybe

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
could be several kinds of things maybe

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.270 
could be several kinds of things maybe
that<00:03:06.599> was<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.049> Infinity<00:03:07.500> blades<00:03:07.709> alternate

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
that was the Infinity blades alternate

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.129 
that was the Infinity blades alternate
purpose<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.659> all<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.780> stopped<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
purpose because of all I stopped the

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.690 
purpose because of all I stopped the
Infinity<00:03:10.500> level<00:03:10.709> was<00:03:10.799> for<00:03:11.159> more<00:03:11.340> than<00:03:11.489> killing

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
Infinity level was for more than killing

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.990 
Infinity level was for more than killing
deathless<00:03:13.159> maybe<00:03:14.159> there's<00:03:14.400> something<00:03:14.819> maybe

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
deathless maybe there's something maybe

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.309 
deathless maybe there's something maybe
God<00:03:15.329> can<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.659> something<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.199> don't

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
God can do something about it I don't

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.640 
God can do something about it I don't
know<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.919> what<00:03:17.159> I<00:03:17.190> think<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:18.409> there<00:03:19.409> is<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
know but what I think is there is a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.699 
know but what I think is there is a
deathless<00:03:20.280> gene<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.609> normal<00:03:21.209> gene<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:22.590> you

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
deathless gene a normal gene that you

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.110 
deathless gene a normal gene that you
have<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.519> then<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.729> has<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:24.000> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
have to have and then that has to be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.960 
have to have and then that has to be
activated<00:03:24.540> somehow<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.439> then<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.250> become

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
activated somehow and then you become

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.830 
activated somehow and then you become
deathless<00:03:27.449> and/or<00:03:27.780> immortal<00:03:28.379> now<00:03:29.419> some<00:03:30.419> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
deathless and/or immortal now some of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.659 
deathless and/or immortal now some of
the<00:03:31.079> death<00:03:31.260> lists<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.709> still<00:03:31.979> they<00:03:32.340> still

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
the death lists are still they still

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.640 
the death lists are still they still
look<00:03:32.909> like<00:03:32.939> they<00:03:33.329> used<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.659> be<00:03:33.780> human<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.319> I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
look like they used to be human but I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.229 
look like they used to be human but I
mean<00:03:35.250> they're<00:03:35.370> not<00:03:35.459> obviously<00:03:35.849> not<00:03:36.000> even

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
mean they're not obviously not even

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.819 
mean they're not obviously not even
anymore<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.750> love<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.349> body<00:03:37.620> of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
anymore but this love like the body of

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.319 
anymore but this love like the body of
each<00:03:37.979> human<00:03:39.949> yet<00:03:40.949> they're<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.489> bigger<00:03:41.819> like

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
each human yet they're like bigger like

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.819 
each human yet they're like bigger like
veins<00:03:42.689> an<00:03:42.900> example<00:03:43.349> of<00:03:43.439> that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
veins an example of that

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.929 
veins an example of that
now<00:03:44.419> if<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:46.319> way<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:46.919> become<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> deathless<00:03:47.699> is

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
now if the way to become a deathless is

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.409 
now if the way to become a deathless is
similar<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.139> way<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.239> Ray<00:03:51.359> sphere

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
similar to the way like the Ray sphere

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.439 
similar to the way like the Ray sphere
blast<00:03:51.900> works<00:03:52.199> an<00:03:52.409> infamous<00:03:52.919> like<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:54.000> absorbs

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
blast works an infamous like it absorbs

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.569 
blast works an infamous like it absorbs
the<00:03:54.569> people<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.799> don't<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.310> deathless

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
the people that don't have the deathless

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.399 
the people that don't have the deathless
gene<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.120> could<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.629> reason<00:03:57.930> why<00:03:58.199> there's

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
gene that could be a reason why there's

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.830 
gene that could be a reason why there's
so<00:03:58.650> much<00:03:58.769> bigger<00:03:59.159> that's<00:04:00.000> kind<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.479> stretch

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
so much bigger that's kind of a stretch

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.390 
so much bigger that's kind of a stretch
I<00:04:01.139> don't<00:04:01.319> really<00:04:01.500> think<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:02.069> that's<00:04:02.220> just

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
I don't really think that that's just

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.770 
I don't really think that that's just
kind<00:04:02.699> of<00:04:02.729> a<00:04:02.849> theory<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.269> was<00:04:03.359> throwing<00:04:03.569> out

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
kind of a theory that I was throwing out

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.670 
kind of a theory that I was throwing out
there<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:07.139> yeah<00:04:07.949> so<00:04:08.759> to<00:04:08.819> recap<00:04:09.509> I<00:04:09.989> think<00:04:10.409> that

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
there so yeah so to recap I think that

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.929 
there so yeah so to recap I think that
to<00:04:10.919> become<00:04:11.189> a<00:04:11.220> deathless<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.639> have<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.819> have

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
to become a deathless you have to have

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.789 
to become a deathless you have to have
the<00:04:12.030> deathless<00:04:12.419> gene<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.959> then<00:04:13.079> something

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
the deathless gene and then something

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.580 
the deathless gene and then something
has<00:04:14.729> to<00:04:14.970> happen<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.419> activate<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.199> gene<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
has to happen to activate that gene and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.860 
has to happen to activate that gene and
then<00:04:16.680> become<00:04:16.979> deathless<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.539> that's<00:04:18.690> my

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
then become deathless I think that's my

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.479 
then become deathless I think that's my
basic<00:04:19.289> theory<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.979> how<00:04:20.250> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
basic theory on how to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.749 
basic theory on how to
become<00:04:20.699> my<00:04:20.789> deathless<00:04:21.470> because<00:04:22.580> like<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.699> said

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
become my deathless because like I said

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.450 
become my deathless because like I said
it's<00:04:24.389> like<00:04:24.569> a<00:04:24.979> Donald<00:04:25.979> mustards<00:04:26.250> tend<00:04:26.400> to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
it's like a Donald mustards tend to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.339 
it's like a Donald mustards tend to
podcast<00:04:26.819> it<00:04:27.000> I'm<00:04:27.509> not<00:04:27.630> sure<00:04:27.690> if<00:04:27.900> he<00:04:27.990> said<00:04:28.139> all

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
podcast it I'm not sure if he said all

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.930 
podcast it I'm not sure if he said all
or<00:04:28.380> some<00:04:28.830> but<00:04:29.160> at<00:04:29.310> least<00:04:29.520> some<00:04:29.759> of<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
or some but at least some of the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.510 
or some but at least some of the
deathless<00:04:30.120> were<00:04:30.389> not<00:04:30.599> always<00:04:30.780> deathless<00:04:31.520> so

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
deathless were not always deathless so

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.710 
deathless were not always deathless so
at<00:04:32.639> least<00:04:32.789> some<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.030> them<00:04:33.180> were<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.300> born<00:04:33.660> that

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
at least some of them were not born that

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.930 
at least some of them were not born that
way<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.259> they<00:04:34.889> had<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.160> have<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.460> gene<00:04:35.669> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
way and they had to have the gene and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.370 
way and they had to have the gene and
then<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.090> was<00:04:36.210> activated<00:04:36.660> by<00:04:36.690> some<00:04:36.990> event

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
then it was activated by some event

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.990 
then it was activated by some event
obviously<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.280> don't<00:04:38.370> know<00:04:38.520> what<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:38.729> event

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
obviously I don't know what that event

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.640 
obviously I don't know what that event
is<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:40.620> mean<00:04:41.039> it<00:04:41.220> could<00:04:41.400> be<00:04:42.560> something<00:04:43.560> from

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
is I mean it could be something from

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.070 
is I mean it could be something from
drag<00:04:43.949> or<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.639> don't<00:04:44.940> know<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:45.300> this<00:04:45.690> link<00:04:45.990> from

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
drag or I don't know in this link from

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.900 
drag or I don't know in this link from
the<00:04:46.199> Infinity<00:04:46.590> Blade<00:04:46.710> instead<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.669> killing

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
the Infinity Blade instead of killing

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.909 
the Infinity Blade instead of killing
death<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.389> creates<00:04:48.630> deathless<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:49.259> both<00:04:49.650> I

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
death as it creates deathless or both I

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.520 
death as it creates deathless or both I
guess<00:04:50.150> but<00:04:51.150> anyway<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.960> hope<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.259> enjoyed

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
guess but anyway so I hope you enjoyed

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.730 
guess but anyway so I hope you enjoyed
this<00:04:52.650> theory<00:04:53.300> it's<00:04:54.300> probably<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:54.960> in<00:04:55.560> my

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
this theory it's probably that's in my

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.290 
this theory it's probably that's in my
opinion<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.190> most<00:04:56.310> probable<00:04:56.759> one<00:04:56.819> for<00:04:57.180> how

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
opinion the most probable one for how

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.080 
opinion the most probable one for how
you<00:04:57.360> become<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.780> deathless<00:04:58.669> but<00:04:59.669> that's<00:04:59.819> it<00:05:00.000> for

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
you become a deathless but that's it for

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.820 
you become a deathless but that's it for
this<00:05:00.150> video<00:05:00.330> guys<00:05:00.539> hope<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:01.229> enjoyed<00:05:01.530> if<00:05:01.800> you
