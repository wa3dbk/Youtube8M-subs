00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone, now I show you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.640
 some examples on type to realize the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.550
 nail art with the toilet technique 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.860
 marble is very simple as a technique 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.630
 however seen reading the comments that do not 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.940
 succeeds all girls 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 so today I decided to show it to you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 so in the hill tip and look for a little bit 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.480
 to answer all the questions you have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 they are then made to remove a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 With doubts, then let's get started 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 on our hands I refer you to it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.829
 last video I made that was a marble 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 for valentine's day it is very expensive milosa e 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 where I also show how to cover the skin 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 with scotch tape to avoid that then yes 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 can dirty with enamel and many 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 girls say to use the cream at 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 last place I tried to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 use the cream but obviously the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.590
 my cream was not good because a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.090
 contact with cream water 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.870
 practically yes it expanded e 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 released some substance 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 evidently and then when I went to re 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 then apply the enamel for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 make the other fingers this patina that yes 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.930
 created that he had created the cream 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 prevented the enamel from enlarging 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.860
 so I still prefer to use 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.570
 Scotch then to see how 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.590
 apply the scotch to the fingers 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.330
 I refer you to the other video where I have it 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 realized on myself the necessary for 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.659
 this technique is a glass with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.150
 these are great water too 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 of paper I advise you not to throw them 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 in the sense that it would be a waste if 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 you can keep it maybe while 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.650
 from inside the brushes I know something about 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.509
 it is because so much if we then want to go to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.189
 use at least let's avoid of of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.189
 waste it toothpick or many 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.040
 people use lake with a bow 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 paper and paper use also a 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.030
 sheet to keep as a basis to avoid 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.079
 to dirty the floor so many girls me 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.850
 they ask if the water should be 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.600
 room temperature if it has to be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.570
 warm cold and purple water use 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.430
 but real tap environment 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.409
 however the water is not the same in all 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.759
 city ​​then 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.950
 we are obviously components a bit 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.530
 different from city to city from region to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.090
 region and therefore if it fails if 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 you see that just no enamel yes 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.459
 enlarge it could be the fault of the water 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.930
 so in the case change and use 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.519
 water from the bottle then water 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.379
 natural bottle 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.959
 we go to enamels stops 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.580
 I use the glazes you use 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.560
 they are usually for this technique 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.840
 these unjust enamels of the same brand but 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.959
 the walls which is a brand found by 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.790
 in the chains nine t nine meaning and therefore 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.560
 they cost 99 cents so they are 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.340
 therefore they are perfect for this technique 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.160
 cheap and a lot of enamel is wasted with 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.250
 this technique so here is use 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.099
 one low cost polish to me is better and 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.930
 above all they are the only ones with all of them 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.599
 the colors widen because I have 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.190
 noticed that with the various brands some yes 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.060
 widens in some do not expand 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.230
 so it often depends on the enamel if 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.269
 failed to find in yours 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.430
 these city what I recommend you 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.760
 I do is to take the enamels that 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.650
 you have to try to put a drop after it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.660
 the other inside the water to see 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.980
 which widen with no you do one 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.470
 list so at least the next time 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.599
 already sees the list with the enamels that yes 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.370
 however, they do widen attention because some 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.380
 enamels widen but dry 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.299
 so fast that they prevent the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.519
 Next drop to widen then 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.169
 it is not enough to do the test with a drop 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.459
 do the test put a drop and then it is 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.290
 went to put another drop for 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.750
 see if it still allows color 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.079
 next to enlarge here I chose 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.680
 to use these three colors and 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.680
 let's start right away 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.190
 if you don't dare just move 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:59.360
 in the water and for me or I can 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:10.950
 begin to move my colors 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:19.830
 shoddy when I get a shape 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:23.610
 like I take when then but with a bow 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:29.070
 blow to known the enamel e 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.200
 lincoln excess here is where they hope 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.710
 all of it on long now I try to 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.710
 these hours 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:52.770
 ok let's start this time i do some 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.770
 different 

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:04.860
 he told me I like this part 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.400
 so here's where a technique with the 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.390
 which you can pick at as best as you can 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.150
 you want and simply move it 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.100
 nail polish as you like 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.410
 and nothing I hope to have been useful to you 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.410
 and there a reality , a kiss hello
