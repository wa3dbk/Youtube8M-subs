00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.369
 welcome to the entrance this is an often problematic area during the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.050
 first thing our guests see when they come into the house and unfortunately it is the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.499
 area more difficult to keep in order but don't give up there are a couple of 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.849
 simple things we can do to bring order back to chaos 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.829
 mission here is a nice cabinet where you put your shoes and where everyone is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.289
 they find it in the morning now and with a tiny little junta we can 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.649
 customize for each of the family members so everyone 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.990
 Sat Sun and keep your snap 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 let's go on afa 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.560
 renata - in this family there are 4 people and therefore it can become a lot 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 nice to code this shoe rack so that everyone knows where the shoes are 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.690
 their things 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 we use the color that ideal to convert a room to 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 personalize objects when the surface to color English is 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.510
 treated we have to switch slightly with the paper inside so that the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 color attacks right 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.650
 photo here now I have removed the most glossy part and I have obtained a surface 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.780
 opaque on which the color stands well now to have use from the edges 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 simple burst of coffee and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 because the best thing I want to show you is how easy it is to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.030
 renewing the look of a piece of furniture did not have to surrender to the first 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.720
 4-speed difficulty 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 nutria calls us creativity 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.090
 here it is 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.320
 because we will do it well to stick the adhesive tape so the color won't 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.410
 thread it under 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 opac amo forte because now all that remains is to choose which color to start 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.300
 amaranten sooo that I will start with this booloo lavender because it really is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.359
 text 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.469
 rt of course you are the one who chooses your home 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.939
 and the colors that suit us best 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.449
 I like this one 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 caravan 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.689
 2 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 but 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.339
 photo 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:40.379
 and here we have taken very little time now, let's try the tape immediately 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.709
 before the color dries out if we don't risk it coming off together with tape 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.279
 so if we are fast 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.459
 we get a clean and beautiful edge 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 better than that could not come what you say 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.230
 we don't know how to create a beautiful blue square with a white border all around me 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.230
 three colors remain for walls 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.040
 maybe you're wondering what paint I'm using the app is a water paint 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.819
 perfect for covering very well and is easy to apply 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.590
 you can also work and if there are children around you don't have a strong smell 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
 I could list other advantages but in my opinion it is simply perfect for 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.590
 these odd jobs at home 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.129
 volvo ok now I'm done with these feet too let it dry a little 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.349
 but if you want we will have to go to the entrance and see how they are 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.689
 sure we will see some beautiful atdhe known 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.909
 poems here we are put back in place the damage works perfectly time 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.139
 I put the race in this top we put on men's shoes 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.629
 he takes the red one 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.250
 we close back 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 and when all the drawers are safer you can see all the colors not there 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 I randomly chose elio taken from the wallpaper you see the same beautiful 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.380
 blue of which I have spoken to you before equitalia and there are also the green and the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.480
 others can work this way to give the room a sense of harmony 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.939
 especially in a space like district coming comer 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.619
 rafa polipo peso those that look like two circles of metal film is beautiful 

00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:21.219
 furniture 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.379
 but in reality it is a fabulous info and communication bulletin board when you do 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.639
 come in and leave and province messages tell us what we have to do 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.250
 ooh get lost oh mommy i love you your dad i'm glad i have what 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.979
 you want are very sea practice and the color and black takes over the color of the 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.389
 background of our yattaman upholstery 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.240
 poker now we just have to complete putting that extra touch I go to 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 take a few things 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.210
 then we await them here 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.849
 I finished 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.770
 how can we really say that this entrance was messy and a little 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.729
 sad now it is more communicative and well organized bora 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.610
 great space for shoes 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.729
 it is a wall of messages we have moved with color and now this 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.280
 family a1 more space to the vehicle then the guests will also feel 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.419
 the beauty is welcomed even better, because it didn't take us so long 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.780
 it took very little
