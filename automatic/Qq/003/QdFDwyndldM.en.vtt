 lucas who has just returned from school 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.779
 my son is a real treasure but they 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710
 also often reserve surprises 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.500
 today lucas is back from school 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 no problem for that too I have the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.539
 solution 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 no way that lucas stays with his 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.440

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.250
