00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
make sure the crate obviously is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.590 
make sure the crate obviously is
appropriate<00:00:16.369> size<00:00:16.609> for<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.119> dog<00:00:17.359> and

can<00:00:21.109> have<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.349> bigger<00:00:21.619> crate<00:00:21.980> because<00:00:22.189> you're

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
can have a bigger crate because you're

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.159 
can have a bigger crate because you're
not<00:00:22.669> trying<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:23.029> do<00:00:23.119> housebreaking<00:00:23.689> with<00:00:23.990> it

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
not trying to do housebreaking with it

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.040 
not trying to do housebreaking with it
it's<00:00:24.980> just<00:00:25.220> a<00:00:25.339> containment<00:00:25.759> area<00:00:26.329> so<00:00:26.689> I<00:00:26.720> would

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
it's just a containment area so I would
