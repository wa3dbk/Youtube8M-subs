00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello there maybe a little bit 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.620
 it's windy after all 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
 open space and now the bonus 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.590
 awning which is installed on 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 Stretched weight 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.460
 1200 grams somewhere they lied to the trend 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.090
 with arcs set well let's 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.090
 proceed to install 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.520
 as we saw from the installation 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.900
 set this tent in the wind 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 alone is just really impossible 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.730
 hold if he instilled with the wind more 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950
 somewhere 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.870
 sense to attack anthony is not very much 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.020
 there will be an analysis 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.060
 Rain protects the Japanese and she actually 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.350
 there are adjustments that is just like you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.740
 stuck pegs 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:56.760
 need attraction but with this set 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 meters means the sail area 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 romania just pulls them out 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:14.910
 taped seams 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:19.230
 reinforced corners he was also 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.930
 special grommet upstairs now 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.360
 probably it is not visible and you are not visible 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.050
 there will be a general grommet at the top is the same 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.540
 reinforced corners all middle part 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.690
 taped and a little bit 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.610
 reinforced extra 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.090
 the new to better keep the middle 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 tension 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.890
 if we look at the tent itself it has 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.200
 hexagon formula and not mother wrong 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.460
 each side is not rounded 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.450
 not square it and coal and 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.540
 accordingly in essence 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.340
 about the right hex for cycling trips 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.080
 given the severity of arcs 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.380
 This awning is not suitable for 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.830
 any 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.730
 about another macaw where you need to set the field 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.380
 so in time of sun or rain you can 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.100
 it was ok to have dinner but again 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.410
 if there is wind any steppe in the morning 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 you will not find this tender blown away black 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.560
 magic but in campaigns on karabie for example 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.130
 cut down the campaign he himself very well 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.280
 recommended as an awning for the kitchen 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.530
 that is, it was just perfect and irreplaceable 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.900
 he stood in the lowlands and in the evening he was not 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.030
 scary anything come on but what its 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.790
 can be installed not only with pegs 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.900
 all the trees down there you can play 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:50.600
 constructions due to this site is possible 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.569
 but at the same time it is due to its geometry 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.140
 he is not 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.620
 will be exactly stretched like a square shorter 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.840
 where if you throw a kilo two hundred you can 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.030
 exploit not necessarily not 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.040
 sure to say so with arcs daddy 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.709
 It can become another home need to leave 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:24.150
 at home and you are not even awning 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:26.580
 arc now shorter favor this hysteria 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.669
