00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
interesting about this is it what made

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
interesting about this is it what made
this<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.739> easy<00:01:05.009> with<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.489> plans<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this so easy with these plans is that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
this so easy with these plans is that
this<00:01:06.329> also<00:01:06.540> comes<00:01:06.899> with<00:01:06.960> full-size<00:01:07.409> templates

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this also comes with full-size templates

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
this also comes with full-size templates
so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.060> able<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> cut<00:01:09.509> everything<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.990> use

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so I was able to cut everything out use

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080 
so I was able to cut everything out use
the<00:01:10.350> templates<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.579> since<00:01:11.790> we've<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the templates actually since we've got a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.389 
the templates actually since we've got a
lot<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.299> matching<00:01:13.170> pieces<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.009> should<00:01:14.219> say

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
lot of matching pieces and I should say

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.249 
lot of matching pieces and I should say
matching<00:01:14.610> mirrored<00:01:15.299> pieces<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
matching mirrored pieces right and you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
matching mirrored pieces right and you
don't<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> use<00:01:16.829> that<00:01:17.070> template<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.850> one

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
don't want to use that template the one

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
don't want to use that template the one
time<00:01:18.329> so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> took<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.140> templates<00:01:19.560> transferred

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
time so I took the templates transferred

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
time so I took the templates transferred
that<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.579> something<00:01:20.880> harder<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> fact

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that to something harder like I in fact

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
that to something harder like I in fact
I<00:01:21.869> used<00:01:21.899> blue<00:01:22.200> poster<00:01:22.560> board<00:01:22.740> oh<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.039> gosh<00:01:23.219> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I used blue poster board oh my gosh you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.889 
I used blue poster board oh my gosh you
then<00:01:23.670> took<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> blue<00:01:24.090> poster<00:01:24.420> board<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
then took the blue poster board to the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.170 
then took the blue poster board to the
cedar<00:01:25.140> cut<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.829> out<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.369> used<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
cedar cut it out I actually used the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
cedar cut it out I actually used the
bandsaw<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.140> these

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
bandsaw because you got all these

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.529 
bandsaw because you got all these
strange<00:01:28.740> shapes<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.909> guess<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.329> could

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
strange shapes right I guess you could

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.450 
strange shapes right I guess you could
use<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> jigsaw<00:01:31.229> though<00:01:31.409> sure<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:32.039> didn't<00:01:32.310> have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
use a jigsaw though sure he didn't have

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
use a jigsaw though sure he didn't have
that<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that just take a little more time and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
that just take a little more time and
then<00:01:34.049> he<00:01:34.200> saying<00:01:34.469> now<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.009> everything

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
then he saying now this is everything

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.099 
then he saying now this is everything
for<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> chair<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.659> full<00:01:36.869> chair

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
for the chair this is the full chair

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.599 
for the chair this is the full chair
right<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.280> got<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
right here so all we got to do is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:39.980 
right here so all we got to do is
assembly<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
assembly well all you got to do is a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.920 
assembly well all you got to do is a
simple<00:01:40.140> wait<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> minute<00:01:40.829> wait<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> minute

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
simple wait a minute wait a minute

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.080 
simple wait a minute wait a minute
Allen<00:01:42.770> couldn't<00:01:43.010> stay<00:01:43.250> away<00:01:43.490> long<00:01:43.730> which<00:01:44.060> is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
Allen couldn't stay away long which is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.210 
Allen couldn't stay away long which is
good<00:01:44.450> because<00:01:44.660> it<00:01:44.930> really<00:01:45.230> takes<00:01:45.410> two<00:01:45.800> sets<00:01:46.100> of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
good because it really takes two sets of

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.250 
good because it really takes two sets of
hands<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.970> hold<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.360> stuff<00:01:47.600> together

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
hands to hold the stuff together

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.170 
hands to hold the stuff together
we're<00:01:48.620> pre<00:01:48.860> drilling<00:01:49.130> before<00:01:49.400> driving<00:01:49.880> our

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
we're pre drilling before driving our

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.360 
we're pre drilling before driving our
screws<00:01:50.510> because<00:01:50.720> cedar<00:01:51.260> can<00:01:51.560> split<00:01:51.920> very

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
screws because cedar can split very

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.790 
screws because cedar can split very
easily<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.060> it'd<00:01:53.180> be<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.360> shame<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.110> ruin<00:01:54.650> one

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
easily and it'd be a shame to ruin one

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.920 
easily and it'd be a shame to ruin one
of<00:01:54.920> these<00:01:55.010> pieces<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:56.090> order<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.479> assembly

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
of these pieces the order of assembly

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.719 
of these pieces the order of assembly
and<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.140> plans<00:01:57.440> makes<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.950> big<00:01:58.280> difference

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and the plans makes a big difference

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.940 
and the plans makes a big difference
here<00:01:58.970> because<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.660> allows<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.470> keep<00:02:00.680> the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
here because it allows you to keep the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.030 
here because it allows you to keep the
structure<00:02:01.310> square<00:02:01.910> as<00:02:02.150> you<00:02:02.210> add<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.260> it<00:02:03.290> for

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
structure square as you add to it for

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.770 
structure square as you add to it for
load<00:02:04.190> bearing<00:02:04.400> joints<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> legs<00:02:05.479> we're

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
load bearing joints like the legs we're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.900 
load bearing joints like the legs we're
using<00:02:05.990> small<00:02:06.440> carriage<00:02:06.860> bolts<00:02:07.220> instead<00:02:07.760> of

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
using small carriage bolts instead of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.969 
using small carriage bolts instead of
screws<00:02:08.179> for<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> little<00:02:08.690> extra<00:02:08.959> strength<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
screws for a little extra strength the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.650 
screws for a little extra strength the
carriage<00:02:10.280> bolts<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.729> galvanized<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
carriage bolts are galvanized and the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020 
carriage bolts are galvanized and the
screws<00:02:12.050> are<00:02:12.260> coated<00:02:12.860> deck<00:02:13.130> screws<00:02:13.520> but<00:02:13.820> if<00:02:13.910> you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
screws are coated deck screws but if you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.670 
screws are coated deck screws but if you
want<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.270> spend<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.570> little<00:02:14.660> extra<00:02:14.840> money<00:02:15.080> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
want to spend a little extra money you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.979 
want to spend a little extra money you
can<00:02:15.890> also<00:02:16.130> use<00:02:16.580> stainless<00:02:16.910> steel<00:02:17.150> fastener<00:02:17.810> in

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
can also use stainless steel fastener in

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.290 
can also use stainless steel fastener in
fact<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.590> could<00:02:18.739> also<00:02:18.890> use<00:02:19.280> another<00:02:19.489> species

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
fact you could also use another species

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.870 
fact you could also use another species
of<00:02:20.510> wood<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:21.260> fir<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:22.010> build<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.430> chair<00:02:22.670> if

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
of wood like fir to build this chair if

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.400 
of wood like fir to build this chair if
you<00:02:23.030> wanted<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.170> cool<00:02:24.380> thing

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you wanted to that's the cool thing

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.740 
you wanted to that's the cool thing
about<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.980> plan<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.120> eliminates

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
about a plan like this it eliminates

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.720 
about a plan like this it eliminates
most<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.410> trial<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.950> error<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.580> can

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
most of the trial and error but you can

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.729 
most of the trial and error but you can
still<00:02:28.940> customize<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.230> meet<00:02:30.380> your<00:02:30.410> taste

what you doing all of the cutting and
Sandy<00:02:35.060> putting<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.480> thing<00:02:35.630> together<00:02:35.780> was<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
Sandy putting this thing together was a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.229 
Sandy putting this thing together was a
brewery<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:37.010> was<00:02:37.190> mr.<00:02:37.700> great<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
brewery it really was mr. great but the

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.180 
brewery it really was mr. great but the
real<00:02:38.390> test<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.140> how<00:02:39.290> comfortable<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.040> this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
real test is how comfortable is this

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.040 
real test is how comfortable is this
thing<00:02:40.430> there's<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.850> great<00:02:41.120> design<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.780> plans

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
thing there's a great design the plans

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.410 
thing there's a great design the plans
were<00:02:42.290> great<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.970> real<00:02:44.150> test

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
were great but this is the real test

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.240 
were great but this is the real test
right<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:46.420> sit<00:02:47.420> here<00:02:47.570> for<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.780> while<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:49.070> we

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
right here sit here for a while and we

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.699 
right here sit here for a while and we
used<00:02:49.549> cedar<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.450> build<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.870> chair<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.560> it's

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
used cedar to build this chair and it's

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.500 
used cedar to build this chair and it's
fairly<00:02:51.920> resistant<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.790> weather<00:02:53.000> we're

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
fairly resistant to the weather we're

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.509 
fairly resistant to the weather we're
gonna<00:02:53.600> put<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> semi-transparent<00:02:54.530> stain<00:02:55.040> over

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
gonna put a semi-transparent stain over

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.210 
gonna put a semi-transparent stain over
it<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.970> protect<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.510> even<00:02:56.690> more<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:58.010> then

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
it to protect it even more and then

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.580 
it to protect it even more and then
maybe<00:02:58.519> after<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.030> dries<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.930> position<00:03:00.140> it

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
maybe after it dries I can position it

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.190 
maybe after it dries I can position it
well<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.070> bluff<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.549> get<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> little<00:03:02.660> rest

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
well on the bluff and get a little rest

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.810 
well on the bluff and get a little rest
and<00:03:03.320> relaxation<00:03:03.500> around<00:03:04.250> here<00:03:04.430> instead<00:03:04.700> of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
and relaxation around here instead of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.450 
and relaxation around here instead of
all<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.180> work
