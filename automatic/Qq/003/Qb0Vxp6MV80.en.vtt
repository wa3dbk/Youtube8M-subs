think we've beaten it into submission
let's<00:00:52.559> squash<00:00:53.039> together<00:00:53.520> any<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.750> cracks

let's squash together any little cracks

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.240 
let's squash together any little cracks
and<00:00:55.430> start<00:00:56.430> rolling<00:00:57.260> when<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> roll<00:00:58.590> start

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and start rolling when you roll start

the<00:01:10.770> reason<00:01:11.130> we're<00:01:11.280> constantly<00:01:11.729> rotating<00:01:12.360> out

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the reason we're constantly rotating out

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
the reason we're constantly rotating out
them<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.290> keep<00:01:13.500> even<00:01:14.159> thickness<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> shape

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
them is to keep even thickness and shape

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.289 
them is to keep even thickness and shape
and<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.290> solve<00:01:16.500> sticking<00:01:17.220> problems<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:18.119> they

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and to solve sticking problems when they

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.109 
and to solve sticking problems when they
just<00:01:18.720> start<00:01:19.159> instead<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> dough<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
just start instead of when the dough is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.469 
just start instead of when the dough is
thoroughly<00:01:21.600> glued<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.280> counter<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
thoroughly glued to your counter if you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
thoroughly glued to your counter if you
get<00:01:24.810> stuck<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.530> stick<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.220> dough<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
get stuck and stick your dough with a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.840 
get stuck and stick your dough with a
pastry<00:01:26.970> scraper<00:01:27.409> move<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> sprinkle<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> work

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pastry scraper move it sprinkle the work

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.859 
pastry scraper move it sprinkle the work
surface<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.450> flour<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.259> keep<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.189> rolling

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
surface with flour and keep on rolling

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.960 
surface with flour and keep on rolling
there<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> misconception<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.950> too<00:01:35.759> much

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there is a misconception that too much

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140 
there is a misconception that too much
flour<00:01:36.360> makes<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.229> dough<00:01:37.409> tough<00:01:38.000> too<00:01:39.000> much

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
flour makes the dough tough too much

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.230 
flour makes the dough tough too much
flour<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.500> dough<00:01:40.530> makes<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.970> flour

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
flour in the dough makes it up the flour

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 
flour in the dough makes it up the flour
that's<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.079> outside<00:01:43.740> doesn't<00:01:44.250> develop<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's on the outside doesn't develop a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's on the outside doesn't develop a
gluten<00:01:45.119> network<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.020> harmless<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
gluten network so it's harmless if you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
gluten network so it's harmless if you
get<00:01:47.490> excess<00:01:47.939> flour<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> dough<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
get excess flour on the dough when you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
get excess flour on the dough when you
are<00:01:49.530> done<00:01:49.740> brush<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.790> off<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> pastry

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
are done brush it off with a pastry

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020 
are done brush it off with a pastry
brush<00:01:52.189> let's<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.610> big<00:01:53.729> enough<00:01:53.880> for

brush let's see if it's big enough for

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
brush let's see if it's big enough for
our<00:01:54.299> tart<00:01:54.720> pan<00:01:55.790> looks<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.439> our<00:01:58.439> dough<00:01:58.920> didn't
