reason why I like raw sugar is because

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.969 
reason why I like raw sugar is because
it<00:02:01.030> hasn't<00:02:01.240> been<00:02:01.509> overly<00:02:01.930> processed<00:02:02.320> and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.710 

and<00:02:15.460> now<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:15.820> mix<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:17.010> cafe<00:02:18.010> con<00:02:18.190> leche<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:19.540> the
