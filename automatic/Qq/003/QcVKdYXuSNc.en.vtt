everything<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.659> able<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> give<00:01:25.049> them<00:01:25.080> some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
everything it's able to give them some

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.480 
everything it's able to give them some
more<00:01:25.409> chocolate<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.890> they're<00:01:26.009> able<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> battle

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
more chocolate so they're able to battle

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
more chocolate so they're able to battle
a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.150> more<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> what's<00:01:28.350> cool<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
a little bit more and what's cool is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
a little bit more and what's cool is
they<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.070> start<00:01:29.250> throwing<00:01:29.280> everything<00:01:30.000> they

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they just start throwing everything they

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
they just start throwing everything they
can<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> ten<00:01:30.960> tails<00:01:31.170> both<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> Eight

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
can in the ten tails both the Eight

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
can in the ten tails both the Eight
Tails<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> nine<00:01:32.790> tails<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.150> doing<00:01:33.360> these

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
Tails and the nine tails are doing these

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
Tails and the nine tails are doing these
barrages<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.530> beach<00:01:34.890> balls<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.400> back

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
barrages of like beach balls just back

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
barrages of like beach balls just back
and<00:01:35.850> forth<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> doesn't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and forth right at it but it doesn't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.080 
and forth right at it but it doesn't
mean<00:01:37.979> anything<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.759> ten<00:01:38.939> tails

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
mean anything because the ten tails

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
mean anything because the ten tails
literally<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.810> its<00:01:39.990> own<00:01:40.079> version<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
literally does its own version of the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
literally does its own version of the
beast<00:01:40.890> ball<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.060> bit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
beast ball which is a little bit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.520 
beast ball which is a little bit
different<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.079> comes<00:01:43.409> out

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
different because it actually comes out

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
different because it actually comes out
is<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> giant<00:01:44.280> black<00:01:44.670> beam<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.750> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is like a giant black beam and it just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.179 
is like a giant black beam and it just
it<00:01:46.049> looks<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.530> cool<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.009> just

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it looks really cool and it just

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
it looks really cool and it just
decimates<00:01:47.700> everything<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.899> powerful<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
decimates everything it's so powerful in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
decimates everything it's so powerful in
fact<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.979> both<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> QV<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> even<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> eight

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
fact that both the QV and even the eight

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
fact that both the QV and even the eight
tails<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.200> lose<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> their<00:01:53.009> tails<00:01:53.220> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
tails you lose a few of their tails in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160 
tails you lose a few of their tails in

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
when we get to see that they actually

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
when we get to see that they actually
have<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.070> great<00:01:59.219> plan<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.820> attacking

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
issues with the fact that it didn't

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
issues with the fact that it didn't
really<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.020> much<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.440> personality

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
really have much of a personality

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.740 
really have much of a personality
compared<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.730> say<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> eight<00:02:45.300> tails<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
compared to like say the eight tails of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.530 
compared to like say the eight tails of
the<00:02:45.840> nine<00:02:46.020> tails<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.670> Toby<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.940> madara<00:02:48.300> just

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the nine tails and Toby and madara just

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.090 
the nine tails and Toby and madara just
immediately<00:02:48.960> taken<00:02:49.380> control<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
immediately taken control of it and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.250 
immediately taken control of it and
everything<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.760> did<00:02:51.270> like<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.600> little<00:02:51.810> spat

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
everything I did like that little spat

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
everything I did like that little spat
that<00:02:52.530> Toby<00:02:52.860> had<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.700> madara<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> very

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that Toby had with madara at the very

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.820 
that Toby had with madara at the very
beginning<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:55.020> he's<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.530> want

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
beginning where he's like you just want

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.590 
beginning where he's like you just want
to<00:02:55.890> test<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.220> thing<00:02:56.400> out<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> kid<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
to test this thing out like a kid you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.940 
to test this thing out like a kid you
can<00:02:57.750> almost<00:02:57.840> sort<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.260> sense<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.620> there's<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
can almost sort of sense that there's a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.680 
can almost sort of sense that there's a
little<00:02:59.220> bit<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.550> tension<00:02:59.850> between<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.510> two

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
little bit of tension between the two

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.300 
little bit of tension between the two
and<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.350> think<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.680> only<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.890> matter<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.220> time

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and I think it's only a matter of time

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.400 
and I think it's only a matter of time
before<00:03:02.940> mad<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:03.450> decides<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:04.080> gonna<00:03:04.230> cut

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
before mad are decides and I'm gonna cut

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.460 
before mad are decides and I'm gonna cut

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.250 
to change a little bit more as it goes

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
all I know is it's really intense right

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.990 
all I know is it's really intense right
now<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.860> i'm<00:03:47.040> pretty<00:03:47.220> sure<00:03:47.490> that<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.730> beast

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000

ball<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.720> eight-tails<00:03:49.020> is<00:03:49.230> about<00:03:49.410> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
ball that the eight-tails is about to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.350 
ball that the eight-tails is about to
hit<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.710> ten<00:03:49.890> tails<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.310> i<00:03:50.520> don't<00:03:51.180> think

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
hit the ten tails with i don't think

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.430 
hit the ten tails with i don't think
that's<00:03:51.450> gonna<00:03:51.600> work<00:03:51.720> i<00:03:52.080> think<00:03:52.290> there's

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
that's gonna work i think there's

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.570 
that's gonna work i think there's
probably<00:03:52.500> going<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.830> be<00:03:52.890> some<00:03:53.190> work<00:03:53.400> around

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
probably going to be some work around

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.400 
probably going to be some work around
and<00:03:53.970> do<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.240> because<00:03:54.390> there's<00:03:54.960> no<00:03:55.080> way<00:03:55.200> 10

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
and do that because there's no way 10

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.140 
and do that because there's no way 10

out of each other so I really enjoyed it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.930 
out of each other so I really enjoyed it
but<00:04:04.800> I'm<00:04:04.890> still<00:04:05.130> only<00:04:05.280> gonna<00:04:05.460> give<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> nine

but I'm still only gonna give it a nine
out<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.150> ten<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.570> only<00:04:06.720> reason<00:04:06.960> I'm<00:04:07.020> gonna<00:04:07.140> do

out of ten the only reason I'm gonna do

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.870 
out of ten the only reason I'm gonna do
that<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.590> because<00:04:07.740> like<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.040> said<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.430> wanted<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
that is because like I said I wanted the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.100 
that is because like I said I wanted the
ten<00:04:09.030> tails<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.450> little<00:04:09.630> bit<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.020> a

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
ten tails out a little bit more of a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.930 
ten tails out a little bit more of a
personality<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.800> maybe<00:04:10.950> explain<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> little

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
personality and maybe explain a little

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.730 
personality and maybe explain a little
bit<00:04:12.090> more<00:04:12.240> about<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.540> ten<00:04:12.690> tails<00:04:12.840> but<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.680> know

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
that's going to be coming down the line

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.670 
that's going to be coming down the line
