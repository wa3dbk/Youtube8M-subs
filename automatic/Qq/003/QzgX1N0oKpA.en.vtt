00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
destroy those four laser face over there

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.290

you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.220> jump<00:02:22.460> into<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.610> jump<00:02:25.880> into

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you can jump into it so you jump into

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.300 
you can jump into it so you jump into
the<00:02:26.210> pipe<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.860> brings<00:02:28.040> his<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.520> place

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
and you just get all the charges boxes

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.650 
and you just get all the charges boxes
that<00:02:38.340> they<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:39.290> until<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.819> see<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.450> you

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
charges 30 so i can get to 30 charges

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.540 
charges 30 so i can get to 30 charges
you<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.290> bring<00:03:01.440> them<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:01.980> door<00:03:02.280> and
