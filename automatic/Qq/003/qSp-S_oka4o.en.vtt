00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 forest panel tv offering 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.530
 reforestation environment with whom 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.509
 understands 67 3026 17 00 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.850
 with the passage of time the planting of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.070
 Eucalyptus forests increasingly come 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.160
 showing that it's a great deal 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 for several sectors such as cellulose 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.779
 for the production of real estate paper 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 the construction of sheet metal and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.820
 conversations and charcoal 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.829
 every day that passes the driving of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 forests for solid wood or 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.780
 taking space in the market and each time 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 more producers are investing in this 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 purpose has passed the forests of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.800
 eucalyptus is the case of a rural producer 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 in the municipality of jaraguari here mato 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.260
 southern grosso 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 see in the report that the panel 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.690
 prepared for you to understand 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.370
 because the solid wood is shaking the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 forest market 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.199
 much is said about eucalyptus forests 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.530
 very versatile wood is used to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 various energy production purposes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 charcoal cellulose building construction 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 and believe in lumber 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.970
 today we will meet a forest of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 eucalyptus that is being driven to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.400
 this end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 we went to a country estate in the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 municipality of jaraguari and mato grosso do 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 south talk to the producer is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 investing for this purpose and for 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.509
 understand this subject better 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.750
 we talk to the professional 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.750
 specialized 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.520
 the ideal management for a forest of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.920
 solid way is you do the planting after 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.190
 for a year and a half 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.440
 you do we call it pours withdraw 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 the branches are green for this 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.490
 forest this tree after being disarmed 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.220
 all of its growth rings will 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.830
 to generate wood without knot 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.710
 namely wood cleaned wood intended for 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.600
 the furniture industry in every detail is 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.300
 important when it comes to driving 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.850
 production for solid wood requires 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.050
 have a lot of dedication because the work is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.410
 meticulous 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.320
 the first says branches be made be 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.239
 done when the tree is one year old 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.300
 up to a year and a half 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.670
 We'll check in the tree loco. 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.640
 It shows a further substation 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.280
 knowledge of its stem and it shows 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.500
 how far can you get these 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.030
 branches that would have between are 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.070
 superfluous tree 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.560
 It shows then we took the first 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.620
 says branches about ten feet from 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.269
 height on the first exam on the second 10 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.330
 branch we took 67 meters and our intention 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.760
 is to get here 12 and 15 meters from 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.930
 height with wood says beloved or 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.930
 clean wood without knot 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.690
 there is a defined technique for 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.210
 the management of this cleaning we have 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.460
 appropriate tools 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.930
 the responsible engineer to be 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.150
 condition that this condition be well 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.650
 this is connected and if this 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.260
 three branches 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.030
 time is also connected to the way that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.760
 You did in your forest of woods. 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.730
 competition of fertilization and 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.550
 There is a technical all genetic coupled 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.020
 to this process the right and follow 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.450
 all the steps 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.820
 but there is still a producer who insists on going 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.430
 The hard way is very common. 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.770
 you enter an area as desra 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.940
 marinating all waters is not a 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.490
 correct technique because you will 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.770
 lead a planted forest in the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.830
 spacing three by three or thousand 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.860
 one hundred and eleven trees per hectare 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.730
 reached the final cycle with 250 300 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.920
 maximum number of trees in the first 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.320
 withdrawal we make 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.940
 We'll do it, we'll get more or 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.910
 200 300 trees less than 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.940
 booth 2111 these 300 trees 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.590
 will be discarded trees for energy 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.350
 wood that will turn legend will turn 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.810
 coal so there's no need you do 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.460
 make this division so it's important 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.980
 a professional accompanying the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.010
 forest development says pomegranate 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.510
 I would say that today it became a fad 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.790
 if you spend in most 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.640
 properties of the small owner it 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.000
 will do this says rosana because he saw 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.780
 that someone is doing now did not have to 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.820
 curiosity or did not take care of 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.560
 look for a professional and be oriented 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.850
 why because the samba effect with 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.740
 consequence that this will bring if I 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.260
 do not make that vision 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.520
 if I do not do the thinning one is lack of 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.510
 knowledge and pop 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.630
 sometimes we even talk about the 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.310
 building the owner pay a 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.190
 consulting or wanted one with a 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.810
 gabaritado one professional to give you 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.970
 this dollar orientation if this is this 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.790
 technical knowledge that you have a 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.580
 productivity greater value on their outside 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.690
 so much care will guarantee a wood 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.850
 Of Quality 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.130
 in the next program you will understand the 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.200
 which is solid wood and why this 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.860
 activity is attracting more and more 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.860
 investors 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.800
 who plants eucalyptus cole money but 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.580
 It's not plant replanting with anyone who understands 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.570
 reforestation environment to seriousness 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:06:00.400
 professionalism and high technology 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.490
 call now to 67 3026 17 00 and do it now 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.930
 your project 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:10.849
 the reforestation environment 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.849
 uniform and productive forest
