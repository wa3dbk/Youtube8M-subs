the measurement I'll go ahead and strike
the<00:01:41.819> face<00:01:41.969> on<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.279> here<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> crown

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
the face on this right here is my crown

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.729 
the face on this right here is my crown
stop<00:01:46.679> I<00:01:46.919> put<00:01:47.489> this<00:01:47.609> upside<00:01:48.060> down<00:01:48.169> and<00:01:49.169> I<00:01:49.439> set<00:01:49.709> it

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
stop I put this upside down and I set it

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.580 
stop I put this upside down and I set it
on<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.039> saw<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.909> where<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> perfectly

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
on my saw to where this is perfectly

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.409 
on my saw to where this is perfectly
flush<00:01:52.950> against<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.549> fence<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.969> the<00:01:54.029> back<00:01:54.209> of

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
flush against my fence in the back of

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.300 
flush against my fence in the back of
this<00:01:54.599> if<00:01:55.139> it's<00:01:55.409> turned<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.159> bit

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this if it's turned a little bit

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.999 
this if it's turned a little bit
sideways<00:01:56.749> your<00:01:57.749> cuts<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.590> good

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sideways your cuts not going to be good

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.519 
sideways your cuts not going to be good
that's<00:01:59.340> why<00:01:59.669> I<00:01:59.999> like<00:02:00.509> crown<00:02:00.779> stops<00:02:01.139> because<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529 
that's why I like crown stops because it

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:03.979 
that's why I like crown stops because it
keeps<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:01.859> tight<00:02:02.309> and<00:02:02.579> exact<00:02:03.119> every<00:02:03.569> time<00:02:03.779> so

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
keeps it tight and exact every time so

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.859 
keeps it tight and exact every time so
when<00:02:04.109> I<00:02:04.139> took<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.380> tape<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:05.399> next<00:02:05.729> piece<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.239> cut

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
when I took my tape my next piece I cut

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.389 
when I took my tape my next piece I cut
it<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.380> match<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.889> one<00:02:08.069> because

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it it's going to match this one because

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.309 
it it's going to match this one because
they're<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.700> held<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> exact<00:02:09.509> same<00:02:09.720> spot

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
they're both held in the exact same spot

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.530 
they're both held in the exact same spot
my<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.340> piece<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:11.939> to<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.299> face

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
my first piece is going to be the face

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.080 
my first piece is going to be the face
it's<00:02:12.989> 36<00:02:13.530> inches<00:02:13.709> wide<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:14.969> go

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it's 36 inches wide so I'm going to go

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.350 
it's 36 inches wide so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.569> make<00:02:15.780> an<00:02:15.930> outside<00:02:16.290> cut<00:02:16.590> right<00:02:16.769> now

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
ahead and make an outside cut right now

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.410 
ahead and make an outside cut right now

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
put my 45 degrees and remember this if

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.330 
put my 45 degrees and remember this if
you<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> 90<00:02:22.110> degree<00:02:22.410> turn<00:02:22.440> you're<00:02:23.190> going

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.770 
it's off a little bit say you have 46
degrees<00:02:40.380> then<00:02:40.920> you're<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.670> 22<00:02:42.390> or

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
degrees then you're going to do a 22 or
23<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.460> do<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> 23<00:02:44.910> degree<00:02:45.300> cut

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
23 you're going to do a 23 degree cut

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.930 
23 you're going to do a 23 degree cut
and<00:02:45.930> two<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.740> those<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:47.160> match<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.820> give

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and two of those will match up and give

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.730 
and two of those will match up and give
you<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> 46<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.050> it's<00:02:49.200> off<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.590> could

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
you the 46 so if it's off you could

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.010 
you the 46 so if it's off you could
still<00:02:49.950> match<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.520> remember<00:02:51.300> my<00:02:51.450> goggles<00:02:51.900> this
