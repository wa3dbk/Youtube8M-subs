00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
once the tail section looks a little

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.670 
once the tail section looks a little
more<00:00:46.530> tidy<00:00:46.770> although<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.000> fond<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
more tidy although I'm not very fond of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
more tidy although I'm not very fond of
the<00:00:49.680> new<00:00:49.890> mud<00:00:50.640> guard<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> monsoons<00:00:52.050> it

the new mud guard for the monsoons it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
the new mud guard for the monsoons it
will<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.350> really<00:00:52.620> handy<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.370> sure<00:00:53.579> if

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
will be really handy but I'm not sure if

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
will be really handy but I'm not sure if
it<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.850> work<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.989> terms<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it will work that well in terms of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
it will work that well in terms of
aesthetics<00:00:55.980> biggest<00:00:56.489> update<00:00:56.789> comes<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
aesthetics biggest update comes from the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
aesthetics biggest update comes from the
blue<00:00:57.989> core<00:00:58.289> engine<00:00:58.739> technology<00:00:59.219> development

what<00:01:00.090> Yamaha<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.600> emphasize<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.530> two

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
what Yamaha is emphasize on these two

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
what Yamaha is emphasize on these two
models<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> giving<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> performance<00:01:03.510> by<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
models is giving you performance by the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
models is giving you performance by the
same<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.320> boosting<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.309> fuel<00:01:05.519> economy<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
same time boosting the fuel economy and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
same time boosting the fuel economy and
so<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.439> very<00:01:07.680> reason<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.100> power<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so for that very reason the power and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.190 
so for that very reason the power and
the<00:01:09.090> traffickers<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> actually<00:01:09.930> gone<00:01:10.080> down

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the traffickers have actually gone down

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.230 
the traffickers have actually gone down
as<00:01:10.530> compared<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> old<00:01:11.100> FZ<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.119> one

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
as compared to the old FZ so this one

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
as compared to the old FZ so this one
makes<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.630> 13<00:01:12.990> point<00:01:13.260> 1<00:01:13.439> PS<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.369> 12

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
makes about 13 point 1 PS and about 12

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
makes about 13 point 1 PS and about 12
point<00:01:14.790> 8<00:01:14.939> Newton<00:01:15.180> meters<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> torque<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.280> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
point 8 Newton meters of torque but the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
point 8 Newton meters of torque but the
good<00:01:17.460> news<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.210> weight<00:01:18.420> has<00:01:18.450> reduced

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
good news is that the weight has reduced

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.609 
good news is that the weight has reduced
as<00:01:19.259> well

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
as well

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.070 
as well
well<00:01:19.920> almost<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.460> 3<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> 3.5<00:01:20.970> kgs<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
well almost about 3 to 3.5 kgs and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
well almost about 3 to 3.5 kgs and
that's<00:01:23.009> mainly<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> new<00:01:23.820> frame<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that's mainly because the new frame and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.200 
that's mainly because the new frame and
the<00:01:24.750> new<00:01:24.930> engine<00:01:26.600> engine<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.210> completely

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the new engine engine it's a completely

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.469 
the new engine engine it's a completely
new<00:01:31.020> engine<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.860> scurry<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.490> combustion

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
frame also totally new developed this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.390 
frame also totally new developed this
model<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:14.980> don't<00:02:15.390> scope<00:02:16.390> not<00:02:16.930> only<00:02:17.380> pit<00:02:18.190> power

model we don't scope not only pit power
but<00:02:19.030> also<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.870> low<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.980> mid-range<00:02:21.400> torque

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
but also so low and the mid-range torque

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.720 
but also so low and the mid-range torque
better<00:02:22.480> than<00:02:22.780> current<00:02:23.140> one<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.560> also<00:02:24.310> after

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
better than current one and also after

port and the exhaust system okay totally
we<00:02:38.890> improve<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:40.470> took<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.740> really<00:02:41.980> short

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
we improve I took it for a really short

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.580 
we improve I took it for a really short
spin<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.790> couldn't<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.300> test<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.840> here<00:02:44.020> but

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
spin I couldn't really test it here but

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.990 
spin I couldn't really test it here but
my<00:02:44.770> initial<00:02:44.920> impressions<00:02:45.490> are<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.820> fuel

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
my initial impressions are that the fuel

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.730 
my initial impressions are that the fuel
injection<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.510> definitely<00:02:47.020> working<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.560> lot

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
injection is definitely working a lot

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.060 
injection is definitely working a lot
better

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
better

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.860 
better
the<00:02:48.280> bike<00:02:48.460> feels<00:02:48.820> really<00:02:49.300> smooth<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the bike feels really smooth the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.480 
the bike feels really smooth the
throttle<00:02:50.170> response<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.710> Lord<00:02:50.890> crisper<00:02:51.370> and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
throttle response the Lord crisper and

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.180 
throttle response the Lord crisper and
it's<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.510> lot<00:02:52.660> more<00:02:52.810> enjoyable<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.830> focus

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
it's a lot more enjoyable so the focus

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.570 
it's a lot more enjoyable so the focus
has<00:02:54.370> been<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:55.230> boost<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.440> mid-range<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.430> that

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
has been to boost the mid-range so that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.400 
has been to boost the mid-range so that
it's<00:02:58.120> ride<00:02:58.330> ability<00:02:58.690> especially<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's ride ability especially on the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.260 
it's ride ability especially on the
streets<00:02:59.680> what<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> bike<00:03:00.490> has<00:03:00.670> been<00:03:00.700> made<00:03:01.030> for

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
streets what this bike has been made for

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.210 
streets what this bike has been made for
is<00:03:01.480> even<00:03:01.930> better<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.800> seems<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.070> have

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
is even better and that seems to have

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.130 
is even better and that seems to have
improved<00:03:03.550> but<00:03:04.240> having<00:03:04.510> said<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.720> we<00:03:05.020> would

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
improved but having said that we would

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.990 
improved but having said that we would
like<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.320> test<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.830> back<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.640> back<00:03:06.790> with<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
like to test it back to back with the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.460 
like to test it back to back with the
old<00:03:07.239> versions<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.810> give<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.020> fair<00:03:08.290> idea

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
old versions to give you a fair idea

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
old versions to give you a fair idea
about<00:03:08.800> how<00:03:09.100> much<00:03:09.280> improvement<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.850> we

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
about how much improvement can we

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.840 
about how much improvement can we
actually<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.410> feels<00:03:11.770> almost<00:03:12.040> just<00:03:12.700> as

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
actually see but it feels almost just as

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.190 
actually see but it feels almost just as
powerful<00:03:13.060> if<00:03:13.450> not<00:03:13.600> better<00:03:13.720> than<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.050> old

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
powerful if not better than the old

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.670 
powerful if not better than the old
version<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.650> for<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:16.330> feel<00:03:16.870> Yama<00:03:17.530> has

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
version and for that I feel Yama has

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.410 
version and for that I feel Yama has
done<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.920> commendable<00:03:18.100> job<00:03:18.370> that's<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.209> take

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
done a commendable job that's a take

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.360 
done a commendable job that's a take
right<00:03:19.630> now<00:03:19.660> from<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> launch<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.800> we<00:03:21.160> cannot

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
right now from the launch and we cannot

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.150 
right now from the launch and we cannot
wait<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.730> get<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.000> bike<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.709> testing<00:03:23.709> to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
wait to get this bike for testing to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.770 
wait to get this bike for testing to
give<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.459> much<00:03:24.730> better<00:03:24.970> idea<00:03:25.239> about<00:03:25.390> how<00:03:25.600> it

give you much better idea about how it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.420 
give you much better idea about how it
