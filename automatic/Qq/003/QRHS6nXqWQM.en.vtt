is<00:00:06.340> we<00:00:06.670> put<00:00:07.270> the<00:00:07.390> kick<00:00:07.630> net<00:00:07.870> out<00:00:08.080> so<00:00:08.440> that<00:00:08.560> the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
is we put the kick net out so that the

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.850 
is we put the kick net out so that the
water<00:00:08.890> will<00:00:09.389> bring<00:00:10.389> the<00:00:10.540> debris<00:00:10.960> down<00:00:11.440> into

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
water will bring the debris down into

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.220 
water will bring the debris down into
the<00:00:11.980> net<00:00:12.220> and<00:00:12.580> we<00:00:13.330> kind<00:00:13.600> of<00:00:13.660> anchor<00:00:13.900> at<00:00:14.200> the

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
the net and we kind of anchor at the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.350 
the net and we kind of anchor at the
bottom<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.770> the<00:00:14.889> net<00:00:15.129> with<00:00:15.340> rocks<00:00:15.639> so<00:00:16.180> that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
bottom of the net with rocks so that

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.620 
bottom of the net with rocks so that
does<00:00:16.630> not<00:00:17.050> get<00:00:17.530> swept<00:00:17.890> under<00:00:18.039> Neath<00:00:18.340> it<00:00:18.630> then

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
does not get swept under Neath it then

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.980 
does not get swept under Neath it then
what<00:00:19.840> we<00:00:19.960> do<00:00:20.170> is<00:00:20.200> we<00:00:20.500> come<00:00:20.740> out<00:00:21.120> and<00:00:22.120> we<00:00:22.180> try<00:00:22.720> and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
what we do is we come out and we try and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.440 
what we do is we come out and we try and
reach<00:00:23.140> around<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.740> rocks<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.420> the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
reach around the rocks and the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.830 
reach around the rocks and the
difference<00:00:26.430> trick<00:00:27.430> bugs<00:00:27.760> we're<00:00:28.390> going<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.630> be

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
difference trick bugs we're going to be

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.700 
difference trick bugs we're going to be
living<00:00:29.380> right<00:00:30.010> underneath<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.610> rocks<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.889 

and<00:00:35.710> they'll<00:00:36.010> get<00:00:36.370> caught<00:00:36.670> in<00:00:37.059> our<00:00:37.329> kicking<00:00:37.660> up

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
and they'll get caught in our kicking up

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.989 
and they'll get caught in our kicking up
there<00:00:42.359> into<00:00:43.359> the<00:00:43.510> Browns<00:00:43.809> here<00:00:44.789> trick<00:00:45.789> your

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and depending on what different bugs you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:17.390 
and depending on what different bugs you
can<00:01:06.840> tell<00:01:07.050> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.710> career<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:17.160> bugs

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
can tell a lot about a career the bugs

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
can tell a lot about a career the bugs
that<00:01:17.550> we<00:01:17.700> find<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.270> tell<00:01:18.480> us<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.660> lot<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:18.840> a

that we find to tell us a lot about a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.100 
that we find to tell us a lot about a
creek<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.190> them<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.340> real<00:01:20.670> sensitive

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
creek some of them are real sensitive

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.770 
creek some of them are real sensitive
situation<00:01:22.220> some<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.430> bugs<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:24.390> leeches

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
situation some of the bugs like leeches

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.930 
situation some of the bugs like leeches
and<00:01:25.230> worms<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.950> lay<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:26.190> pretty<00:01:26.580> much<00:01:26.640> any

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
and worms and lay them pretty much any

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:50.270 
and worms and lay them pretty much any
kind<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.420> water<00:01:27.840> quality<00:01:49.130> algae<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> grow

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
kind of water quality algae to grow

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
kind of water quality algae to grow
every<00:01:50.850> creature<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.600> some<00:01:51.900> algae<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.890> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
every creature can have some algae in it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.040 
every creature can have some algae in it
and<00:01:54.110> too<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.320> algae<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.160> come<00:01:56.460> from

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
and too much algae can come from

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.570 
and too much algae can come from
different<00:01:58.050> nutrients<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.039> water<00:01:59.070> look

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
different nutrients in the water look

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.370 
different nutrients in the water look
for<00:01:59.820> lasers<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.300> pesticides<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.080> goes

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
for lasers and pesticides that goes

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.840 
for lasers and pesticides that goes
through<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.830> water

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.240

that's<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.070> dragonfly<00:02:48.790> larvae<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.560> bugs

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
that's a dragonfly larvae all the bugs

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.380 
that's a dragonfly larvae all the bugs
that<00:02:50.920> were<00:02:51.069> going<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.520> finding<00:02:51.850> here<00:02:52.270> in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
that were going to be finding here in

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.470 
that were going to be finding here in
the<00:02:52.480> creek<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:54.040> have<00:02:54.280> gills<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.300> they're

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the creek they have gills that they're

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.870 
the creek they have gills that they're
in<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.750> larval<00:02:56.200> form<00:02:56.620> kind<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
in the larval form kind of like a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.479 
in the larval form kind of like a
caterpillar<00:02:58.660> form<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.620> before<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.220> turns<00:03:00.400> into

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
caterpillar form of before it turns into

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.729 
caterpillar form of before it turns into
a<00:03:00.670> butterfly<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.140> form<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.470> these

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
a butterfly that's the form that these

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.380 
a butterfly that's the form that these
bugs<00:03:03.040> are<00:03:03.190> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.060> they<00:03:04.209> have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
bugs are going to be in and they have

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.910 
bugs are going to be in and they have
gills<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.230> we're<00:03:05.380> going<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.650> breathe<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
gills and we're going to breathe the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.900 
gills and we're going to breathe the
water<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.910> much<00:03:07.180> I'm<00:03:07.870> much<00:03:08.680> rice<00:03:09.010> around<00:03:09.670> here

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
water so much I'm much rice around here

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.340 
water so much I'm much rice around here
and<00:03:10.090> when<00:03:10.269> they<00:03:10.390> grow<00:03:10.570> up<00:03:10.660> they<00:03:11.050> were<00:03:11.200> actually

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
and when they grow up they were actually

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.280 
and when they grow up they were actually
become<00:03:11.890> flying<00:03:12.280> insects<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:14.140> around

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
become flying insects like we see around

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.280 
become flying insects like we see around
so<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.640> larval<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:16.300> one<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.870> this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
so this is the larval for one and this

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.470 
so this is the larval for one and this
is<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> dragonfly<00:03:18.100> larvae<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.060> all<00:03:19.239> know

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
is a dragonfly larvae so you all know

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.360 
is a dragonfly larvae so you all know
what<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.630> dragonfly<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.769> sing<00:03:21.010> them<00:03:21.160> flying

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
what a dragonfly is you sing them flying

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.130 
what a dragonfly is you sing them flying
around<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.600> what<00:03:22.780> they<00:03:22.900> look<00:03:23.110> like

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
around this is what they look like

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.979 
around this is what they look like
before<00:03:23.739> they<00:03:24.010> become<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.459> true<00:03:24.970> adult<00:03:25.329> so

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
before they become a true adult so

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.560 
before they become a true adult so
they're<00:03:26.170> pretty<00:03:26.610> neat<00:03:27.610> bugs<00:03:27.910> here's<00:03:28.329> an<00:03:28.480> even

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
they're pretty neat bugs here's an even

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.199 
they're pretty neat bugs here's an even
bigger<00:03:28.900> wonder<00:03:29.290> well<00:03:29.820> that's<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.940> skill

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
bigger wonder well that's a skill

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.150 
bigger wonder well that's a skill
dragonfly<00:03:31.750> larvae<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:37.560> dragonflies<00:03:38.560> they

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
dragonfly larvae and dragonflies they

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.590 
dragonfly larvae and dragonflies they
are<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:41.230> they're<00:03:41.410> moderately<00:03:41.980> sensitive

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
are think they're moderately sensitive

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.170 
are think they're moderately sensitive
so<00:03:43.600> they're<00:03:43.930> they're<00:03:44.110> pretty<00:03:44.410> good<00:03:44.940> thugs<00:03:45.940> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
so they're they're pretty good thugs to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.860 
so they're they're pretty good thugs to
find<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:48.010> our<00:03:48.340> little<00:03:48.670> fish<00:03:48.970> here<00:03:49.600> it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
find and our little fish here it's

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.380 
find and our little fish here it's
called<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.320> darter<00:03:50.940> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.250 

yeah<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.450> think<00:03:58.600> that's<00:03:58.870> going<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.050> be<00:03:59.170> an

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
yeah I think that's going to be an

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:11.520 
yeah I think that's going to be an
orange<00:03:59.560> throw<00:03:59.860> garter<00:04:02.190> yes<00:04:09.990> now<00:04:10.990> these<00:04:11.170> orange

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
orange throw garter yes now these orange

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.990 
orange throw garter yes now these orange

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
thread daughters they can get bigger

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.460 
thread daughters they can get bigger
than<00:04:13.210> this<00:04:13.270> then<00:04:13.690> probably<00:04:13.990> good<00:04:14.140> about<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
than this then probably good about the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.360 
than this then probably good about the
size<00:04:14.710> of<00:04:14.860> my<00:04:14.920> pinky<00:04:16.650> these<00:04:17.650> daughters<00:04:18.190> are

size of my pinky these daughters are

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.970 
size of my pinky these daughters are
going<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.670> be<00:04:18.790> living<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.470> riffles<00:04:20.470> right<00:04:20.769> here

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
going to be living in riffles right here

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.530 
going to be living in riffles right here
and<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.220> riffle<00:04:21.640> is<00:04:21.760> where<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> water<00:04:22.240> breaks

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
and a riffle is where the water breaks

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.960 
and a riffle is where the water breaks
over<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.960> rocks<00:04:23.170> and<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.460> going<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.820> be

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
over the rocks and this is going to be

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.090 
over the rocks and this is going to be
their<00:04:25.240> lives<00:04:25.450> habitat<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.260> live<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.680> because

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
their lives habitat to live in because

their lives habitat to live in because
he's<00:04:27.580> small<00:04:28.270> fish<00:04:28.720> they<00:04:28.990> have<00:04:29.170> no<00:04:29.380> swim

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
he's small fish they have no swim

he's small fish they have no swim
bladder<00:04:30.010> would<00:04:30.970> swim<00:04:31.270> bladder<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.840> it's<00:04:32.290> just

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
bladder would swim bladder is it's just

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.230 
bladder would swim bladder is it's just
kind<00:04:32.980> of<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.250> balloon<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:33.850> your<00:04:34.000> body

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
kind of like a balloon in your body

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.780 
kind of like a balloon in your body
that's<00:04:34.930> filled<00:04:35.290> with<00:04:35.410> air<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.400> helps<00:04:36.640> them

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
that's filled with air and it helps them

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.640 
that's filled with air and it helps them
to<00:04:36.910> float<00:04:37.180> that's<00:04:37.600> how<00:04:37.750> other<00:04:37.930> fish<00:04:38.260> float

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
to float that's how other fish float

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.700 
to float that's how other fish float
these<00:04:39.550> daughters<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.690> not<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:41.110> that<00:04:41.380> so

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
these daughters do not have that so

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.100 
these daughters do not have that so
they've<00:04:41.860> got<00:04:41.890> things<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.670> bottom<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:44.080> that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
they've got things on the bottom so that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.930 
they've got things on the bottom so that
is<00:04:44.320> why<00:04:44.470> they<00:04:44.650> need<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.980> live<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
is why they need to live in the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.930 
is why they need to live in the
shallower<00:04:46.330> water<00:04:46.720> because<00:04:47.650> otherwise<00:04:47.980> that's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
shallower water because otherwise that's

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.520 
shallower water because otherwise that's
just<00:04:49.150> going<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.420> be<00:04:49.480> kind<00:04:49.630> of<00:04:49.930> like<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.080> buffet

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
just going to be kind of like a buffet

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.350 
just going to be kind of like a buffet
for<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.860> bigger<00:04:51.130> fish<00:04:51.460> if<00:04:51.760> they're<00:04:51.940> in<00:04:51.970> deep

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
for the bigger fish if they're in deep

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.510 
for the bigger fish if they're in deep
pools<00:04:52.780> like<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.350> when<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> bigger<00:04:53.980> fish<00:04:54.280> can

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
pools like this when a bigger fish can

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.260 
pools like this when a bigger fish can
live<00:04:54.700> that's<00:04:55.690> why<00:04:55.900> they<00:04:56.050> stay<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> shallow

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
live that's why they stay in the shallow

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.640 
live that's why they stay in the shallow
water<00:04:58.290> also<00:04:59.290> on<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.520> side<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.760> their<00:05:00.970> body<00:05:01.650> you

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
water also on the side of their body you

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.010 
water also on the side of their body you
can<00:05:02.800> kind<00:05:02.980> of<00:05:03.190> look<00:05:03.400> at<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.760> fish<00:05:04.030> as<00:05:04.390> if<00:05:04.630> we've

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
can kind of look at the fish as if we've

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.840 
can kind of look at the fish as if we've
the<00:05:05.260> spins<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:07.630> can<00:05:07.810> get<00:05:07.930> away<00:05:08.020> from<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:08.380> bugs

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
the spins we can get away from the bugs

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.280 
the spins we can get away from the bugs
the<00:05:09.850> fins<00:05:10.090> on<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.390> side<00:05:10.570> of<00:05:10.600> its<00:05:10.840> body<00:05:10.900> is

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
the fins on the side of its body is

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.260 
the fins on the side of its body is
pretty<00:05:11.770> much<00:05:11.919> like<00:05:11.980> arms<00:05:12.580> it's<00:05:12.820> going<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.090> come

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
pretty much like arms it's going to come

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.240 
pretty much like arms it's going to come
out<00:05:13.330> from<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.690> side<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:14.080> its<00:05:14.200> body<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.740> it's

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
out from the side of its body and it's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.700 
out from the side of its body and it's
going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.730> move<00:05:15.970> around<00:05:16.330> in<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.810> rocks<00:05:17.110> that's

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
going to move around in the rocks that's

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.300 
going to move around in the rocks that's
how<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:17.919> moves<00:05:18.160> around<00:05:18.570> can't<00:05:19.570> float<00:05:20.310> so

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
how it moves around can't float so

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.140 
how it moves around can't float so
that's<00:05:21.580> an<00:05:21.730> aspect<00:05:21.910> darter<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:24.070> garters<00:05:25.000> our

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
that's an aspect darter and garters our

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.640 
that's an aspect darter and garters our
good<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.360> find<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:25.780> creeks<00:05:26.080> they're<00:05:26.350> pretty

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
good to find in creeks they're pretty

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.040 
good to find in creeks they're pretty
elusive<00:05:26.890> solution

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.120 

our<00:05:33.050> bugs<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.490> called<00:05:34.730> an<00:05:34.880> eighth<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:36.130> and

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
our bugs this is called an eighth I and

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.900 
our bugs this is called an eighth I and
these<00:05:37.490> are<00:05:37.700> very<00:05:37.910> good<00:05:39.640> that's<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.730> worst

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
these are very good that's the worst

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.720 
these are very good that's the worst
watch<00:05:41.230> these<00:05:42.230> are<00:05:42.410> mayflies<00:05:42.590> they<00:05:43.280> are<00:05:43.400> very

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
watch these are mayflies they are very

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.960 
watch these are mayflies they are very
sensitive<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.390> pollution<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:48.340> yeah<00:05:49.340> well

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
sensitive to pollution and yeah well

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.990 
sensitive to pollution and yeah well
they're<00:05:50.150> good<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.540> find<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:52.100> these<00:05:52.820> are

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
they're good to find and these are

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.670 
they're good to find and these are
sensitive<00:05:53.480> to<00:05:53.510> different<00:05:53.810> pollution<00:05:54.560> in<00:05:54.650> the

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
sensitive to different pollution in the

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.220 
sensitive to different pollution in the
water<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:56.180> different<00:05:57.190> if<00:05:58.190> we<00:05:58.250> get<00:05:58.580> too<00:05:58.790> much

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
water and different if we get too much

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.860 
water and different if we get too much
erosion<00:06:00.230> to<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.800> creek<00:06:01.570> consultations<00:06:02.570> and

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
erosion to the creek consultations and

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.130 
erosion to the creek consultations and
you<00:06:03.080> would<00:06:04.010> be<00:06:04.190> able<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.460> find<00:06:04.700> these<00:06:04.940> so<00:06:05.870> may

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
you would be able to find these so may

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.450 
you would be able to find these so may
sliced<00:06:06.500> up<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:06.920> find<00:06:07.220> they<00:06:07.790> have<00:06:07.970> deals<00:06:08.240> yes

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
sliced up to find they have deals yes

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.880 
sliced up to find they have deals yes
yeah<00:06:10.460> and<00:06:11.450> the<00:06:11.600> late<00:06:11.840> studied<00:06:12.290> in<00:06:12.410> here<00:06:14.890> every

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
yeah and the late studied in here every

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.700 
yeah and the late studied in here every
creek<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.250> going<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.640> leeches<00:06:17.410> this<00:06:18.410> is

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
creek is going to have leeches this is

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.300 
creek is going to have leeches this is
just<00:06:18.980> nature<00:06:20.410> Bradley<00:06:21.410> cuz<00:06:21.710> how<00:06:21.950> about<00:06:22.100> you

big<00:06:24.890> yeah<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.669> remember<00:06:26.390> you<00:06:27.380> know<00:06:30.880> he<00:06:31.880> just

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
big yeah I remember you know he just

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.530 
big yeah I remember you know he just
reaches<00:06:32.900> to<00:06:33.050> live<00:06:33.200> in<00:06:33.320> pretty<00:06:33.500> much<00:06:33.620> anything

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
reaches to live in pretty much anything

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.360 
reaches to live in pretty much anything
so<00:06:35.540> just<00:06:35.900> from<00:06:36.200> this<00:06:36.380> one<00:06:36.710> very<00:06:37.040> quick

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
so just from this one very quick

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.659 
so just from this one very quick
collection<00:06:38.180> we<00:06:38.360> have<00:06:38.390> a<00:06:38.600> sensitive<00:06:39.340> bug<00:06:40.340> the

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
collection we have a sensitive bug the

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.940 
collection we have a sensitive bug the
mayflies<00:06:41.150> we<00:06:41.870> have<00:06:42.020> an<00:06:42.140> intermediate<00:06:42.650> species

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
mayflies we have an intermediate species

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.610 
mayflies we have an intermediate species
of<00:06:43.340> dragonfly<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:44.300> we<00:06:44.840> have<00:06:44.990> a<00:06:45.020> pollution

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
of dragonfly and we have a pollution

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.840 
of dragonfly and we have a pollution
tolerable<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.640> leech<00:06:47.110> so<00:06:48.190> just<00:06:49.190> a<00:06:49.400> very<00:06:49.729> quick

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
tolerable the leech so just a very quick

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.909 
tolerable the leech so just a very quick
assumption<00:06:50.810> of<00:06:50.900> Jimmy<00:06:51.110> creek<00:06:51.440> it's<00:06:51.740> probably

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
assumption of Jimmy creek it's probably

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.700 
assumption of Jimmy creek it's probably
doing<00:06:52.250> really<00:06:52.430> well

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.010 

ha<00:06:56.710> subido<00:06:57.160> that's<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.790> air-breathing<00:06:58.630> one

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
ha subido that's the air-breathing one

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.990 
ha subido that's the air-breathing one
so<00:06:59.290> that<00:06:59.380> wouldn't<00:06:59.680> count<00:06:59.860> for<00:07:00.130> us<00:07:02.040> yes<00:07:03.040> Mary

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
so that wouldn't count for us yes Mary

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000 
so that wouldn't count for us yes Mary

January tiny ones even mom be ready cold
water<00:07:35.740> and<00:07:36.010> we'll<00:07:36.490> need<00:07:36.640> a<00:07:36.730> bug<00:07:36.940> collection

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
water and we'll need a bug collection

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.780 
water and we'll need a bug collection
the<00:07:38.380> bus<00:07:38.590> can<00:07:38.980> tell<00:07:39.160> us<00:07:39.280> a<00:07:39.370> lot<00:07:39.550> because

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 
the bus can tell us a lot because

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.790 
the bus can tell us a lot because
they're<00:07:40.180> actually<00:07:40.480> living<00:07:40.750> breathing<00:07:41.380> in

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
they're actually living breathing in

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.390 
they're actually living breathing in
this<00:07:41.980> water<00:07:42.250> and<00:07:43.560> so<00:07:44.560> their<00:07:44.740> lifespans

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 
this water and so their lifespans

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.430 
this water and so their lifespans
depending<00:07:45.910> on<00:07:46.030> the<00:07:46.150> bug<00:07:46.360> it's<00:07:46.870> usually<00:07:47.320> about

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 
depending on the bug it's usually about

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.460 
depending on the bug it's usually about
oil<00:07:48.040> of<00:07:48.310> three<00:07:48.580> to<00:07:48.700> five<00:07:48.910> months<00:07:49.270> so<00:07:50.140> they<00:07:50.290> can

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.470 
oil of three to five months so they can

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.560 
oil of three to five months so they can
tell<00:07:50.650> us<00:07:50.680> a<00:07:50.950> pretty<00:07:51.190> good<00:07:51.310> history<00:07:51.880> of<00:07:52.120> the

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.570 
tell us a pretty good history of the

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.170 
tell us a pretty good history of the
water<00:07:52.840> quality<00:07:53.110> over<00:07:53.590> this<00:07:53.710> month<00:07:54.040> will<00:07:54.970> come

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.180 
water quality over this month will come

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.600 
water quality over this month will come
out<00:07:55.360> about<00:07:56.260> every<00:07:56.500> five<00:07:56.740> years<00:07:57.010> a<00:07:57.130> new<00:07:57.310> fish

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.610 
out about every five years a new fish

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.430 
out about every five years a new fish
collection<00:07:58.030> we<00:07:58.420> just<00:07:58.600> did<00:07:58.690> a<00:07:58.720> fish<00:07:58.960> cooks<00:07:59.260> from

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 
collection we just did a fish cooks from

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.550 
collection we just did a fish cooks from
your<00:07:59.740> plans<00:08:00.190> yet<00:08:00.760> less<00:08:00.940> or<00:08:01.150> am<00:08:02.050> I<00:08:02.290> can't

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 
your plans yet less or am I can't

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.320 
your plans yet less or am I can't
remember<00:08:02.890> what<00:08:03.070> we<00:08:03.220> god<00:08:03.400> I<00:08:03.430> think<00:08:03.670> with<00:08:04.000> a<00:08:04.030> been

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330 
remember what we god I think with a been

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.870 
remember what we god I think with a been
decent<00:08:04.720> collection<00:08:04.870> and<00:08:05.500> the<00:08:06.310> lifespan<00:08:06.700> of

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:06.880 
decent collection and the lifespan of

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.570 
decent collection and the lifespan of
the<00:08:07.060> fish<00:08:07.420> could<00:08:08.170> be<00:08:08.320> a<00:08:08.350> couple<00:08:09.040> of<00:08:09.100> years<00:08:09.220> up

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:09.580 
the fish could be a couple of years up

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.060 
the fish could be a couple of years up
to<00:08:09.610> like<00:08:09.910> 20<00:08:10.240> years

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.070 
to like 20 years

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.380 
to like 20 years
so<00:08:11.400> they're<00:08:11.580> going<00:08:11.730> to<00:08:11.790> tell<00:08:12.000> us<00:08:12.150> and<00:08:12.300> even

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:12.390 
so they're going to tell us and even
