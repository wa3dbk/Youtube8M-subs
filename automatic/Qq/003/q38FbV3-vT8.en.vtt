00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
know if you can see it moving or not but

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.940 
know if you can see it moving or not but
it's<00:00:36.809> no<00:00:37.710> support<00:00:39.290> anywhere<00:00:40.290> except<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's no support anywhere except at the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's no support anywhere except at the
very<00:00:41.370> extreme<00:00:41.820> edges<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:43.590> both<00:00:44.280> sides<00:00:44.629> where

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
very extreme edges on both sides where

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180 
very extreme edges on both sides where
it's<00:00:45.809> framed<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.829> they<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it's framed in and then they put the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
it's framed in and then they put the
paneling<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.730> top<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> needed<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> put<00:00:49.680> my

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
paneling on top but I needed to put my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
paneling on top but I needed to put my
TV<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> location<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.440> reason<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
TV in this location and the reason that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.900 
TV in this location and the reason that
the<00:00:53.100> mount<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:54.020> where<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.699> when

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the mount is where it is is so that when

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.319 
the mount is where it is is so that when
it's<00:00:57.090> collapsed<00:00:57.660> against<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> wall<00:00:59.059> it's<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it's collapsed against the wall it's as

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.110 
it's collapsed against the wall it's as
tight<00:01:00.629> against<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.350> wall<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.890> possible<00:01:02.160> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
tight against that wall as possible so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
tight against that wall as possible so
it<00:01:03.210> doesn't<00:01:03.539> protrude<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.530> further<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it doesn't protrude out any further it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
it doesn't protrude out any further it
sticks<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.119> inch<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.570> fine

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
sticks out about an inch which is fine

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.670 
sticks out about an inch which is fine
it's<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.150> way<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
it's not in the way that way when it's

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.730 
it's not in the way that way when it's
fully<00:01:10.680> collapsed<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.000> against<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> wall

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
fully collapsed back up against the wall

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
fully collapsed back up against the wall
it's<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.130> tight<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> could<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.970> which

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's over as tight as it could be which

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.580 
it's over as tight as it could be which
means<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> footprint<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
means that's where the footprint of this

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.719 
means that's where the footprint of this
articulating<00:01:19.590> arm<00:01:19.770> mount<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> allows

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
articulating arm mount because it allows

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.630 
articulating arm mount because it allows
me<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> pull<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> move<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> around<00:01:22.640> now

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
me to pull it out and move it around now

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 
me to pull it out and move it around now
get<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.299> viewing<00:01:24.689> angle<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
get it to a better viewing angle and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.609 
get it to a better viewing angle and
closer<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.020> that's<00:01:28.020> where<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> had

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
closer if I want it that's where it had

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
closer if I want it that's where it had
to<00:01:28.770> live<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.820> trying<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> resolve<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to live and I was trying to resolve the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.760 
to live and I was trying to resolve the
problem<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.939> no<00:01:32.939> solid<00:01:33.750> anchor<00:01:33.960> points<00:01:34.470> here

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
problem of no solid anchor points here

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
problem of no solid anchor points here
so<00:01:35.189> here's<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.640> fix<00:01:35.960> took<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> three-quarter

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so here's my fix took a three-quarter

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
so here's my fix took a three-quarter
inch<00:01:37.590> piece<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> plywood<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> decent

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
inch piece of plywood kind of decent

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
inch piece of plywood kind of decent
birch<00:01:39.930> ply<00:01:40.229> sanded<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.159> garnished<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
birch ply sanded it up garnished it a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
birch ply sanded it up garnished it a
little<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.500> coach<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> spray<00:01:44.130> bar<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
little bit you coach the spray bar and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.620 
little bit you coach the spray bar and
there's<00:01:44.579> nothing<00:01:44.850> fancy<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
there's nothing fancy because it's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.440 
there's nothing fancy because it's
always<00:01:45.780> buried<00:01:46.229> behind<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.649> TV<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
always buried behind a TV and then I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.679 
always buried behind a TV and then I
counter<00:01:49.140> sunk<00:01:49.380> some<00:01:49.619> nice<00:01:49.799> holes<00:01:50.540> take<00:01:51.540> your

counter sunk some nice holes take your
time<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> measure<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.920> looks<00:01:53.130> nice<00:01:53.340> if

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
time to measure it so it looks nice if

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.880 
time to measure it so it looks nice if
you<00:01:53.700> want<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:55.229> space<00:01:55.500> them<00:01:55.710> pretty

the paneling is minimal depth I think it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.850

was only about an inch and a quarter or

was only about an inch and a quarter or
something<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.400> before<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.450> start

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
something like that before you start

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.060 
something like that before you start

inside<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.060> refrigerator<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:43.920> not

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
inside of the refrigerator so it's not

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.780

very<00:02:44.370> thick<00:02:44.520> right<00:02:45.000> there<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> had<00:02:47.760> very

very thick right there so I had very

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.140 
very thick right there so I had very
carefully<00:02:48.510> determined<00:02:49.550> what<00:02:50.550> would<00:02:50.700> work<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
carefully determined what would work and

collapsed<00:04:35.669> like<00:04:35.819> this<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.389> shove<00:04:36.719> it<00:04:36.749> in

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
collapsed like this and you shove it in

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.499 
collapsed like this and you shove it in
the<00:04:37.139> wall<00:04:37.349> you<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.490> have<00:04:38.580> enough<00:04:38.789> you

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
the wall you have to have enough you

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.640 
the wall you have to have enough you
have<00:04:39.779> to<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.229> enough<00:04:40.740> clearance<00:04:41.219> here<00:04:42.650> so

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
have to have enough clearance here so

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.010 
have to have enough clearance here so
that<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.069> goes<00:04:44.249> completely<00:04:44.610> inside<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.539> wall

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
that it goes completely inside the wall

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.700 
that it goes completely inside the wall
and<00:04:46.800> will<00:04:47.490> then<00:04:47.669> spring<00:04:48.090> open<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.650> have

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
and will then spring open so you have

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.820 
and will then spring open so you have
those<00:04:49.949> two<00:04:50.189> measurements<00:04:50.639> to<00:04:50.939> calculate<00:04:51.830> so

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
those two measurements to calculate so

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.439 
those two measurements to calculate so
that<00:04:53.039> when<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.400> shove<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.669> in<00:04:53.879> you<00:04:54.060> got<00:04:54.210> enough

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
that when you shove it in you got enough

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.110 
that when you shove it in you got enough
room<00:04:54.719> and<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.110> can<00:04:55.259> open<00:04:55.439> up<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.069> then<00:04:56.969> when

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
room and it can open up and then when

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.670 
room and it can open up and then when
you<00:04:57.210> tighten<00:04:57.569> it<00:04:57.659> down<00:04:57.689> you<00:04:58.110> don't<00:04:58.199> have<00:04:58.379> any

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
you tighten it down you don't have any

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.189 
you tighten it down you don't have any
too<00:04:59.370> much<00:04:59.520> excess<00:04:59.939> bolt<00:05:00.300> sticking<00:05:00.810> through

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
too much excess bolt sticking through

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.800 
too much excess bolt sticking through
that<00:05:01.439> might<00:05:01.650> collide<00:05:02.069> with<00:05:02.490> something<00:05:02.629> if<00:05:03.629> you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
that might collide with something if you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.809 
that might collide with something if you
have<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.020> depth<00:05:04.319> receptors<00:05:05.129> in<00:05:05.250> correct<00:05:05.550> length

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
have a depth receptors in correct length

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.249 
have a depth receptors in correct length
and<00:05:06.180> if<00:05:06.360> they<00:05:06.479> needed<00:05:06.689> they<00:05:06.900> could<00:05:07.080> have<00:05:07.169> been

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
and if they needed they could have been

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.200 
and if they needed they could have been
cut<00:05:07.469> off<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.680> little<00:05:07.949> bit<00:05:08.129> so<00:05:08.819> that<00:05:08.849> when<00:05:09.090> you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
cut off a little bit so that when you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.760 
cut off a little bit so that when you
screw<00:05:09.539> them<00:05:09.659> all<00:05:09.779> the<00:05:09.960> way<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.500> bolt

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
screw them all the way in the bolt

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:17.189 
refrigerator wall that would be bad so I

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.369 
refrigerator wall that would be bad so I
mounted<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.669> plywood<00:05:18.150> up<00:05:18.270> here<00:05:18.599> knowing<00:05:19.169> that

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
mounted the plywood up here knowing that

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.769 
mounted the plywood up here knowing that
this<00:05:19.620> would<00:05:19.830> give<00:05:19.979> me<00:05:20.009> a<00:05:20.129> solid<00:05:20.430> surface<00:05:20.909> where

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
this would give me a solid surface where

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.749 
this would give me a solid surface where
the<00:05:21.930> footprint<00:05:22.379> needed<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.710> be<00:05:22.889> and<00:05:23.129> then<00:05:23.729> I

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
the footprint needed to be and then I

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.879 
the footprint needed to be and then I
bored<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.419> holes<00:05:24.629> big<00:05:24.990> enough<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.289> these<00:05:25.589> big

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
bored the holes big enough for these big

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.899 
the TV which could be way out at the end
here<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:49.919> I'm<00:05:50.009> actually<00:05:50.159> pushing<00:05:50.699> down<00:05:50.879> on

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
here and I'm actually pushing down on

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.480 
here and I'm actually pushing down on
this<00:05:51.240> pretty<00:05:51.569> hard<00:05:51.949> putting<00:05:52.949> a<00:05:53.039> lot<00:05:53.219> of<00:05:53.250> weight

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
this pretty hard putting a lot of weight

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.240 
this pretty hard putting a lot of weight
on<00:05:53.729> there<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:55.259> think<00:05:55.469> I<00:05:55.529> could<00:05:55.589> bend<00:05:55.979> the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
on there and I think I could bend the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.300 
on there and I think I could bend the
mount<00:05:56.490> before<00:05:56.969> it<00:05:57.149> pulled<00:05:57.419> out<00:05:57.599> or<00:05:58.279> started<00:05:59.279> to

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
mount before it pulled out or started to

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.700 
mount before it pulled out or started to
give<00:05:59.520> way<00:05:59.669> up<00:05:59.819> here<00:06:00.089> so<00:06:00.870> gave<00:06:01.110> me<00:06:01.289> a<00:06:01.319> lot<00:06:01.680> of

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
give way up here so gave me a lot of

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.070 
give way up here so gave me a lot of
strength<00:06:02.159> for<00:06:02.849> three<00:06:03.149> anchor<00:06:03.509> points<00:06:03.930> which

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
strength for three anchor points which

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.469 
strength for three anchor points which
is<00:06:04.199> all<00:06:04.349> you<00:06:04.439> get<00:06:04.620> one<00:06:04.889> two<00:06:05.069> three<00:06:05.389> and<00:06:06.389> then

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
is all you get one two three and then

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:15.170 
is all you get one two three and then
we're<00:06:09.479> going<00:06:10.969> all<00:06:11.969> I<00:06:12.089> do<00:06:12.240> is<00:06:13.580> hang<00:06:14.580> my<00:06:14.729> TV<00:06:15.060> back

we're going all I do is hang my TV back
in<00:06:15.240> place<00:06:18.620> on<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.889> mount

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.170 

and<00:06:30.390> there's<00:06:30.750> a<00:06:30.840> little<00:06:31.310> there<00:06:32.310> is<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.490> screw<00:06:33.000> on

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
and there's a little there is a screw on

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.120 
and there's a little there is a screw on
the<00:06:33.300> back<00:06:33.420> of<00:06:33.630> it<00:06:33.750> here<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:34.170> see<00:06:34.860> it<00:06:34.950> or<00:06:35.040> not

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
the back of it here you see it or not

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.210 
the back of it here you see it or not
but<00:06:35.840> it's<00:06:36.840> typical<00:06:37.260> standard<00:06:37.530> kind<00:06:37.890> of<00:06:37.980> stuff

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
but it's typical standard kind of stuff

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.970 
but it's typical standard kind of stuff
just<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.940> tighten<00:06:39.210> down<00:06:39.710> really<00:06:40.710> don't<00:06:40.890> need

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
just to tighten down really don't need

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.770 
just to tighten down really don't need
to<00:06:41.100> show<00:06:41.250> you<00:06:41.310> that<00:06:41.400> it's<00:06:41.700> just<00:06:41.760> a<00:06:41.970> bolt<00:06:42.210> that

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
to show you that it's just a bolt that

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.320 
to show you that it's just a bolt that
