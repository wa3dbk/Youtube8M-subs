picks<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> camera<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.219> to

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
picks the camera on this so I'm going to

start showing you some pictures and some

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
start showing you some pictures and some
video<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:13.950> basically<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.370> ultra<00:00:14.759> pixel

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
video it so basically this ultra pixel

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.970 
video it so basically this ultra pixel
camera<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.630> 4<00:00:15.929> megapixel<00:00:16.529> camera<00:00:16.770> which<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
camera is a 4 megapixel camera which is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250 
camera is a 4 megapixel camera which is
very<00:00:17.039> very<00:00:17.640> low<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.270> basically<00:00:18.930> anything

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
very very low for it basically anything

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.290 
very very low for it basically anything
right<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.189> toaster<00:00:20.640> has<00:00:20.970> more

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
right now I think my toaster has more

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
right now I think my toaster has more
megapixels<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> most<00:00:23.100> part

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
megapixels but for the most part

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
megapixels but for the most part
HTC<00:00:23.880> says<00:00:24.119> they're<00:00:24.330> ultra<00:00:24.600> pixels<00:00:24.990> mean<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
HTC says they're ultra pixels mean that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.109 
HTC says they're ultra pixels mean that
these<00:00:25.350> pixels<00:00:25.680> are<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.250> bigger<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
these pixels are going to be bigger so

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.160 
these pixels are going to be bigger so
this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.330> gonna<00:00:27.420> allow<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> camera<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
this is gonna allow the camera to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
this is gonna allow the camera to
capture<00:00:28.470> anymore<00:00:29.070> license<00:00:29.519> gonna<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.789> better

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
capture anymore license gonna be better

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
capture anymore license gonna be better
for<00:00:30.210> low-light<00:00:30.539> shooting<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.560> took<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
for low-light shooting so I took this

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.530 
for low-light shooting so I took this
thing<00:00:32.009> outside<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.610> did<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:32.910> outdoor<00:00:33.210> shots

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
thing outside the did some outdoor shots

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
thing outside the did some outdoor shots
and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.989> pretty<00:00:34.260> impressed<00:00:34.620> too<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:35.370> with

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and I was pretty impressed too with with

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.250 
and I was pretty impressed too with with
what<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.969> able<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.600> HTC<00:00:37.050> One

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
what I was able to get with this HTC One

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
what I was able to get with this HTC One
even<00:00:37.559> though<00:00:37.680> again<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.070> only<00:00:38.129> 4<00:00:38.370> megapixels

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
even though again it's only 4 megapixels

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.819 
even though again it's only 4 megapixels
on<00:00:39.120> paper<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.290> camera<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.710> definitely

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
on paper but this camera is definitely

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
on paper but this camera is definitely
delivering<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> goods<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
different situations and even up close

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
different situations and even up close
some<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> macro<00:00:44.969> shots<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> did<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
some of the macro shots it did do a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
some of the macro shots it did do a
really<00:00:46.140> good<00:00:46.260> job<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.739> well<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> also<00:00:47.489> could<00:00:47.789> be

I went indoors I mean a low-light shot

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
I went indoors I mean a low-light shot
here<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.469> dog<00:01:01.680> gadget<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.850> HTC<00:01:03.270> One<00:01:03.449> was

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
here of my dog gadget the HTC One was

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
here of my dog gadget the HTC One was
able<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> capture<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.070> bring<00:01:05.220> more

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
able to capture more like and bring more

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
able to capture more like and bring more
light<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> picture<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
light into the picture so you can see a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140 
light into the picture so you can see a
lot<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.110> detail<00:01:07.310> where<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> iPhone<00:01:08.760> 5s

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
lot more detail where the iPhone 5s

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
lot more detail where the iPhone 5s
picture<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.470> dark

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
picture was just really really dark

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
picture was just really really dark
compared<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> HTC<00:01:12.479> one's<00:01:12.720> picture<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> as

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
compared to the HTC one's picture and as

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.899 
compared to the HTC one's picture and as
far<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> video<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.310> camera<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> capture

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
far as the video this camera can capture

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.450 
far as the video this camera can capture
1080p<00:01:15.270> HD<00:01:16.020> video<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.409> 30<00:01:16.590> frames<00:01:16.680> per<00:01:17.009> second

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
1080p HD video at 30 frames per second

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
1080p HD video at 30 frames per second
and<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:17.970> even<00:01:18.119> capture<00:01:18.659> HDR<00:01:19.380> video

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and it can be even capture HDR video

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
and it can be even capture HDR video
because<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> does<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> quad<00:01:20.820> core

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
because it does have a quad core

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
because it does have a quad core
processor<00:01:21.450> inside<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
processor inside of there it can do a
