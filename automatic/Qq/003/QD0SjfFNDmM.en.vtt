00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
available for this phone because of the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.920 
available for this phone because of the

ram it has 256 megabytes of ram i think
and<00:00:28.310> that's<00:00:29.310> why<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.179> compatible<00:00:30.599> with

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and that's why it is not compatible with

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.560 
and that's why it is not compatible with
this<00:00:31.830> phone<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:33.410> some<00:00:34.410> days<00:00:34.559> ago<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.130> have

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
does work it does work perfectly as you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.179 
does work it does work perfectly as you

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
could see so everything loads fast at

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
could see so everything loads fast at
least<00:01:57.380> fast<00:01:58.380> enough<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.030> i<00:02:00.350> will<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.560> this

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

support<00:02:21.360> also<00:02:21.569> supported<00:02:26.720> okay<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.930> quality

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
support also supported okay the quality

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.370 
support also supported okay the quality
is<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.980> best<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.580> phone<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.380> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
is not the best on this phone but it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.280 
is not the best on this phone but it
does<00:02:31.830> work<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.580> could<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.299> doesn't<00:02:34.019> lag

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
does work as we could see it doesn't lag

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.900 
does work as we could see it doesn't lag
and<00:02:34.670> i<00:02:35.670> don't<00:02:36.180> know<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
and i don't know if this is if the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.300 
and i don't know if this is if the
camera<00:02:39.299> will<00:02:39.450> work<00:02:39.720> too<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.290> haven't<00:02:41.040> seen

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
camera will work too I haven't seen

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.289 
camera will work too I haven't seen
anything<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.360> bye<00:02:42.690> bye<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.549> think<00:02:44.700> so

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
anything now bye bye now but I think so

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.440 
anything now bye bye now but I think so
and<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:46.530> don't<00:02:46.860> understand<00:02:47.430> why<00:02:47.760> Microsoft

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and I don't understand why Microsoft

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.229 
and I don't understand why Microsoft
pull<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.079> app<00:02:49.349> from<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.130> market<00:02:50.250> place<00:02:50.849> for

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
pull this app from the market place for

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.069 
pull this app from the market place for
the<00:02:51.360> Lumia<00:02:51.690> 610<00:02:52.530> because<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.030> app<00:02:54.150> seems<00:02:54.810> to

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
the Lumia 610 because the app seems to

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.580 
the Lumia 610 because the app seems to
run<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.700> phone<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.390> think<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:58.230> users

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
run on the phone and I think the users

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.130 
run on the phone and I think the users
should<00:02:59.069> decide<00:02:59.459> themselves<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.329> they<00:03:00.780> should

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
should decide themselves if they should

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.839 
should decide themselves if they should
run<00:03:01.920> or<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.489> they<00:03:02.670> could<00:03:02.940> run<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.720> app<00:03:04.849> thanks

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
run or if they could run this app thanks

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.040
