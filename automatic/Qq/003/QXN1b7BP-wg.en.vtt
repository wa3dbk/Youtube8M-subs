put<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.670> one<00:02:01.790> side<00:02:04.060> you're<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> big

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
put this to one side you're the big

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.900 
put this to one side you're the big
crown<00:02:05.750> there<00:02:06.020> which<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.280> when<00:02:07.460> pilots

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
crown there which is for when pilots

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
crown there which is for when pilots
like<00:02:08.119> their<00:02:08.330> leather

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
like their leather

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.630 
like their leather
flying<00:02:09.410> gloves<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:10.040> they<00:02:10.130> won't<00:02:10.280> wind<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
flying gloves on if they won't wind the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.920 
flying gloves on if they won't wind the
watch<00:02:10.790> they<00:02:11.030> need<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.240> big<00:02:11.420> crown<00:02:11.690> then<00:02:11.840> they

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
watch they need a big crown then they

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.640 
watch they need a big crown then they
can<00:02:12.140> they<00:02:12.890> can<00:02:13.070> use<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.580> go<00:02:13.670> out<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
can they can use they can go out of the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.320 
can they can use they can go out of the
dial<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.370> nice<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.760> flare

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
dial really nice and flare

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
dial really nice and flare
you<00:02:17.630> know<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> bezel<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.230> really<00:02:18.620> thin<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.130> it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
you know the bezel is really thin so it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.080 
you know the bezel is really thin so it
kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> gives<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> watch<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:20.060> a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
kind of gives to the watch like a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.570 
kind of gives to the watch like a
imposing<00:02:20.930> look<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.500> because<00:02:21.650> how<00:02:22.250> much<00:02:22.430> of

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
imposing look just because how much of

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.990 
imposing look just because how much of
the<00:02:22.700> watch<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.150> dial<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.280> boxer<00:02:25.580> sights<00:02:25.820> we

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the watch is dial the boxer sights we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.870 
the watch is dial the boxer sights we
can<00:02:26.120> get<00:02:26.240> some<00:02:26.360> more<00:02:26.480> light<00:02:26.690> here<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:28.730> got<00:02:28.850> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
can get some more light here it's got a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.420 
can get some more light here it's got a
seven-day<00:02:29.330> power<00:02:29.630> reserve<00:02:30.050> which<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.710> which

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
seven-day power reserve which is which

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.570 
seven-day power reserve which is which
is<00:02:31.610> also<00:02:31.790> pretty<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:33.260> impressive<00:02:33.770> also<00:02:34.490> they

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
is also pretty very impressive also they

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.850 
is also pretty very impressive also they
got<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> case<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.480> got<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> space<00:02:36.620> in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
got the case and this got the space in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.500 
got the case and this got the space in
the<00:02:37.010> case<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.370> be<00:02:37.460> able<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.610> have<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.210> big

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the case to be able to have a big

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.900 
the case to be able to have a big
mainspring<00:02:39.490> interesting<00:02:40.490> thing<00:02:40.610> about<00:02:40.670> this

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
mainspring interesting thing about this

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.270 
mainspring interesting thing about this
watch<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.170> power<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.530> over<00:02:42.800> seven<00:02:43.130> days

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
watch is the power is over seven days

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.030 
watch is the power is over seven days
and<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.120> problems<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.450> our<00:02:44.600> face

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and one of the problems that our face

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.550 
and one of the problems that our face
watches<00:02:46.040> with<00:02:46.370> big<00:02:46.790> power<00:02:47.030> reserves<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
watches with big power reserves is the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.670 
watches with big power reserves is the
the<00:02:49.010> change<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.520> level<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.970> torque<00:02:50.300> between

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the change in level of torque between

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.500 
the change in level of torque between
when<00:02:51.680> s<00:02:51.830> mainspring<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.490> fully<00:02:52.730> round<00:02:53.120> versus

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
when s mainspring is fully round versus

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.910 
when s mainspring is fully round versus
when<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.810> starts<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.710> when<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
when it starts to you know when it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.960 
when it starts to you know when it
starts<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.600> wind<00:02:56.600> down<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:57.490> it's<00:02:58.490> so<00:02:58.640> great

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
starts and wind down is it's so great

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.170 
starts and wind down is it's so great
than<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.840> cause<00:03:00.080> timing<00:03:00.680> issues

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
than it can cause timing issues

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.710 
than it can cause timing issues
obviously<00:03:02.180> if<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.690> regular

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
obviously if you have just a regular

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.979 
obviously if you have just a regular
like<00:03:03.200> 44<00:03:03.709> our<00:03:03.890> mainspring<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:05.330> the

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
like 44 our mainspring the the

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.960 
like 44 our mainspring the the
difference<00:03:06.410> between<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.800> fully<00:03:07.040> welded<00:03:07.580> as<00:03:07.850> it

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
difference between it fully welded as it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.580 
difference between it fully welded as it
unwinds<00:03:08.120> isn't<00:03:08.780> quite<00:03:08.930> pronounced<00:03:09.320> words

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
unwinds isn't quite pronounced words

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.229 
unwinds isn't quite pronounced words
when<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:09.860> have<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.040> seven-day<00:03:10.670> power<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.060> well

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
when you have a seven-day power as well

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.770 
when you have a seven-day power as well
is<00:03:11.360> huge<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.850> there's<00:03:13.850> different<00:03:14.030> methods<00:03:14.450> of

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
is huge so there's different methods of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.210 
is huge so there's different methods of
getting<00:03:14.900> reality<00:03:15.320> like<00:03:15.530> constant<00:03:16.010> force

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
getting reality like constant force

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.630 
getting reality like constant force
escapements<00:03:17.590> longer<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.739> sauna<00:03:18.980> they<00:03:19.459> have

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
escapements longer and sauna they have

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.960 
escapements longer and sauna they have
their<00:03:19.820> 31<00:03:20.360> day<00:03:20.570> watch<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.580> they<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.760> like<00:03:22.940> a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
their 31 day watch and they have like a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.120 
their 31 day watch and they have like a
system<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.110> they<00:03:24.200> devise<00:03:24.500> themselves

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
system that they devise themselves

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.790 
system that they devise themselves
there's<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.820> fuse<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.959> chain<00:03:27.200> which<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.620> a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
there's a fuse a and chain which is a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.770 
there's a fuse a and chain which is a
way<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.280> delivering<00:03:28.670> constant<00:03:29.330> force<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
way of delivering constant force to the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.410 
way of delivering constant force to the
escapement<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:31.550> normally<00:03:31.850> find<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.209> kind

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
escapement you normally find that kind

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.570 
escapement you normally find that kind
of<00:03:32.480> thing<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:32.840> way<00:03:33.500> more<00:03:33.530> expensive<00:03:34.220> watches

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
of thing on way more expensive watches

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.170 
of thing on way more expensive watches
than<00:03:34.850> this

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
than this

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.650 
than this
so<00:03:36.170> what<00:03:36.950> IWC<00:03:37.489> did<00:03:37.700> i<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:38.030> was<00:03:38.120> quite<00:03:38.360> clever

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
so what IWC did i think was quite clever

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.830 
so what IWC did i think was quite clever
they<00:03:39.440> they<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.430> stopped<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.209> watch<00:03:41.360> out

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
they they just stopped the watch out

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.949 
they they just stopped the watch out
after<00:03:42.170> 168<00:03:42.890> hours<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.600> seven-day

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
after 168 hours so it's a seven-day

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.430 
after 168 hours so it's a seven-day
powers<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:46.780> actually<00:03:47.780> technically<00:03:48.140> sorry

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
powers of but actually technically sorry

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.710 
powers of but actually technically sorry
the<00:03:48.680> mainspring<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.400> think<00:03:49.610> technically<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.120> an

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
the mainspring I think technically is an

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.140 
the mainspring I think technically is an
eight-day<00:03:51.050> power<00:03:51.290> reserve<00:03:51.670> but<00:03:52.670> they<00:03:52.940> can't

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
eight-day power reserve but they can't

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.330
