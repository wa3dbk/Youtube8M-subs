00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.500
 use armored vehicles without coming close to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420

 the destruction of militants in the city is good 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.569
 Shilka fits 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.610
 but she is lightly armored can not 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.580
 perform combat missions with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.440
 building a hall close to a terrorist 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 allows the anti-aircraft installation to lead
