work up in business the important thing
to<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> change<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> morning

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
to do is to change it in the morning

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.539 
to do is to change it in the morning
don't<00:02:15.120> change<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.959> night<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.950> because

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
don't change it at night time because

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.390 
don't change it at night time because
it's<00:02:17.790> gearing<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.329> for<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.260> date<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:19.920> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's gearing up for the date change so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.780 
it's gearing up for the date change so
that's<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:21.419> our<00:02:21.780> Patek<00:02:22.260> change<00:02:22.949> their

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that's that's our Patek change their

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.530 
that's that's our Patek change their
and<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.290> reverso<00:02:26.950> example<00:02:27.549> here<00:02:27.909> we're

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and on this reverso example here we're

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.209 
and on this reverso example here we're
going<00:02:28.719> to<00:02:28.840> pretend<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.319> it's<00:02:29.590> seven<00:02:30.069> o'clock

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
going to pretend that it's seven o'clock

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.780 
going to pretend that it's seven o'clock
at<00:02:30.700> night<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.709> instead<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.099> using<00:02:33.219> the<00:02:33.609> quick

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
at night so instead of using the quick

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.229 
at night so instead of using the quick
set<00:02:34.090> function<00:02:34.439> it's<00:02:35.439> much<00:02:35.829> better<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.489> wind

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
set function it's much better to wind

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.110 
set function it's much better to wind
the<00:02:37.569> watch<00:02:37.750> manually<00:02:39.719> to<00:02:40.719> advance<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.379> date

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the watch manually to advance the date

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.509 
the watch manually to advance the date
because<00:02:43.120> we've<00:02:43.720> left<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.170> until<00:02:44.409> nighttime<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
because we've left it until nighttime so

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.780 
because we've left it until nighttime so
if<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.329> if<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.109> quick<00:02:47.379> set<00:02:47.650> only<00:02:48.250> use

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
if you if you have a quick set only use

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.839 
if you if you have a quick set only use
it<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.480> am<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:50.230> before<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:51.280> know<00:02:51.459> nine

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
triple date because a triple date would

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.399 
triple date because a triple date would
