00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.800
 Dear friends, 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.040
 The new year could hardly start better for Opel. 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.520
 In January we managed to increase our sales in Germany by nine percent. 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.480
 Key to this success is our product offensive. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.040
 Proof of this is the volume of orders: 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 130,000 for the ADAM family and 110,000 for the new Corsa. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.780
 And we have already begun the next stage of our model offensive. 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 ADAM S and Corsa OPC show that we are producing great cars. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 The awards we have received recently are also fueling our optimism. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.360
 Since the beginning of the year we have won 18 first prizes. Some 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.920
 Some of them can be found here: 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240
 We are leading in the field of automotive connectivity. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.980
 As you know in the future, every Opel will become a mobile Wi-Fi point with Opel OnStar. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.640
 That's why we got the Autobild Connected Car at the Detroit Auto Show. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.380
 Opel ADAM has one after another victories. 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.420
 Our ADAM won the Readers' Prize "The Best Cars" by the specialist magazine motor motor und sport 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.800
 with over 112,000 votes in the mini-car segment. 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.140
 Additionally, two Opel models took first place as price-performance champions. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 Opel ADAM won the Wertmeister 2015 in the category of small cars and the Opel Zafira won the category of compact vans. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.500
 Our advertising campaign Umparken im Kopf won the Grand Prix of the Year of Advertising forum 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.780
 for the best campaign of the year. 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.460
 But I am particularly happy that our new Corsa is about to become a bestseller again. 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.340
 For example, the new Corsa was named the Most Sensible Car 2015 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.300
 of the Guter Rat magazine and the SUPERillu lifestyle magazine. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.420
 Corsa also secured its first place in other European countries. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.900
 In Romania and Serbia she won the prestigious Car of the Year award. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.240
 In Spain, Corsa won the Car of the Year award in TV. 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.120
 In Denmark, our popular model has become Best Car in its class. 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.760
 And on 19 February I look forward to something really great. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.240
 The AutoBest Award Ceremony in Zagreb. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.600
 Then I will accept the prize for the most recommended car purchase in Europe for our new Corsa. 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.480
 This award makes me particularly proud because the jury, consisting of specialists from 15 Central and Eastern European countries, 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680
 confirmed that we have the best small car on the market. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.100
 Only cars with exceptional characteristics, combined with a good price for their qualities, can win this prize. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.940
 The award is very prestigious in markets that have a total of about 300 million people. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.840
 All of this will give our sales even greater impetus. 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 As you can see, Opel was successful and made an excellent start in the New Year. 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.240
 I can promise you that I will have more exciting news for you in my next video submissions. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.080
 Until recently, truly yours Karl-Thomas Neumann
