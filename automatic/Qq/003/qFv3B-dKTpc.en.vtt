00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
and I took along with me the my zoom

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.870 
and I took along with me the my zoom
this<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> 28th<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.869> 135<00:00:31.679> he<00:00:32.279> knows<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.610> warm

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this is the 28th to 135 he knows a warm

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.500 
this is the 28th to 135 he knows a warm
hot<00:00:33.239> day<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.680> lots<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> sunshine<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.820> wanted

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
hot day and lots of sunshine so I wanted

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
hot day and lots of sunshine so I wanted
to<00:00:36.570> zoom<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> animals<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> stuff<00:00:37.829> like

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to zoom in on the animals and stuff like

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
to zoom in on the animals and stuff like
that<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> thought<00:00:38.879> I'd<00:00:39.030> bring<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> zoom<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that so I thought I'd bring the zoom so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
that so I thought I'd bring the zoom so
we<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.290> them<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:40.739> absolutely<00:00:41.129> no

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
we get them there's absolutely no

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
we get them there's absolutely no
parking<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> no<00:00:42.870> parking<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
parking there is no parking in the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.180 
parking there is no parking in the
garage<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:44.010> parking<00:00:44.399> anywhere<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.680> decided

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
garage no parking anywhere so we decided

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
garage no parking anywhere so we decided
to<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> aquarium<00:00:47.879> instead<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:49.050> Denver

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to go to the aquarium instead in Denver

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
to go to the aquarium instead in Denver
so<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> took<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.850> which<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> kind<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
so I took that and which is kind of a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.510 
so I took that and which is kind of a
mistake<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.739> didn't<00:00:52.949> bring<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.160> other

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
mistake because I didn't bring my other

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520 
mistake because I didn't bring my other
lens<00:00:53.820> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> my<00:00:54.360> 50<00:00:54.660> prime<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.170> works

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lens which is my 50 prime which works

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
lens which is my 50 prime which works
really<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.309> low<00:00:56.460> light<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.090> what

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
really well in low light and that's what

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.799 
really well in low light and that's what
the<00:00:57.899> aquarium<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.920> low<00:00:59.250> light

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
the aquarium is like it's all low light

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.029 
the aquarium is like it's all low light
so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.930> actually<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> disappointed

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so I was actually kind of disappointed

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
so I was actually kind of disappointed
when<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> lens<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.910> didn't<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.629> many

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
when this lens I didn't get very many

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.270 
when this lens I didn't get very many
good<00:01:03.960> shots<00:01:04.290> video<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.869> stills<00:01:07.189> before<00:01:08.189> we

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
like on fire with more a patterns so I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
like on fire with more a patterns so I
was<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.939> playing<00:01:30.329> around<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.659> an<00:01:30.780> extra

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
was just playing around with an extra

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
was just playing around with an extra
could<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.159> LCD

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
could see it on the back of my LCD

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.870 
could see it on the back of my LCD
screen<00:01:33.479> quite<00:01:33.720> well<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> started<00:01:35.369> bringing

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
screen quite well so I started bringing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.490 
screen quite well so I started bringing
down<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> sharpness<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.079> brought<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
down the sharpness and I brought all the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
down the sharpness and I brought all the
way<00:01:37.619> down<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> zero<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
way down to zero and this is what you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
way down to zero and this is what you
can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.229> helps<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:40.950> bit

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can see it actually helps a little bit

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
can see it actually helps a little bit
but<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.729> definitely<00:01:42.180> still<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.140> what

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
but it's definitely still there and what

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
but it's definitely still there and what
I'm<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> curious<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:45.360> transcode<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
I'm kind of curious is my transcode this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.639 
I'm kind of curious is my transcode this
