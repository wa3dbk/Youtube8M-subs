the<00:04:55.350> trick<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:56.040> we're<00:04:56.400> surveying<00:04:56.760> all

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the trick is because we're surveying all

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.360 
the trick is because we're surveying all
around<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> bay<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.170> we<00:04:58.530> do<00:04:58.680> multiple

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
around the bay and we do multiple

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.570 
around the bay and we do multiple
surveys<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:01.340> interpretation<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.430> what

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
surveys the interpretation of what

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.520 
surveys the interpretation of what
you're<00:05:02.700> seeing<00:05:02.820> really<00:05:03.150> comes<00:05:03.420> when<00:05:03.750> all<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
you're seeing really comes when all the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.710 
you're seeing really comes when all the
all<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.430> numbers<00:05:05.760> are<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.360> data<00:05:06.570> are

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
all the numbers are in and the data are

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.940 
all the numbers are in and the data are
looked<00:05:06.990> at<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.410> can<00:05:07.470> see<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.830> whole

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
looked at so you can see the whole

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.030 
looked at so you can see the whole
picture<00:05:08.100> that's<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> most<00:05:09.120> important<00:05:09.510> thing

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040
