00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
of the attack and each of those rocks

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.840 
of the attack and each of those rocks
that<00:00:40.750> pop<00:00:40.930> out<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.230> ground<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:42.579> up<00:00:42.670> 15

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
that pop out of the ground get up 15

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.730 
that pop out of the ground get up 15
targets<00:00:43.420> but<00:00:43.600> it's<00:00:43.810> probably<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.560> little

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
targets but it's probably in a little

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.920 
targets but it's probably in a little
less<00:00:44.830> likely<00:00:45.130> yeah<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.670> this<00:00:45.790> sex<00:00:45.970> skill<00:00:46.840> is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
less likely yeah so this sex skill is

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.920 
less likely yeah so this sex skill is
called<00:00:47.200> flames<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.340> war<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:49.270> what<00:00:49.660> if<00:00:49.720> it<00:00:49.780> does

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
called flames of war and what if it does

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.730 
called flames of war and what if it does
is<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.080> sets<00:00:50.380> you<00:00:50.500> on<00:00:50.530> fire<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:53.230> doesn't

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
is it sets you on fire it doesn't

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.070 
is it sets you on fire it doesn't
actually<00:00:53.920> put<00:00:54.730> burning<00:00:55.060> on<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.450> actually

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
actually put burning on you it actually

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.780 
actually put burning on you it actually
removes<00:00:56.350> conditions<00:00:56.860> because<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.400> fire<00:00:57.550> kind

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
removes conditions because the fire kind

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.880 
removes conditions because the fire kind
of<00:00:57.850> burns<00:00:58.030> away<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.420> conditions<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:59.740> it'd<00:00:59.830> be

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
of burns away the conditions and it'd be

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.650 
of burns away the conditions and it'd be
kind<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.100> silly<00:01:00.250> if<00:01:00.460> we<00:01:00.580> set<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.060> on<00:01:01.150> fire<00:01:01.180> it

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
kind of silly if we set you on fire it

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.720 
kind of silly if we set you on fire it
sets<00:01:01.960> your<00:01:02.530> character<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.100> fire<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.610> the

converted to healing normally and if you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.099 
converted to healing normally and if you
crit<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.939> converts<00:01:31.479> fifty<00:01:32.140> percent<00:01:32.380> geez

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
punching a fireball is yeah infinitely

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.849 
punching a fireball is yeah infinitely
cooler<00:03:21.389> so<00:03:22.389> this<00:03:22.480> next<00:03:22.599> one<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.230> called

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
cooler so this next one is called

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.009 
cooler so this next one is called
Sundering<00:03:24.250> leap<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:25.359> basically<00:03:25.569> just<00:03:25.780> lead

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
Sundering leap you basically just lead

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.309 
Sundering leap you basically just lead
to<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.230> location<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.949> everyone<00:03:27.909> at<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.079> point

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
to a location and everyone at the point

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.649 
to a location and everyone at the point
of<00:03:29.379> origin<00:03:29.620> at<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.310> target<00:03:30.669> point<00:03:30.909> gets<00:03:31.419> ten

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
of origin at the target point gets ten

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.110 
of origin at the target point gets ten
stacks<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.019> vulnerability<00:03:32.759> I'm<00:03:33.759> gonna<00:03:33.909> push

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
stacks of vulnerability I'm gonna push

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.149 
stacks of vulnerability I'm gonna push
your<00:03:34.269> chair<00:03:34.449> off<00:03:37.650> right<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:38.859> this<00:03:38.949> is<00:03:39.069> the

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
your chair off right and so this is the

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.849 
your chair off right and so this is the
elite<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.180> head<00:03:40.359> but<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.829> a

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
elite this is head but it is a

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.729 
elite this is head but it is a
short-range<00:03:42.579> dashing<00:03:43.120> attack<00:03:43.389> and<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.470> stuns

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
short-range dashing attack and it stuns

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.050 
short-range dashing attack and it stuns
the<00:03:44.859> enemy<00:03:45.069> for<00:03:45.189> three<00:03:45.340> seconds<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.849> stuns

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the enemy for three seconds and it stuns

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.550 
the enemy for three seconds and it stuns
you<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.389> one<00:03:46.509> second<00:03:48.629> it's<00:03:49.629> just<00:03:50.169> kind<00:03:50.439> of<00:03:50.470> a

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you for one second it's just kind of a

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.020

fun skill it's got a pretty low recharge
I<00:03:52.329> think<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.659> was<00:03:52.689> it<00:03:52.870> was<00:03:53.139> it<00:03:53.259> 20<00:03:53.889> 20<00:03:54.310> seconds

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
I think it was it was it 20 20 seconds

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
yeah it's a some 22 recharge so it's a

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.339 
yeah it's a some 22 recharge so it's a
really<00:03:56.769> strong<00:03:57.250> CC<00:03:57.970> on<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.269> short<00:03:58.959> recharge<00:03:59.259> but

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
really strong CC on a short recharge but

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.199 
really strong CC on a short recharge but
it<00:03:59.439> does<00:03:59.530> stun<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.949> uh<00:04:00.099> works<00:04:00.909> really<00:04:01.120> well

you<00:04:54.710> hit<00:04:54.830> guys<00:04:54.950> around<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.310> but<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:56.060> one

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
you hit guys around you but this one

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.370 
you hit guys around you but this one
this<00:04:56.270> one<00:04:56.420> does<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.660> creates<00:04:56.870> kind<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.110> this

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
this one does it creates kind of this

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.860 
this one does it creates kind of this
expanding<00:04:57.890> ring<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.070> fire<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.660> you<00:04:59.690> can

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
expanding ring of fire and you can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.090 
expanding ring of fire and you can
interact<00:05:00.320> with<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.530> ring<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.710> fire<00:05:00.860> again

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
interact with the ring of fire again

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.680 
interact with the ring of fire again
similar<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.730> how<00:05:01.820> Wars<00:05:02.090> premiere<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.420> can<00:05:02.570> fire

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
similar to how Wars premiere I can fire

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.240 
similar to how Wars premiere I can fire
fields<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.110> like<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.500> activate<00:05:03.920> this<00:05:04.010> one<00:05:04.160> then

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
fields I like to activate this one then

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.290 
fields I like to activate this one then
spin<00:05:04.520> through<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.910> get<00:05:05.000> some<00:05:05.150> extra

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
spin through it to get some extra

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.970 
spin through it to get some extra
burning<00:05:05.630> bolts<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.260> can<00:05:06.380> also<00:05:06.500> throw<00:05:06.800> your

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
burning bolts you can also throw your

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.680 
burning bolts you can also throw your
three<00:05:07.790> great<00:05:08.030> store<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.390> projectile

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
three great store to get a projectile

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.320 
three great store to get a projectile
finish<00:05:08.960> drop<00:05:09.110> off<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:09.470> that<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.910> we<00:05:11.060> get<00:05:11.210> to

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
finish drop off of that and we get to

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.640 
finish drop off of that and we get to
the<00:05:11.360> bulb<00:05:11.630> okay<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.140> this<00:05:12.320> is<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.470> boat

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
the bulb okay so this is the boat

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.340 
the bulb okay so this is the boat
obviously<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.250> worked<00:05:13.490> earth<00:05:14.170> this<00:05:15.170> one

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
obviously I worked earth this one

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.900 
obviously I worked earth this one
basically<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.740> fires<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.190> projectile<00:05:16.310> and

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
basically just fires a projectile and

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.600 
basically just fires a projectile and
there<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.420> a<00:05:17.450> trail<00:05:18.230> of<00:05:18.260> fire<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:19.220> goes<00:05:19.460> along

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
there is a trail of fire that goes along

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.080 
there is a trail of fire that goes along
with<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:20.230> this<00:05:21.230> one<00:05:21.380> it<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:22.070> one<00:05:22.250> acts<00:05:22.850> a

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
with it this one it this one acts a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.140 
with it this one it this one acts a
little<00:05:23.210> differently<00:05:23.660> than<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.320> standard<00:05:24.890> one

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
little differently than the standard one

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.420 
little differently than the standard one
you<00:05:26.150> know<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.480> arrow<00:05:27.410> itself<00:05:27.980> doesn't<00:05:28.190> really

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
you know the arrow itself doesn't really

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.790 
you know the arrow itself doesn't really
hit<00:05:28.700> but<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.600> fire<00:05:29.780> it's<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.290> fire<00:05:30.470> fields

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
hit but the fire it's the fire fields

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.990 
hit but the fire it's the fire fields
that<00:05:30.860> do<00:05:30.980> all<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.160> damage<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.550> fire<00:05:31.700> fields

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
that do all the damage the fire fields

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.280 
that do all the damage the fire fields
last<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.300> little<00:05:32.540> shorter<00:05:32.870> I<00:05:32.900> think<00:05:33.080> from<00:05:33.169> the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
last a little shorter I think from the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.030 
last a little shorter I think from the
match<00:05:33.440> duration<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:36.260> normal<00:05:36.650> longbow

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
match duration of the the normal longbow

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.270 
match duration of the the normal longbow
but<00:05:38.030> they<00:05:38.419> last<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.380> you<00:05:39.560> can<00:05:39.710> cast<00:05:39.980> this<00:05:40.130> one

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
but they last but you can cast this one

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.150 
but they last but you can cast this one
a<00:05:40.310> lot<00:05:40.460> more<00:05:40.640> often<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:42.020> also<00:05:42.200> covers<00:05:42.650> like<00:05:43.010> I

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
a lot more often it also covers like I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.420 
a lot more often it also covers like I
think<00:05:43.310> it's<00:05:43.400> like<00:05:43.490> six<00:05:44.770> radius<00:05:45.770> 120s<00:05:46.340> or

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
think it's like six radius 120s or

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.710 
think it's like six radius 120s or
something<00:05:46.640> like<00:05:46.730> that<00:05:46.790> it's<00:05:47.060> it's<00:05:47.419> like<00:05:47.510> it's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
something like that it's it's like it's

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.909 
something like that it's it's like it's
all<00:05:47.810> like<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.960> thousand<00:05:48.380> range<00:05:48.530> or<00:05:48.680> something

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
all like a thousand range or something

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.800 
all like a thousand range or something
like<00:05:48.980> that<00:05:49.040> this<00:05:49.790> is<00:05:49.940> this<00:05:50.210> is<00:05:50.360> great<00:05:50.600> this<00:05:50.750> is

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
like that this is this is great this is

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.350 
like that this is this is great this is
great<00:05:50.990> actually<00:05:51.290> not<00:05:51.680> just<00:05:51.919> for<00:05:52.040> PvP<00:05:52.520> but<00:05:53.210> else

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
great actually not just for PvP but else

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.090 
great actually not just for PvP but else
like<00:05:53.510> really<00:05:53.690> good<00:05:53.810> PVE<00:05:54.140> so<00:05:54.530> other<00:05:54.890> like<00:05:55.070> that

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
like really good PVE so other like that

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.180 
like really good PVE so other like that
so<00:05:56.030> this<00:05:56.150> is<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.360> rifle<00:05:56.720> shot<00:05:57.380> it's<00:05:57.650> pretty

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
so this is the rifle shot it's pretty

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.010 
so this is the rifle shot it's pretty
similar<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:59.000> old<00:05:59.030> one<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.510> doesn't<00:05:59.870> just

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
similar to the old one it doesn't just

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.530 
similar to the old one it doesn't just
do<00:06:00.229> damage<00:06:00.530> though<00:06:00.650> it<00:06:00.770> also<00:06:01.010> days<00:06:01.220> a--'s<00:06:01.540> and

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
do damage though it also days a--'s and

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.770 
do damage though it also days a--'s and
whenever<00:06:02.840> it<00:06:03.080> hits<00:06:03.350> a<00:06:03.470> target<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:04.040> explodes<00:06:04.780> so

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
whenever it hits a target it explodes so

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.670 
whenever it hits a target it explodes so
if<00:06:05.840> you're<00:06:05.930> running<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.200> piercing<00:06:06.530> trait

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
if you're running the piercing trait

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.719 
if you're running the piercing trait
which<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:06.890> am<00:06:06.979> here<00:06:07.160> you<00:06:07.250> can<00:06:07.370> get<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.490> lot<00:06:07.669> of

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
which I am here you can get a lot of

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.120 
which I am here you can get a lot of
hits<00:06:08.060> this<00:06:08.540> so<00:06:09.260> this<00:06:09.350> is<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.590> this<00:06:09.950> is<00:06:10.010> the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
hits this so this is the this is the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.900 
hits this so this is the this is the
mace<00:06:11.530> bursts<00:06:12.530> kill<00:06:12.710> this<00:06:12.860> is<00:06:13.070> called<00:06:13.400> a<00:06:13.610> skull

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
mace bursts kill this is called a skull

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.909 
mace bursts kill this is called a skull
grinder<00:06:14.290> it's<00:06:15.290> similar<00:06:15.410> scroll<00:06:15.710> cracka

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
grinder it's similar scroll cracka

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.260 
grinder it's similar scroll cracka
minute<00:06:16.100> interrupts<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.640> doesn't<00:06:16.910> do<00:06:17.000> the<00:06:17.090> same

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
minute interrupts it doesn't do the same

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.990 
minute interrupts it doesn't do the same
type<00:06:17.540> of<00:06:17.570> interrupt<00:06:18.100> but<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.220> applies<00:06:19.760> like<00:06:19.970> a

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
type of interrupt but it applies like a

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.370 
type of interrupt but it applies like a
lot<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.240> cases<00:06:20.390> like<00:06:20.600> it's<00:06:20.780> like<00:06:20.900> week<00:06:21.140> its

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
lot of cases like it's like week its

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.290 
lot of cases like it's like week its
weakness<00:06:22.300> crippled<00:06:23.300> blind<00:06:24.040> confusion<00:06:25.300> and

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
weakness crippled blind confusion and

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.600 
weakness crippled blind confusion and
days<00:06:26.840> a--'s<00:06:27.050> both<00:06:27.919> both<00:06:28.130> in<00:06:28.250> Europe<00:06:28.340> together

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
days a--'s both both in Europe together

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.280 
days a--'s both both in Europe together
this<00:06:28.790> is<00:06:28.880> pretty<00:06:29.060> powerful<00:06:29.150> yeah<00:06:29.510> this<00:06:30.050> is<00:06:30.169> the

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
this is pretty powerful yeah this is the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
and I love it it's it's very similar to

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.540

eviscerate it does a little less damage

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.060 
eviscerate it does a little less damage
but<00:06:55.910> after<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:56.960> hits<00:06:57.139> the<00:06:57.260> initial<00:06:57.590> target<00:06:57.919> it

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
but after it hits the initial target it

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.010 
but after it hits the initial target it
will<00:06:58.220> shock<00:06:58.550> wave<00:06:58.790> behind<00:06:59.210> that<00:06:59.449> target<00:06:59.900> and

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
will shock wave behind that target and

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.420 
will shock wave behind that target and
hit<00:07:00.169> additional<00:07:00.590> targets<00:07:00.830> behind<00:07:01.070> them

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
hit additional targets behind them

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.210 
hit additional targets behind them
what's<00:07:02.330> better<00:07:02.510> than<00:07:02.570> one<00:07:02.810> of<00:07:02.870> this<00:07:03.050> raid<00:07:03.290> 5

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220
