they took some consideration into the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.720 
they took some consideration into the
cap<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.540> looks<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.340> as<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.550> see

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.350 
a song candy keeps my face very very
matte<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:32.310> if<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.460> have<00:04:32.580> oily<00:04:32.910> skin<00:04:32.940> I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
matte so if you have oily skin I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.580 
matte so if you have oily skin I
probably<00:04:33.569> would<00:04:33.750> recommend<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.229> towards

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
probably would recommend this towards

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.520 
probably would recommend this towards
oily<00:04:34.889> skin<00:04:35.190> or<00:04:35.340> those<00:04:35.610> who<00:04:36.060> get<00:04:36.930> kind<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.229> shiny

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
oily skin or those who get kind of shiny

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.529 
oily skin or those who get kind of shiny
in<00:04:37.889> their<00:04:38.129> t-zone<00:04:38.520> area

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
in their t-zone area

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.230 
in their t-zone area
I<00:04:39.569> get<00:04:40.199> shiny<00:04:40.440> right<00:04:40.770> around<00:04:40.919> my<00:04:41.069> forehead<00:04:41.240> in

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
I get shiny right around my forehead in

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.899 
I get shiny right around my forehead in
my<00:04:42.360> nose<00:04:42.539> so<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.470> guess<00:04:43.979> it's<00:04:44.159> the<00:04:44.280> best<00:04:44.460> way<00:04:44.639> for

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
my nose so I guess it's the best way for

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.589 
my nose so I guess it's the best way for
me<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.030> explain<00:04:46.009> this<00:04:47.009> pattern<00:04:47.460> next<00:04:47.759> is<00:04:48.060> the

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
me to explain this pattern next is the

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.670 
me to explain this pattern next is the
roast<00:04:49.110> cushion<00:04:49.590> blusher<00:04:50.069> and<00:04:51.409> this<00:04:52.409> blush

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
roast cushion blusher and this blush

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.680 
roast cushion blusher and this blush
cost<00:04:53.039> $10<00:04:53.819> and<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.229> color<00:04:59.270> so<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.569> is

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
cost $10 and this is the color so it is

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.300 
cost $10 and this is the color so it is
like<00:05:00.990> I'm<00:05:01.530> not<00:05:01.680> sure<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.009> camera<00:05:02.280> does

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
like I'm not sure that the camera does

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.010 
like I'm not sure that the camera does
any<00:05:02.580> justice<00:05:03.120> but<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.659> is<00:05:04.159> more<00:05:05.159> like<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:06.020> deep

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
any justice but it is more like a deep

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.540 
any justice but it is more like a deep
hot<00:05:08.009> flamingo<00:05:08.819> pink<00:05:09.289> however<00:05:10.289> when<00:05:10.830> I<00:05:11.069> swatch

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.070 
light and powdery I would say the blush

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
useless because the puff itself feels

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.550 
useless because the puff itself feels
