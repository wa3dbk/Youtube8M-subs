pond that they're living in there's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
pond that they're living in there's
nobody<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.710> putting<00:01:14.040> chemicals<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.640> there

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
guys in this video is that you always
use<00:01:29.189> something<00:01:29.579> natural<00:01:29.909> first<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.509> go

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
use something natural first don't go

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.730 
use something natural first don't go
straight<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> chemicals<00:01:31.530> because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
straight for the chemicals because

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
straight for the chemicals because
sometimes<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.850> may<00:01:33.030> work<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> sometimes

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sometimes they may work and sometimes

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.990 
sometimes they may work and sometimes
they<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.470> mostly<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.490> don't<00:01:35.759> work

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
they don't but mostly they don't work

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
they don't but mostly they don't work
like<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.869> example<00:01:36.960> water<00:01:37.409> clarifiers<00:01:38.220> really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
like for example water clarifiers really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
like for example water clarifiers really
don't<00:01:38.820> work<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.420> people<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.310> know

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
don't work all the time people you know

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.950 
don't work all the time people you know
will<00:01:41.610> recommend<00:01:42.090> them<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> store

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
will recommend them to you at the store

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.810 
will recommend them to you at the store
but<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.770> trust<00:01:44.189> me<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.460> used<00:01:44.670> them

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
but they don't trust me I've used them

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.550 
but they don't trust me I've used them
many<00:01:45.090> times<00:01:45.149> before<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> past<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.320> test

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
many times before in the past to test

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.399 
many times before in the past to test
them<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.409> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
them out and they just do not work you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
them out and they just do not work you
should<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:50.070> sure<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.729> everything

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
should really make sure that everything

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
should really make sure that everything
is<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.540> okay<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.049> tank<00:01:52.259> before<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.710> go

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
is going okay in your tank before you go

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
is going okay in your tank before you go
straight<00:01:53.100> work<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> chemicals

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
straight work for you know the chemicals

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
straight work for you know the chemicals
because<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:56.189> water<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> cloudy<00:01:56.850> for

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
because if your water is cloudy for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
because if your water is cloudy for
example<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.930> might<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> try<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> test

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
example you might want to try to test

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.649 
example you might want to try to test
your<00:01:59.430> water<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.030> what's<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.540> in

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
your water and see what's going on in

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
your water and see what's going on in
your<00:02:00.689> water<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.200> nitrates<00:02:01.560> may<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.860> high<00:02:02.100> or

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
your water your nitrates may be high or

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
your water your nitrates may be high or
your<00:02:03.270> aquarium<00:02:03.630> may<00:02:03.899> still<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.409> through

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
your aquarium may still be going through

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.170 
your aquarium may still be going through
the<00:02:04.710> nitrates<00:02:05.100> likely<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.969> set<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the nitrates likely if you just set it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.300 
the nitrates likely if you just set it
up<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.020> there's<00:02:07.350> different<00:02:07.590> things<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
up so there's different things that you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
up so there's different things that you
can<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> test<00:02:09.390> before<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.200> straight

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
can do and test before you go straight

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.370 
can do and test before you go straight
for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
for

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.280 
for
you<00:02:11.470> know<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> chemical<00:02:12.280> product<00:02:12.990> really<00:02:13.990> not

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you know a chemical product really not

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.170 
you know a chemical product really not
for<00:02:14.560> chemicals<00:02:15.010> because<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.910> they're

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
for chemicals because you know they're

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.150 
for chemicals because you know they're
kind<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.450> harsh<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.020> fish<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:17.890> fish

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
kind of harsh on your fish because fish

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
kind of harsh on your fish because fish
in<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> wild<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:18.820> normally<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.390> deal

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
in the wild don't normally have to deal

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.030 
in the wild don't normally have to deal
with<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.840> kind<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.110> stuff<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.830> fish<00:02:21.010> tank

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
with this kind of stuff in a fish tank

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160 
with this kind of stuff in a fish tank
we're<00:02:21.430> trying<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.790> replicate<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.480> natural

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
we're trying to replicate a natural

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.980 
we're trying to replicate a natural
environment<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:25.330> know<00:02:25.450> accomplish

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
environment so to you know accomplish

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.090 
environment so to you know accomplish
that<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.260> really<00:02:26.530> don't<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.950> use

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
that we really don't want to use

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.920 
that we really don't want to use
chemicals<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:27.730> that's<00:02:28.120> not<00:02:28.360> really<00:02:28.750> what

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
chemicals because that's not really what

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.860 
chemicals because that's not really what
fish<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.370> know<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:31.270> around<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
fish have to you know be around in the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.930 
fish have to you know be around in the
wild<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:32.740> are<00:02:32.860> some<00:02:33.070> chemicals<00:02:33.550> like<00:02:33.700> water

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
wild there are some chemicals like water

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.520 
wild there are some chemicals like water
conditioners<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.110> use<00:02:35.260> every

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
conditioners that we have to use every

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.800 
conditioners that we have to use every
time<00:02:35.710> we<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:36.150> water<00:02:37.150> changes<00:02:37.270> there<00:02:37.780> are

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
time we do water changes there are

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.750 
time we do water changes there are
different<00:02:38.680> types<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:39.070> methods<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.550> can<00:02:39.610> use

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
different types of methods you can use

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.390 
different types of methods you can use
to<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.690> without<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.230> water<00:02:41.680> conditioner<00:02:42.160> but

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
to do it without a water conditioner but

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.820 
to do it without a water conditioner but
they<00:02:42.910> usually<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.360> very<00:02:43.600> expensive<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.470> very

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
they usually are very expensive and very

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.640 
they usually are very expensive and very
difficult<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.080> chemicals<00:02:47.080> like<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.470> we

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
difficult so chemicals like that we

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.560 
difficult so chemicals like that we
obviously<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:48.130> no<00:02:48.280> choice<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:48.940> what<00:02:49.480> I'm

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
obviously have no choice but what I'm

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.810 
obviously have no choice but what I'm
really<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.290> focusing<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.280> chemicals

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
really you know focusing on is chemicals

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
really you know focusing on is chemicals
that<00:02:51.970> are<00:02:52.000> extra<00:02:52.510> things<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.950> know

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
that are extra things that you you know

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.440 
that are extra things that you you know
you<00:02:54.100> could<00:02:54.460> buy<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> take<00:02:54.970> care<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.330> problem

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you could buy to take care of a problem

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.730 
you could buy to take care of a problem
when<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.870> could<00:02:56.050> actually<00:02:56.080> do<00:02:56.530> something

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
when you could actually do something

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.280 
when you could actually do something
else<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.760> always<00:02:58.120> try<00:02:58.390> simply<00:02:58.750> natural<00:02:59.080> furs

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
else so always try simply natural furs

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.810 
else so always try simply natural furs
it<00:02:59.500> could<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.770> be<00:02:59.890> beneficial<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> your

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
it could really be beneficial to your
