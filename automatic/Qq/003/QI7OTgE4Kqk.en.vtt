be<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> hot<00:00:49.230> topic<00:00:49.410> exclusive<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.190> had<00:00:50.399> some<00:00:50.700> fear

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
be a hot topic exclusive I had some fear

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
be a hot topic exclusive I had some fear
that<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.600> gonna<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.160> head

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that it was gonna be like the same head

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
that it was gonna be like the same head
as<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.420> sort<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> painted

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
as this one just sort of painted

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
as this one just sort of painted
differently<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.160> completely

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
differently but it is completely

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
differently but it is completely
different<00:00:56.730> sculpt<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.539> far<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.020> where

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
different sculpt as far as like where

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
different sculpt as far as like where
the<00:00:58.260> mouth<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:59.840> also<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> head<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the mouth goes also I think the head is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.889 
the mouth goes also I think the head is
a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:01.980> bigger<00:01:02.480> when<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.629> look<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
a little bit bigger when you look at the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
a little bit bigger when you look at the
two<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.710> definitely<00:01:05.070> looks<00:01:05.309> slightly

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
two of them it definitely looks slightly

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.640 
two of them it definitely looks slightly
larger<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> pop<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> taller<00:01:07.350> but

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
larger I know that the pop is taller but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.080 
larger I know that the pop is taller but
I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> heads<00:01:08.220> slightly<00:01:08.729> bigger<00:01:08.909> as

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I think the heads slightly bigger as

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
I think the heads slightly bigger as
well<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> actual<00:01:10.560> sculpt<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
well now the actual sculpt of like the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.359 
well now the actual sculpt of like the
