00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
engage the design we had a nice little

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.859 
engage the design we had a nice little
see<00:00:52.140> Banksy<00:00:52.710> box<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.549> there<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:54.869

see Banksy box going on there so you
know<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.409> mimics<00:00:55.769> what<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> drew

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
know we're kind of mimics what you drew

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.000 
know we're kind of mimics what you drew
and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.030> fits<00:00:57.329> perfect<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.869> our<00:00:58.019> course<00:00:58.289> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and it fits perfect in our course this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.060 
and it fits perfect in our course this
starts<00:00:59.399> off<00:00:59.549> flat<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> skinny<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:01.649> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
starts off flat and skinny and then it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
starts off flat and skinny and then it
just<00:01:02.100> gradually<00:01:02.549> gets<00:01:03.059> wider<00:01:03.299> and<00:01:03.510> wider

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just gradually gets wider and wider

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
just gradually gets wider and wider
steeper<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.559> steeper<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.759> it's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
steeper and steeper and then it's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.059 
steeper and steeper and then it's
dropping<00:01:06.149> you<00:01:06.360> off<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.860> 45-degree<00:01:07.860> pitch

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
dropping you off at a 45-degree pitch

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.999 
dropping you off at a 45-degree pitch
yeah<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.300> exact<00:01:10.140> yeah<00:01:10.830> the
