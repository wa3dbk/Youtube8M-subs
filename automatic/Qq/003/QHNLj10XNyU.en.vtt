the<00:01:28.710> color<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.810> that's<00:01:30.810> basically<00:01:31.320> what

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the color of that that's basically what

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.640 
the color of that that's basically what
i<00:01:31.590> mean<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:31.950> roll<00:01:32.250> over<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.500> be

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
i mean by roll over that would just be

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.469 
i mean by roll over that would just be
really<00:01:34.979> useful<00:01:35.070> feature<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.270> makes

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
really useful feature it really makes

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
really useful feature it really makes
your<00:01:36.630> website<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.590> lot<00:01:38.159> more

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
your website a lot more

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
your website a lot more
professional-looking<00:01:39.590> they're<00:01:40.590> not

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
professional-looking they're not

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
professional-looking they're not
necessarily<00:01:41.090> professional<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
necessarily professional but it's just a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
necessarily professional but it's just a
nicer<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:44.340> opinion<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> maybe<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.549> could

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
nicer in my opinion so maybe they could

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.859 
nicer in my opinion so maybe they could
have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> whole<00:01:48.649> navigation<00:01:49.649> bar<00:01:50.570> tab<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
have a whole navigation bar tab in the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
have a whole navigation bar tab in the
inspector<00:01:51.899> pain<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
inspector pain but also think the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.539 
inspector pain but also think the
ability<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.659> add<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> vertical<00:01:55.590> navigation<00:01:55.860> bar

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
ability to add a vertical navigation bar

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
ability to add a vertical navigation bar
they<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> text<00:01:57.540> ones<00:01:57.750> at<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> top

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
they have the text ones at the top

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.740 
they have the text ones at the top
horizontally<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.670> i<00:01:59.729> think<00:02:00.030> vertically<00:02:00.600> may

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
horizontally but i think vertically may

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
horizontally but i think vertically may
be<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> side<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:01.979> from<00:02:02.189> some

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
be on this side could be nice from some

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
be on this side could be nice from some
people<00:02:02.820> too<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> drop<00:02:03.750> down<00:02:04.049> menus

people too and drop down menus

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.020 
people too and drop down menus
that<00:02:06.070> would<00:02:06.220> be<00:02:06.340> nice<00:02:06.520> um<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.160> in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.220 

it<00:03:09.770> looks<00:03:10.010> like<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.629> it<00:03:11.629> has<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.989> black

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
it looks like this it has the black

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.210 
it looks like this it has the black
theme<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:14.830> picture<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.129> the

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.470 
navigation bar says my blog has all this
and<00:03:19.069> I<00:03:19.340> think<00:03:19.550> it's<00:03:19.670> really<00:03:19.879> really<00:03:20.300> really

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and I think it's really really really

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.850 
and I think it's really really really
annoying<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.019> have<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.319> every<00:03:21.560> single

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
annoying that I have to every single

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.830 
annoying that I have to every single
time<00:03:22.040> copy<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.790> paste<00:03:22.849> everything<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.690> put

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
time copy and paste everything and put

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.759 
time copy and paste everything and put
it<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.110> here<00:03:26.800> if<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.010> annoying<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:30.590> people

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
it in here if it's annoying for people

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.759 
it in here if it's annoying for people
that<00:03:30.920> make<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.849> have<00:03:32.060> their<00:03:32.780> own<00:03:32.810> customized

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
that make that have their own customized

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.500 
that make that have their own customized
web<00:03:33.980> site<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.310> would<00:03:34.400> be<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.519> lot<00:03:34.670> nicer<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:35.299> just

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
web site it would be a lot nicer to just

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.080 
web site it would be a lot nicer to just
go<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.780> file<00:03:36.170> save<00:03:36.500> as<00:03:37.099> template<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:37.849> in

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
go to file save as template and then in

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960 
go to file save as template and then in
the<00:03:38.209> templates<00:03:38.830> thing<00:03:39.830> when<00:03:40.099> templates

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
the templates thing when templates

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.220 
the templates thing when templates
window<00:03:41.420> when<00:03:41.660> you're<00:03:41.810> choosing<00:03:42.049> your

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
window when you're choosing your

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.170 
window when you're choosing your
templates<00:03:42.769> they'll<00:03:43.610> have<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.510> section<00:03:45.230> of

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
templates they'll have like a section of

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.550 
templates they'll have like a section of
my<00:03:47.180> own<00:03:47.420> templates<00:03:47.959> or<00:03:48.079> something<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.500> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
my own templates or something like that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.039 
my own templates or something like that
and<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.579> can<00:03:49.730> just<00:03:49.819> click<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.239> one<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.870> would

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
and you can just click on one it would

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.699 
and you can just click on one it would
be<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.170> lot<00:03:51.380> easier<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.959> last<00:03:54.170> thing<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
be a lot easier the last thing is the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.490 
be a lot easier the last thing is the
ability<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.519> make<00:03:58.880> gradient<00:03:59.660> with<00:03:59.959> more<00:04:00.349> than

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
ability to make gradient with more than

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.280 
ability to make gradient with more than
two<00:04:00.829> colors<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:01.790> three<00:04:02.239> colors<00:04:03.010> because

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
two colors like three colors because

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.630 
two colors like three colors because
just<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.470> would<00:04:06.620> add<00:04:06.739> Allah<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.280> can<00:04:07.400> see

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
just that would add Allah as you can see

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.800 
just that would add Allah as you can see
in<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.970> graphics<00:04:08.569> tab<00:04:09.380> of<00:04:09.680> inspector<00:04:10.630> well<00:04:11.630> um

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
in the graphics tab of inspector well um

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.050 
in the graphics tab of inspector well um
you<00:04:12.230> have<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.620> option<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.220> use<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.850> gradient

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
you have the option to use the gradient

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.949 
you have the option to use the gradient
tell<00:04:14.500> but<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.950> only<00:04:16.070> choose<00:04:16.519> from<00:04:17.479> two

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
tell but you can only choose from two

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.810 
tell but you can only choose from two
gradients<00:04:20.959> also<00:04:21.739> an<00:04:21.829> eyedropper<00:04:22.039> tool<00:04:22.430> would

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
gradients also an eyedropper tool would

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.409 
gradients also an eyedropper tool would
be<00:04:23.030> useful<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:25.039> I<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.820> does<00:04:26.060> sound<00:04:26.240> a

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
be useful and I know this does sound a

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.120 
be useful and I know this does sound a
bit<00:04:26.450> complicated<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.440> mean<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:27.950> need

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
bit complicated I mean you don't need

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.600 
bit complicated I mean you don't need
all<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.550> these<00:04:29.240> things<00:04:29.600> but<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.740> think

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
all of these things but I think

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.940 
all of these things but I think
especially<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.780> template<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
especially the template and the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.740 
especially the template and the
navigation<00:04:34.580> bar<00:04:34.700> options<00:04:35.180> would<00:04:35.360> be<00:04:35.419> really

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
navigation bar options would be really

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.290 
navigation bar options would be really
really<00:04:36.169> really<00:04:36.680> useful<00:04:36.979> so<00:04:37.639> those<00:04:37.880> are<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.150> a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
really really useful so those are just a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.920 
really really useful so those are just a
few<00:04:38.330> things<00:04:38.840> that<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.919> wish<00:04:40.250> were<00:04:41.150> incorporated

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
few things that I wish were incorporated

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.080 
few things that I wish were incorporated
into<00:04:42.080> iWeb<00:04:42.940> maybe<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.450> web<00:04:45.020> 09<00:04:45.380> or<00:04:45.710> iWeb<00:04:46.130> 10

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
into iWeb maybe I web 09 or iWeb 10
