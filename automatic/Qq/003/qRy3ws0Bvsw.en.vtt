below that you can jailbreak you just do
not<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> update<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.080> 61.3<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.700> that

not want to update it 61.3 I know that
jailbreak<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.420> talked<00:01:30.630> about<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
jailbreak I just talked about the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
jailbreak I just talked about the
evasion<00:01:31.439> jailbreak<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.610> untethered<00:01:33.150> as

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
evasion jailbreak it is untethered as

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
evasion jailbreak it is untethered as
Melissa<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
Melissa you do know that as well but if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
Melissa you do know that as well but if
you<00:01:35.189> did<00:01:35.340> update<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.930> 6.3<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.130> your

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you did update the 6.3 as long as your

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
you did update the 6.3 as long as your
device<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> pre<00:01:38.970> a5<00:01:39.360> device<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.560> can

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
actually jailbreak that tethered using

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
actually jailbreak that tethered using
redsnow<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.460> tethered

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
redsnow so it's not on tethered

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.910 
redsnow so it's not on tethered
jailbreak<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.290> least<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.829> at

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
jailbreak but you're at least you can at

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
jailbreak but you're at least you can at
least<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.220> jailbreak<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
least have a jailbreak this way and that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
least have a jailbreak this way and that
is<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.070> previously<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.299> limelight

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
is because previously the limelight

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
is because previously the limelight
exploit<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> hardware<00:01:52.860> exploit<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
exploit was a hardware exploit and that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
exploit was a hardware exploit and that
was<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> a4<00:01:54.659> devices<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> prea

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
was for all the a4 devices and the prea

was for all the a4 devices and the prea
for<00:01:55.860> devices<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.090> basically<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.689> always

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
for devices so basically you can always

do break those devices no matter what

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.730 
do break those devices no matter what
tethered<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.590> going

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
tethered you can it's not always going

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340 
tethered you can it's not always going
to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.890> untethered<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.630> will<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:03.930> tethered

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
to be untethered but it will be tethered

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
to be untethered but it will be tethered
you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.920> least<00:02:04.950> always<00:02:05.250> jailbreak<00:02:05.700> those

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you can at least always jailbreak those

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
you can at least always jailbreak those

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
out so now if you are in 6.3 like i said

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.150 
out so now if you are in 6.3 like i said
there<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.960> no<00:02:25.140> untether<00:02:25.590> jailbreak<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:26.040> that

there is no untether jailbreak for that

but if your device is a pre if I'm
device<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.290> jailbreak<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.800> tethered<00:02:29.360> but

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
device you can jailbreak it tethered but

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.420

we're<00:02:30.540> most<00:02:30.780> likely<00:02:30.990> not<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.710> see<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.100> six

all right here and that's because the

exploits they have for a major release

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
exploits they have for a major release
of<00:02:46.080> iOS<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> most<00:02:47.010> likely<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.610> iOS<00:02:48.030> 7

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
of iOS which it most likely be iOS 7

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.720 
of iOS which it most likely be iOS 7
we're<00:02:49.140> not<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.650> any<00:02:49.830> major<00:02:50.280> updates

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
we're not going to see any major updates

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060 
we're not going to see any major updates
to<00:02:50.880> iOS<00:02:51.150> 6<00:02:51.360> really<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.020> most<00:02:52.530> likely<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
to iOS 6 really so most likely all the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.590 
to iOS 6 really so most likely all the
exploits<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.580> have<00:02:53.700> no<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:54.150> they<00:02:54.450> have

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
exploits they have no I think they have

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.090 
exploits they have no I think they have
looks<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.200> they<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.350> three<00:02:55.650> exploits

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
looks like they have three exploits

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
looks like they have three exploits
right<00:02:56.280> now<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.640> thought<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.240> said<00:02:57.420> something

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
right now I thought they said something

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
right now I thought they said something
like<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:57.990> had<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> five<00:02:58.890> room<00:02:59.160> or

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
like they had a like a five room or

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.320 
like they had a like a five room or
something<00:02:59.490> like<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> think<00:03:00.090> they

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
something like that but I think they

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.210 
something like that but I think they
might<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.480> used<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:00.870> those<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.770> evasion

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
might be used all those on the evasion

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
might be used all those on the evasion
jailbreak<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.660> looks<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.960> only<00:03:03.990> have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
jailbreak so it looks like the only have

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.020 
jailbreak so it looks like the only have
three<00:03:04.470> right<00:03:04.620> now<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.160> any<00:03:05.460> exploit

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
three right now but they any exploit

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.640 
three right now but they any exploit
they<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.330> right<00:03:06.510> now<00:03:06.660> that's<00:03:07.200> unused

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
they have right now that's unused

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.010 
they have right now that's unused
they're<00:03:07.950> not<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> use<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:08.760> iOS<00:03:09.750> 6

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
they're not going to use it for iOS 6

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.120 
they're not going to use it for iOS 6
they're<00:03:10.260> most<00:03:10.380> likely<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.830> hold<00:03:11.010> off

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
they're most likely going to hold off

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.130 
they're most likely going to hold off
and<00:03:11.400> wait<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.670> iOS<00:03:11.910> 7<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.390> they're<00:03:12.990> going<00:03:13.080> to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and wait for iOS 7 and they're going to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.230 
and wait for iOS 7 and they're going to
use<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.520> if<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.670> guys<00:03:14.790> are<00:03:15.000> stuck

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
use it for that so if you guys are stuck

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.610 
use it for that so if you guys are stuck
in<00:03:15.300> six<00:03:15.630> point<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:15.930> point<00:03:15.990> three<00:03:16.230> don't

expect the jailbreak for it it's very
very<00:03:18.900> unlikely<00:03:19.200> fret<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:19.739> happen<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.489> are

these<00:05:08.950> exploits<00:05:09.370> they're<00:05:09.640> saving<00:05:09.910> right<00:05:10.030> now

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
these exploits they're saving right now

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.810 
these exploits they're saving right now
for<00:05:10.900> iOS<00:05:10.960> 7<00:05:11.410> Apple<00:05:11.830> might<00:05:11.950> patch<00:05:12.190> season<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.670> was

for iOS 7 Apple might patch season I was

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.580 
for iOS 7 Apple might patch season I was
seven<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.480> all<00:05:13.600> these<00:05:13.690> exploits<00:05:14.110> for<00:05:14.260> saving

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
seven so all these exploits for saving

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.160 
seven so all these exploits for saving
right<00:05:14.680> now<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:14.980> they<00:05:15.070> can<00:05:15.190> use<00:05:15.310> an<00:05:15.430> iOS<00:05:15.700> 6<00:05:16.170> once

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
right now and they can use an iOS 6 once

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.510 
right now and they can use an iOS 6 once
I<00:05:17.320> was<00:05:17.470> seven<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.800> released<00:05:18.070> all<00:05:18.340> those

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
I was seven is released all those

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.640 
I was seven is released all those
exploits<00:05:18.850> could<00:05:19.210> just<00:05:19.390> pretty<00:05:20.200> much<00:05:20.320> have<00:05:20.470> no

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
exploits could just pretty much have no

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.770 
exploits could just pretty much have no
use<00:05:20.890> at<00:05:21.070> all<00:05:21.160> if<00:05:21.970> Apple<00:05:22.240> patches<00:05:22.630> those

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
use at all if Apple patches those

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.050 
use at all if Apple patches those
exploits<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.380> they<00:05:23.530> have<00:05:23.650> right<00:05:23.830> now<00:05:24.060> so

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
exploits that they have right now so

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.430 
exploits that they have right now so
then<00:05:25.240> kind<00:05:25.480> of<00:05:25.540> saving<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.140> kind<00:05:26.350> of<00:05:26.380> a

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
then kind of saving it it's kind of a

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.990 
then kind of saving it it's kind of a
risk<00:05:26.710> we<00:05:26.890> could<00:05:27.040> also<00:05:27.160> end<00:05:27.250> up<00:05:27.370> paint<00:05:27.610> off<00:05:27.790> if

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
risk we could also end up paint off if

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.610 
risk we could also end up paint off if
they<00:05:28.090> don't<00:05:28.300> patch<00:05:28.510> them<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.350> if<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.470> guys

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
they don't patch them so if you guys

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.470 
they don't patch them so if you guys
