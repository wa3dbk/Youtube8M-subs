like to go a couple more rounds in one
of<00:04:01.269> these<00:04:01.329> fights<00:04:01.599> just<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.200> feel<00:04:02.440> for

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
things and maybe get into going a little

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:05.490 
things and maybe get into going a little
bit<00:04:04.420> longer<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.840> think<00:04:05.049> as<00:04:05.139> we<00:04:05.230> stepped<00:04:05.440> over

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.690 
bit longer I think as we stepped over
the<00:04:05.620> rounds<00:04:05.889> you<00:04:05.950> definitely<00:04:06.280> step<00:04:06.430> up<00:04:06.549> in

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
the rounds you definitely step up in

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.979 
the rounds you definitely step up in
competition<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.510> will<00:04:07.660> come<00:04:07.780> soon

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
competition and that will come soon

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.120 
competition and that will come soon
enough<00:04:08.049> at<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.500> point<00:04:08.590> we're<00:04:08.829> just<00:04:08.859> trying

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
enough at this point we're just trying

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.650 
enough at this point we're just trying
to<00:04:09.190> learn<00:04:09.310> with<00:04:09.489> every<00:04:09.700> outing<00:04:09.880> being<00:04:10.480> able<00:04:10.540> to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
learned something at the night I think I

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.589 
learned something at the night I think I
learned<00:04:14.139> how<00:04:14.290> pulling<00:04:14.530> over<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.769> right<00:04:15.599> we're

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
learned how pulling over and right we're

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:17.610 
learned how pulling over and right we're
looking<00:04:16.690> forward<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.349> you<00:04:17.440> know<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
looking forward to that you know the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.319 
looking forward to that you know the
tougher<00:04:17.799> opponents<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.400> I'll<00:04:18.880> keep<00:04:19.030> training

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
tougher opponents and I'll keep training

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.670 
tougher opponents and I'll keep training
and<00:04:19.479> could<00:04:19.930> concentrate<00:04:20.200> on<00:04:20.349> doing<00:04:20.590> things

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.140 
and could concentrate on doing things
right<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.979> think<00:04:21.250> we'll<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.459> successful<00:04:21.609> I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150
