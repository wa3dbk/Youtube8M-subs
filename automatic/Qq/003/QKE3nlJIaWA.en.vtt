 so is 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.439

 the critics see all the technical data what we have here they are in 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.650
 our special

 on the big hook 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.950
 all now do not even re-selected the battery life is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.940
 below dimensions and of course a low weight 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 these tests should 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.780
 in fact the kids had to look at her can be absolutely smooth our good 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.820

 The one on the side of the known Android 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
 Ask Carsten Rump

 and if we look at the connections on the page 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 so is provided with Velcro 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.450
 vice versa so we have on the side once a USB HDMI port 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.630
 for your headphones a micro sd-card slot the connection he says himself 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.940
 Oberliga

 the built-in microphone 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.760
 and a device. "Yes, that looks a bit like one 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.530
 sim-card-slot now unfortunately is not explain 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.560
 the performance of the preparation has been seen 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 So you can see more forest director Werner on it 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.010
 also very fast 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 finally a victory ago two devices that can hold in your hands 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 set the countries 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.970
 unfortunately we never do not 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.340
 Compounds that is a pity
