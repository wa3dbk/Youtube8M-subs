00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.029

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.480
 with cream prune sauce to us 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.500
 I need stuffing here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 cumin from spices 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 I won't add anything else for 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 sauce I'll take sour cream ketchup sliced 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.739
 prune steamed it I already 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 very soft sliced â€‹â€‹so large 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.379
 pieces of garlic combine minced boiled 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.899

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.229
 our stuffing and mix everything stuffing ready and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.619
 next we need to roll the balls a little 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 more than a walnut in diameter 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.049
 such start cooking sauce to me 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.830
 will need 2 tablespoons of tomato 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.299
 pasta or ketchup 3 4 tablespoons 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.710

 steamed finely chopped prunes 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.550
 By the way, you can use a jar 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.550
 baby prunes puree 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.870
 I do not chop pieces of prunes yet 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.070
 better because when the sauce will 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.550
 languish in a slow cooker 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:12.620
 prunes turn into mashed potatoes and then I 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:14.770
 I will add about three fourth water 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:23.440
 glasses 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:25.820
 here I reduce the sauce for the meatballs ready 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.240
 prepared meatballs laid on the bottom 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.590
 saucepans for multicooker 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.680
 pour our meatballs prepared 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.680
 the sauce 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.780
 we distribute prunes over the surface and 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.930
 in no particular order 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.930
 lay out the garlic pieces 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.290
 I will use the slow cooker I choose 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:02.140
 quenching mode and cooking time 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.730
 default 1 hour start meatballs ready 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.079
