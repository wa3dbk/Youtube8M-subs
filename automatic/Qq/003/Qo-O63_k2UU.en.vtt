00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
immune chin 14 16 and it seems like it's

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.440 
immune chin 14 16 and it seems like it's
like<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.320> hybrid<00:03:26.950> car<00:03:26.980> lately<00:03:27.550> you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
like it's like a hybrid car lately you

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.360 
like it's like a hybrid car lately you
know<00:03:28.530> fs2<00:03:30.750> 1942<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.780> third<00:03:32.080> power<00:03:32.380> so

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
know fs2 1942 the third power so

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.350 
know fs2 1942 the third power so
basically<00:03:34.210> a<00:03:35.160> lusty<00:03:36.160> seven<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.880> another

basically a lusty seven is another

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
basically a lusty seven is another
principle<00:03:37.990> probably<00:03:38.830> on<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.010> lower<00:03:39.040> step<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
principle probably on the lower step the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.750 
principle probably on the lower step the
lower<00:03:39.970> step<00:03:40.510> then<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.440> actually<00:03:41.980> hybrid<00:03:42.490> so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
lower step then this actually hybrid so

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.540 
lower step then this actually hybrid so
