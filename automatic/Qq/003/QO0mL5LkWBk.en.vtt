00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.199
 episode we nearly so

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.400
 I appreciate so much we're going to pass that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.869
 let's move on to see what happened in this 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.399
 first match of the series eighths of 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.660
 final but first I want to teach the 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.670
 team in which we are going to play that is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.340
 this a team of all players of the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.649
 Korean League and Koreans also that is 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.469
 the easiest way to fit to cannes or 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.090
 in a team with rapport and good 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.440
 Well, as I said, we started with a team 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.200
 of bronze that we will improve little 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.510
 little and let's see how he started how 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.920
 we started the series because it's going to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.350
 surprise the truth is a team that I 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.879
 I did not expect at all I could think or 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.100
 think better that the team was going to 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.250
 be gold but I did not expect this 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.039
 team an incredible team with suárez 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.550
 agüero messi neymar and robben up and 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.620
 then 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 low one time also goes amazing and 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.870
 no doorman yesterday or what we are 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.830
 I could touch, I think the worst 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.210
 we started the series we started with this 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.920
 play that I put it in fast camera 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 because I combo and take out the center 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.940
 we retrieve the ball and it does not smell 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.220
 he smells it and here he starts playing very 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.590
 pretty tired and heeled we return it 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.120
 and we miss first shot on goal in the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.760
 3 minute good first shot in the minute 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.950
 3 that we did not get to mark because good 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.480
 logically he is a bronze player and the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.200
 shot that he has then he is not very very 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.850
 good 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.830
 minute 15 we return to recover the ball 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.300
 we give it again to cannes oil and 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.010
 look at speed speed logía 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 we try to cut for the first time not 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.940
 we can to the second we can cut 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
 but finally by the middle jordi alba 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.320
 I think it was and if there is jordi alba and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 bonus referee gives PENALTY others 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.040
 repetition for you to judge 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.210
 same if you think it is a penalty or not already 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.800
 you know this year because there's no 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.540
 very clear penalties that do not whistle 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.650
 others that are less clear as by 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.600
 example this one yes the hospital 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.400
 Well that depends a little on the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.620
 lucky so we have nothing the first 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.140
 occasion of goal of Nestor eighths of 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.880
 final in the 17th minute and logically the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.130
 penalty is going to throw him can soil a 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 penalty that I suffered a bit is worth and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.350
 now you will see 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.320
 as you can see the bar to see where we have 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 that fit the ones a little small and 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.770
 we mark with the goal scoring but with a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.200
 little tension because yesterday did not 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.580
 he finished pulling to the side until the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 last moment practically me of 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.820
 I really thought I was stopping him because 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.190
 is that it took a long time now to see about the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.810
 repetition as I shot and almost almost 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.360
 when he is going to give him the ball in the face 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.340
 is when you pull in this repetition be 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.660
 a little better you see how it looks 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 that is going to stay still that is going to 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.800
 stop and just at the last moment it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.050
 throw to the side good I think that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.520
 it was also a bit of error I do not know I do not know 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.420
 what happened but the fact is that we mark the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.950
 goal that is the important thing 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.690
 we scored the first goal of the series 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.670
 first goal of the round of 16 and what 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 mark tired there as honor and so we go 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.630
 the rest will come from the first part 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.550
 to the break of the game as you see three 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.460
 I shot a door that has been the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.230
 penalty a goal and he was not even 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.240
 pulling on the door had been a couple of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 times but he manages to remove the ball 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.710
 and he can not shoot a shot to the door 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.880
 been the coso put at the beginning another no 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.920
 it's the opposite because it was nothing 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.300
 clear and the other shot is the one of the goal thus 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 that we're going to pass the second part in 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.510
 where the first danger play by 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 our part and the general party does not 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.170
 arrives until minute 72 in this game 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 that we went out against 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.660
 and we give a pass here and we 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.640
 pitan lack us pitan penalti I hesitated 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.319
 very much but finally we are whistled 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.239
 missing you will now see where he places the 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.760
 ball the case the one that sticks to throw 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.319
 but it's a few centimeters more than 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.819
 forward and you see it and it would have been 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.890
 penalty but well we have another foul 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.390
 a logically dangerous failure 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.950
 with more quality players would be more 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.989
 easy then what I decide to do is 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.209
 accept a little touch he threw it at me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.920
 ahead and shot with tired the second goal 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.140
 it was the only thing he could do since he 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.330
 I was missing if you go outside yes or yes 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.680
 because there I am not even that they are 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.480
 the faults are a little easier to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.800
 mark that last year but I the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.540
 I'm not good at all either and I think 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.040
 that this is the best option besides 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.989
 it's quite close and it was 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.160
 pretty easy to mark if the ball was going 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.620
 between the three suits the I had the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.790
 repeat we scored the second goal but 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.230
 we were going to last little joy because 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.549
 in a few minutes then take the ball 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.040
 messi starts to get inside 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.019
 plays typical of the kick shoots between 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.389
 between the three suits but goes directly to 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.729
 Goalkeeper but good just entering goal 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.310
 the goalkeeper is a goalkeeper of 62 on average 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.080
 bronze not shiny web at the end what 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.030
 get we did not manage to stop it and in the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.210
 minute 85 comes back to us with a lot 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.949
 danger 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.590
 where are you but luckily the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.850
 goalkeeper puts his hand and ends up stopping me 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.889
 I did not know at the time he had stopped 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.410
 with the head with the hand but the case 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.060
 is that the bed of andaz cortez to corner and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.860
 in the corner for a good header 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.509
 but it goes outside and here we have the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.430
 last play on our part in 190 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.729
 will run in favor but just when there was 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.889
 center on this the connection goes we win 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.080
 the match 2 to 1 round of 16 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.880
 we go to the quarterfinals with cançó 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.310
 and as a clear enough protagonist with 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.900
 two goals one penalty that good as 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.849
 I am going to judge and you judge 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.130
 you consider that the criminal I do not and a 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.419
 It's a good thing that it's pretty good and 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
 yes it is true that with this team of 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.199
 I'm not going to do much more 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.910
 be what to do so much or could not 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.370
 do anything more let's say think that is 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.380
 a team that had Suarez had an omen 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.910
 had messi had robben had neymar 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.949
 He was a real great team 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.900
 I believe that winning is already a merit 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.520
 very big with this equipment so nothing 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.500
 we have four points because as you know 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.509
 two council goals are four points 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.889
 less a point than loans because we 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.870
 they have scored a goal we have three points 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.480
 with what we 're going to improve the team 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.790
 passing three players from bronze to silver 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.980
 from bronze to gold directly and another to 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.630
 silver we'll see what we do 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.950
 we'll see in the next episode so 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.060
 nothing as I always tell you I hope that you 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.320
 I liked the video I hope it has 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.760
 liked this first episode of the series 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.050
 I hope to improve the topic of 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.060
 comment because it's not something that usually 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.200
 do this kind of videos so nothing 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.120
 as always if we use all the villain 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.230
 well is to give like subscribes to the channel 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.850
 greeting you and see you in the 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.850
 next video see you soon
