overall<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:46.020> yeah<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.530> guess<00:00:46.830> is<00:00:47.040> is<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.910> do

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
overall but yeah my guess is is don't do

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.870 
overall but yeah my guess is is don't do
any<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.630> sets<00:00:48.900> yet<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.880> because

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
any of the sets yet why because

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.820 
any of the sets yet why because
supposedly<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.810> gonna<00:00:51.990> be<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.260> ultimate

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
supposedly there's gonna be an ultimate

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.920 
supposedly there's gonna be an ultimate
combine<00:00:53.340> warrior<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.300> might<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.540> using

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
combine warrior and it might be using

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.550 
combine warrior and it might be using
this<00:00:55.080> same<00:00:55.350> set<00:00:55.830> as<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.310> guys<00:00:56.550> um<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.560> you

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
this same set as these guys um so you

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.050 
this same set as these guys um so you
really<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.340> ultimate<00:00:59.580> combine

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
really want to get the ultimate combine

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.640 
really want to get the ultimate combine
work<00:01:00.240> because<00:01:00.450> that<00:01:00.570> could<00:01:00.720> be<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> bo<00:01:01.110> Jackson

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
work because that could be a bo Jackson

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.620 
work because that could be a bo Jackson
or<00:01:01.770> Deion<00:01:02.340> Sanders<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.240> just<00:01:03.360> my

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
or Deion Sanders but that's just my

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.299 
or Deion Sanders but that's just my
guess<00:01:03.690> don't<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.589> marbles<00:01:04.949> into

guess don't put all your marbles into

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
guess don't put all your marbles into
one<00:01:05.489> basket<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> guess

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
one basket because that's just a guess

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
one basket because that's just a guess
guys<00:01:07.259> another<00:01:08.250> reason<00:01:08.520> why<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> shouldn't

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
