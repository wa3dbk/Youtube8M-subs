00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
anyway since I won't I may not be a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.870 
anyway since I won't I may not be a
Disney<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.900> much<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.650> normal<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.220> decided<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
Disney as much as normal I decided to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
Disney as much as normal I decided to
get<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.060> things<00:01:21.299> together<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.049> can

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
get some things together so that I can

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
get some things together so that I can
practice<00:01:22.560> coloring<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.340> color

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
practice coloring because I don't color

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
practice coloring because I don't color
too<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:27.350> time<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
too much I just don't have time to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.210 
too much I just don't have time to
really<00:01:28.890> focus<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.119> i<00:01:30.329> figured<00:01:31.170> i<00:01:31.680> would

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
really focus on it so i figured i would

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
really focus on it so i figured i would
get<00:01:32.340> some<00:01:32.520> things<00:01:32.700> together<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.509> me

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
get some things together to take with me

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.980 
get some things together to take with me

i'll try and find a name of this for you
I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.280> nimi<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.970> something<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I think it's nimi or something like that

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.830 
I think it's nimi or something like that
I<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> starts<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.649> an<00:01:49.770> end<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.659> they're

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I know it starts with an end but they're

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
I know it starts with an end but they're
very<00:01:51.869> inexpensive<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> find<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very inexpensive I think you can find a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.300 
very inexpensive I think you can find a
bit<00:01:53.729> Michaels<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.920> they're<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.070> great

bit Michaels and they're really great
paints<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.070> i<00:01:59.070> figure<00:01:59.340> i<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.579> take<00:01:59.759> my

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430
