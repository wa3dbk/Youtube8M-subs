00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.860
 and good friends as they are because I'm 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.920
 very good here, commenting because 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.400
 the one from mexico and we are once again in 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.150
 minecraft but this time it's not going to be a 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.630
 of my series or anything but how to install 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.630
 a mod let's see what mod is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.640
 of the most needed modes in minecraft 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.690
 for me I do not know 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 this map that you see here 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:39.059
 on the right side up on the corner 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.650
 this map has many but many 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.489
 utilities which for example this 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.489
 we approach here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.640
 we enter is our house as in this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.870
 very ugly 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.219
 but to see 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 we press m we get this less 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.930
 We waypoints this is another already 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.930
 had we are going to eliminate 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.710
 then to this we give 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.220
 and here we select a name I'm not going 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.960
 to put 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.460
 kasabian and here in color we put the one 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.460
 I want to put it 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.460
 ok and we move a bit and as we see already 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.980
 here we have our point and it appears in 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.330
 the map a bit clear but good 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.720
 appears 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.540
 we left shit 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.030
 we went out 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.520
 and we move away and as we see there we 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.580
 indicates where is our house which 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.900
 It is very useful to go out and explore and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.380
 Other things 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.159
 has an infinity of 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.710
 that of utilities for example we 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.630
 can give a death point 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.390
 for example 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:16.300
 Here we put it, let's kill us 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.300
 see let's get creative 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.290
 a little fly flies 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.219
 let's see a little 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.390
 survival and today we're still alive I do not have 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.390
 I have to die 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.020
 for here 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.860
 God 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.860
 again 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.090
 ready wow 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.049
 real look like we're here in the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.329
 house so we had slept 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.329
 we open we leave here 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.440
 and as we see here we get the death point 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.440
 where we died this shit 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.040
 damn I want good and we go back to 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.420
 die and there has the other death 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.760
 account 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.880
 where once again are all of our 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.120
 courses all our experience and everything 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.040
 It is very useful because if not to lose everything 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.819
 what we had 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.519
 and this after having died many 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.720
 Sometimes we will achieve to have that 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.310
 there 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.220
 the mobs of the map are on waypoints 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.590
 and here in the dead points we give them 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.140
 or if we want we can eliminate them 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.600
 directly to a cell x remove and already 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.790
 it does not appear good to us now let's how 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.790
 install this good amount 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.610
 sorry my desk is disgusting 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.840
 but well here I am going to leave you this 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.870
 page 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.530
 in the video link and go to camps 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.650
 we go down here where it says download 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.389
 here we are going to select our version 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.410
 from minecraft as you can see from the 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.810
 very first 1.0 so far 1.1 points 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.550
 4.5 that the most current I do not know if they go to 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.009
 get more out most likely yes 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.259
 well we give it to 1.4 point 5 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.680
 We hope that we will send a 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.000
 atf link page 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.610
 we hope here we give 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.320
 when you remove this let's jump 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.150
 advertising and we will start to 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.790
 downloading a file will weigh a lot 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.040
 so they see that I do not obviously 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.400
 because I already have it, we are going to give the equipment 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.850
 where have things saved and here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.850
 minimum rate appears 1 point 4.5 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.030
 but now these are only three files 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.310
 good and a folder 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.430
 now let's start and here in this bar 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.770
 we give you percent app data percent 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.410
 but users of windows xp in the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.449
 right part of his bar I asked for a letter 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.910
 a button that appears to run 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.169
 and we are going to put good percent app 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.400
 percent data 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:30.750
 we give you enter roaming here we look for the 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.750
 folder called minecraft point 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.710
 once inside the bin folder and this 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.350
 it says minecraft right click to open 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.190
 with windows archive 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:49.210
 and we are looking for the folder that is called 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.070
 goal and capitalized if you're not going to 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.750
 skip this step but if it were you 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.540
 we would click and we would take out the 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.980
 top button that says delete 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.500
 eliminated because it could make 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.990
 our minecraft frisking everything 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.180
 then we do not want that here 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.950
 we drag the files possibly 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.290
 Abajito where I did not have any folders 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.139
 so that our files do not get 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.040
 where they do not see very well then we give 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.590
 we hope and here this will appear 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.720
 we have to see very well here where it says 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.580
 update mode we have to 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.860
 leave it where it says add and replace 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.990
 files very well once done that you 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.210
 we accept and it will begin to happen 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.400
 all of our things this now already 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.660
 we can close and we will enter 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.380
 minecraft to see if our mode 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.380
 it works perfectly 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.879
 mmm 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.970
 and as you see our minecraft is very 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.760
 well not creation 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:49.430
 then now we will wait very well 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:53.920
 and here we are at 34.5 we enter 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:58.610
 cutting the world and here we are ready 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.560
 With our map and it is good that was it 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.900
 friends and I hope you liked the 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.910
 light favorites your beliefs and they are not 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.210
 and see you in the next video 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.210
 bye Bye
