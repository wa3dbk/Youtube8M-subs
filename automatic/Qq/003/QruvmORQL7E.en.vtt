sections<00:01:22.710> may<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:22.979> damaged<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
sections may be damaged but this is the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
sections may be damaged but this is the
most<00:01:25.590> common<00:01:26.040> area<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> gets<00:01:26.759> damaged<00:01:28.100> we

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
most common area that gets damaged we

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.179 
most common area that gets damaged we
have<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> filter<00:01:33.979> whenever<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
have also the filter whenever this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.300 
have also the filter whenever this
transmission<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.329> rebuilt<00:01:37.100> it's<00:01:38.100> very

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
transmission is rebuilt it's very

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
transmission is rebuilt it's very
necessary<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.409> replace<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.060> filter<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:44.070> in

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
necessary to replace the filter but in

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.999 
necessary to replace the filter but in
our<00:01:44.340> case<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.570> rebel<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.829> don't

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
our case when we do a rebel we don't

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
our case when we do a rebel we don't
just<00:01:47.250> replace<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:49.409> clutches<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.450> filter

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
just replace the clutches and the filter

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.709 
just replace the clutches and the filter
only<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:54.270> try<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> extra<00:01:55.439> mile<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
only we try to go the extra mile to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.319 
only we try to go the extra mile to
replace<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> required<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.250> get<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
replace all that is required to get the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.649 
replace all that is required to get the
transmission<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> operate<00:02:01.469> properly<00:02:02.540> when<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
transmission to operate properly when it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.880

the second clutch piston it is useful to

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.490 
the second clutch piston it is useful to
understand<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.370> whenever<00:03:25.790> they<00:03:26.180> clutch<00:03:26.500> or

understand that whenever they clutch or

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
understand that whenever they clutch or
the<00:03:27.800> friction<00:03:28.040> place<00:03:28.460> to<00:03:28.640> get<00:03:28.760> back<00:03:30.520> the

the friction place to get back the
pistons<00:03:31.970> also<00:03:32.330> get<00:03:32.510> affected<00:03:32.990> because<00:03:33.770> of<00:03:33.980> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
pistons also get affected because of the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.590 
pistons also get affected because of the
amount<00:03:34.490> of<00:03:34.670> heat<00:03:34.730> generated<00:03:40.330> these<00:03:41.330> are<00:03:41.510> the

amount of heat generated these are the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.130 
amount of heat generated these are the

but<00:04:05.370> above<00:04:05.580> all<00:04:05.960> you<00:04:06.960> make<00:04:07.170> sure<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.910> we<00:04:08.910> also

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
but above all you make sure that we also

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.000 
but above all you make sure that we also
do<00:04:10.080> something<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.800> valve<00:04:11.010> body<00:04:13.010> because

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
do something to the valve body because

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.080 
do something to the valve body because
the<00:04:14.670> operation<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.420> gearbox<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:16.650> mainly

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
the operation of the gearbox is mainly

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.350 
the operation of the gearbox is mainly
based<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.600> balcony<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> valve

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
based on the balcony this is a valve

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.880 
based on the balcony this is a valve

through with it

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.150 
through with it
we'll<00:04:30.750> make<00:04:30.900> sure<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.140> we<00:04:31.470> put<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:32.660> rebuilt

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
we'll make sure that we put in a rebuilt

valve body the rebuild valve body is as
good<00:04:43.080> as<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.320> new<00:04:43.560> valve<00:04:43.800> body<00:04:45.740> but<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:46.890> better

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
good as a new valve body but it's better

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.910 
good as a new valve body but it's better
in<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.430> sense<00:04:47.640> that<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.360> cheaper

replace the speed sensors but when we do
the<00:06:42.990> overhaul<00:06:45.000> we<00:06:46.000> clean<00:06:46.360> them<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:47.010> test<00:06:48.010> them
