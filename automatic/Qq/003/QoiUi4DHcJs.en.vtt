 to make cupcakes now take into account 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.660
 the following if you can not find the 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.309
 mixture of royal there's zinc I'm going to 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.130
 make sure to include 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.770
 the royal recipe there is zinc that is made 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.450
 using in egg white and sugar 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:19.700
 in powder you are nozzles in particular 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 are to tecos are 104 102 and 101 but 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.049
 any nozzle you have to make 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.549
 flowers should work perfect 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.009
 just remember that the nozzles 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.159
 being key are narrow in the part of 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.079
 above and before at the bottom and 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.899
 when you use them remember that 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.899
 the wide part always goes down 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 here we already have the royal there is zinc in the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.979
 cover with our small nozzle 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.979

 chopsticks and paper chips 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.980
 let's start 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 you take the stick this way 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.330

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.340
 remembering to ensure that the part 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.200
 wide of the mouthpiece on the part of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.930
 down 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.930
 and the pressure comes from here 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.410
 you took the toothpick like this 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.430
 about is the mouthpiece the toothpick and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.740
 you start to spin 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.980

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.840
 our flower if you notice here 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.410
 you can see here 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.019
 that does not look so pretty then what 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.569
 Let's do is take our brush 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:47.180
 we have here we put it in a 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.650
 little cornstarch or cornstarch 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.310

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.430
 down 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.230
 to make sure it sticks well to 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.230
 stick and everything looks 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.720
 perfect we take the brand again 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.290
 you wind pressure good to have you 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.560
 You guarantee that the wide part is 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.560
 down 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.670
 and then we started this time we're going to
