Massa<00:00:02.600> king<00:00:03.600> fish<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:04.710> know<00:00:04.830> Marseille<00:00:05.160> is

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
Massa king fish you know Marseille is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.760 
Massa king fish you know Marseille is
just<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.609> Japanese<00:00:05.970> word<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
just the Japanese word for it this is a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.490 
just the Japanese word for it this is a
thermal<00:00:08.639> circulator<00:00:09.269> okay<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.200> immersion

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
thermal circulator okay or immersion

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.789 
thermal circulator okay or immersion
circulator<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.730> put<00:00:11.969> sous<00:00:12.300> vide<00:00:12.480> cooking<00:00:13.019> sous

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
circulator is put sous vide cooking sous

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
circulator is put sous vide cooking sous
vide<00:00:14.009> means<00:00:14.460> under<00:00:14.910> pressure<00:00:15.179> okay<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
vide means under pressure okay so the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040 
vide means under pressure okay so the
product<00:00:17.310> itself<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.850> been<00:00:18.000> applied<00:00:18.359> with

product itself has been applied with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.310 
product itself has been applied with
pressure<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.830> vacuum<00:00:20.779> all<00:00:21.779> we've<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:22.080> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
pressure in a vacuum all we've done is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200

they make an ingredient called Activa TI

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.940 
they make an ingredient called Activa TI
this<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.840> essentially<00:02:16.610> meat<00:02:17.610> glue<00:02:18.200> okay<00:02:19.200> goes

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
this is essentially meat glue okay goes

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.190 
this is essentially meat glue okay goes
in<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.970> basically<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:21.390> blend<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.870> bad<00:02:22.080> boy

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
in we basically just blend that bad boy

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.670 
in we basically just blend that bad boy
back<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.620> till<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.700> emulsified<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
back up till it's emulsified we do it on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.650 
back up till it's emulsified we do it on
a<00:02:25.709> low<00:02:25.950> speed<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.550> do<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.790> incorporate<00:02:27.090> air

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
a low speed so we do not incorporate air

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
a low speed so we do not incorporate air
back<00:02:28.620> into<00:02:28.830> our<00:02:29.010> tofu<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.300> product<00:02:31.459> that

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
back into our tofu is a product that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.620 
back into our tofu is a product that
looks<00:02:32.519> exactly<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.150> tofu<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.480> now

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
looks exactly like tofu but it now

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.040 
looks exactly like tofu but it now
tastes<00:02:37.080> nice<00:02:38.540> I'm<00:02:39.540> gonna<00:02:39.690> take<00:02:39.840> plastic<00:02:40.200> cup
