and I was looking at the CBR 250r which
is<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> better<00:00:30.480> bike<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.820> kind<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is a better bike for me well kind of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.070 
is a better bike for me well kind of
falls<00:00:33.000> back<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.330> same<00:00:33.510> question<00:00:33.900> on<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
falls back to the same question on the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.450 
falls back to the same question on the
ground<00:00:34.290> being<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:34.710> beginner<00:00:35.010> bike<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
ground being a good beginner bike you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.780 
ground being a good beginner bike you
know<00:00:35.580> what<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:35.879> you<00:00:35.970> using<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> for

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
know what are you using it for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.920 
know what are you using it for
motorcycles<00:00:39.470> nice<00:00:40.470> I<00:00:41.239> actually<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.600> some<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
motorcycles nice I actually like some of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.969 
motorcycles nice I actually like some of
that<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:44.460> you're<00:00:44.699> using<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.269> Grom<00:00:46.049> as<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.739> bike

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
that if you're using the Grom as a bike

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.670 
that if you're using the Grom as a bike
where<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.580> go<00:00:47.780> 35<00:00:48.780> miles<00:00:49.049> a<00:00:49.229> day<00:00:49.260> at

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
where you have to go 35 miles a day at

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.670 
where you have to go 35 miles a day at
60<00:00:50.040> miles<00:00:50.250> an<00:00:50.400> hour<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.080> what<00:00:52.229> maybe<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
60 miles an hour you know what maybe the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
60 miles an hour you know what maybe the
bike<00:00:52.830> could<00:00:53.129> handle<00:00:53.549> it<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.780> wouldn't<00:00:54.960> do

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
bike could handle it but I wouldn't do

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.469 
bike could handle it but I wouldn't do
that<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.650> that's<00:00:55.979> really<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.119> what<00:00:57.269> it<00:00:57.390> was

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
that to it that's really not what it was

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.400 
that to it that's really not what it was
designed<00:00:57.600> for

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.530 

and<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:06.070> seems<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.520> little<00:01:06.640> extreme<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.480> a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
and that seems a little extreme of a

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.320 
and that seems a little extreme of a
usage<00:01:07.870> of<00:01:07.960> your<00:01:08.110> drum<00:01:08.320> at<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.100> same<00:01:09.160> time<00:01:09.580> you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
usage of your drum at the same time you

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.240 
usage of your drum at the same time you
know<00:01:10.450> if<00:01:10.690> you're<00:01:10.870> if<00:01:11.650> you're<00:01:11.770> looking<00:01:11.800> for<00:01:12.130> an

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
know if you're if you're looking for an

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.890 
know if you're if you're looking for an
efficient<00:01:12.670> city-dwelling<00:01:13.240> kind<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.720> bike<00:01:13.870> a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
efficient city-dwelling kind of a bike a

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.390 
efficient city-dwelling kind of a bike a
commuter<00:01:14.470> bike<00:01:14.650> well<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:15.040> know<00:01:15.160> what<00:01:15.340> the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
commuter bike well you know what the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.310 
commuter bike well you know what the
girl<00:01:15.610> will<00:01:15.730> do<00:01:15.790> great<00:01:16.030> just<00:01:16.960> depends<00:01:17.260> on

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
girl will do great just depends on

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.110 
girl will do great just depends on
mileage<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:17.770> all<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:17.980> stuff<00:01:18.190> now<00:01:18.850> if<00:01:18.970> you're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
mileage and all that stuff now if you're

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.800 
mileage and all that stuff now if you're
comparing<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.690> CBR<00:01:20.260> 250<00:01:21.010> well<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.600> two

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
comparing it to CBR 250 well the two

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.990 
comparing it to CBR 250 well the two
bikes<00:01:23.050> for<00:01:23.290> two<00:01:23.410> different<00:01:23.590> purposes<00:01:24.000> what

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
bikes for two different purposes what

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.030 
bikes for two different purposes what
was<00:01:25.120> your<00:01:25.270> reason<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.660> asking<00:01:26.110> about<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.740> CBR

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
was your reason and asking about the CBR

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.340 
was your reason and asking about the CBR
250<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:27.880> because<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.210> wanted<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.540> be<00:01:28.690> able

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
250 is it because you wanted to be able

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.140 
250 is it because you wanted to be able
to<00:01:29.440> go<00:01:29.500> out<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.860> ride<00:01:30.010> canyon<00:01:30.460> roads<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.000> keep

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
to go out and ride canyon roads and keep

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.700 
to go out and ride canyon roads and keep
up<00:01:31.330> with<00:01:31.450> other<00:01:31.600> sport<00:01:31.930> bikes<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.320> have<00:01:32.470> fun

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
up with other sport bikes and have fun

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.530 
up with other sport bikes and have fun
but<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.310> know<00:01:33.640> still<00:01:34.000> have<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.300> capability

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
but you know still have that capability

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.530 
but you know still have that capability
to<00:01:35.170> get<00:01:35.229> on<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.410> highway<00:01:35.590> should<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.100> need<00:01:36.220> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to get on the highway should you need it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.660 
to get on the highway should you need it
well<00:01:37.540> if<00:01:37.720> that's<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.990> case<00:01:38.229> then<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.830> CBR<00:01:39.250> 250

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
well if that's the case then the CBR 250

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.630 
well if that's the case then the CBR 250
is<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.790> lot<00:01:39.940> better<00:01:40.030> choice<00:01:40.420> between<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:41.020> two<00:01:41.050> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is a lot better choice between the two I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.550 
is a lot better choice between the two I
mean<00:01:42.640> it's<00:01:42.820> an<00:01:42.880> obvious<00:01:43.330> choice<00:01:43.540> because<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
mean it's an obvious choice because the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.190 
mean it's an obvious choice because the
CBR<00:01:44.860> 250<00:01:45.460> will<00:01:45.729> go<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.390> know<00:01:46.509> 90<00:01:46.900> miles<00:01:47.080> an

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
CBR 250 will go you know 90 miles an

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.150 
CBR 250 will go you know 90 miles an
hour<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:47.619> if<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.770> have<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> get<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
hour so if you have to get in the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.790 
hour so if you have to get in the
highway<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.810> mean<00:01:49.810> yeah<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.110> Grom<00:01:50.290> will<00:01:50.500> do<00:01:50.650> it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
highway I mean yeah the Grom will do it

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.900 
highway I mean yeah the Grom will do it
but<00:01:50.950> you're<00:01:51.070> topped<00:01:51.310> out<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.550> mean<00:01:51.820> you're

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
but you're topped out I mean you're

sitting there I mean literally right at

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.410 
sitting there I mean literally right at
your<00:01:53.710> rev<00:01:53.920> limiter<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.460> you're<00:01:54.970> going<00:01:55.270> you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
your rev limiter and you're going you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.030 
your rev limiter and you're going you
know<00:01:55.509> eight<00:01:55.720> eight<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> half<00:01:56.290> thousand<00:01:56.920> rpm

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
know eight eight and a half thousand rpm

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.999 
know eight eight and a half thousand rpm
the<00:01:57.610> cruise<00:01:57.850> down<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.630> highway<00:01:59.110> you're

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
the cruise down the highway you're

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:00.900 
the cruise down the highway you're
pretty<00:02:00.369> much<00:02:00.520> doing

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
pretty much doing

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.560 
pretty much doing
maximum<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.110> do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.260 

whereas<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> CBR<00:02:05.830> 250<00:02:06.490> you've<00:02:06.820> got<00:02:07.000> plenty

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
whereas on a CBR 250 you've got plenty

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.690 
whereas on a CBR 250 you've got plenty
of<00:02:07.510> long-winded<00:02:08.410> nough<00:02:08.710> sand<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.979> bike<00:02:09.160> if

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
of long-winded nough sand the bike if

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520 
of long-winded nough sand the bike if
you<00:02:09.820> need<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> cruise<00:02:10.270> 60<00:02:10.630> 65<00:02:11.050> miles<00:02:11.320> an<00:02:11.410> hour

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you need to cruise 60 65 miles an hour

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.190 
you need to cruise 60 65 miles an hour
you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.250> do<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:13.900> hurting<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you can do that and it's not hurting the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.790 
you can do that and it's not hurting the
bike<00:02:14.320> at<00:02:14.470> all

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
bike at all

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.690 
bike at all
so<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:17.830> not<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.340> bike<00:02:18.520> is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
so you know it's not that one bike is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.640 
so you know it's not that one bike is
better<00:02:18.940> than<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.300> other<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.660> CBR<00:02:19.959> 250<00:02:20.530> is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
better than the other the CBR 250 is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.320 
better than the other the CBR 250 is
bigger<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.520> heavier<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.120> more

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
bigger it is heavier it is more

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.030 
bigger it is heavier it is more
expensive<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.870> put<00:02:23.080> tires<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.890> more

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
expensive to put tires on it is more

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
expensive to put tires on it is more
expensive<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.520> maintain

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
expensive to maintain

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.060 
expensive to maintain
etc<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.400> know<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.670> just<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:28.030> more<00:02:28.360> everything

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
etc you know it just is more everything

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.860 
etc you know it just is more everything
well<00:02:30.070> you're<00:02:30.220> also<00:02:30.340> getting<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:31.150> bike<00:02:31.510> you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
well you're also getting more bike you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.890 
well you're also getting more bike you
can<00:02:32.050> go<00:02:32.230> faster<00:02:32.890> okay<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.180> cruise<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
can go faster okay you can cruise on the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
can go faster okay you can cruise on the
highway<00:02:35.440> more<00:02:35.680> easily<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:36.520> longer

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
highway more easily you can go longer

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.060 
highway more easily you can go longer
distances<00:02:37.690> you've<00:02:37.900> got<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> bigger<00:02:38.320> gas<00:02:38.680> tank

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
distances you've got a bigger gas tank

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.790 
distances you've got a bigger gas tank
the<00:02:39.780> ergonomic<00:02:40.780> position<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.709> bit

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the ergonomic position is a little bit

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.229 
the ergonomic position is a little bit
better<00:02:41.980> because<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.520> physically<00:02:43.030> bigger

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
better because it's a physically bigger

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.360 
better because it's a physically bigger
bike<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.290> bigger<00:02:44.470> people<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.160> myself

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
bike so for bigger people like myself

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.400 
bike so for bigger people like myself
you<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.790> if<00:02:45.910> you're<00:02:46.060> 60<00:02:46.420> tall<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.020> Grom<00:02:47.200> is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
you know if you're 60 tall the Grom is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.470 
you know if you're 60 tall the Grom is
kind<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.680> comically<00:02:48.130> small<00:02:48.400> butts<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:48.970> fun<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
kind of comically small butts so fun and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.260 
kind of comically small butts so fun and
it's<00:02:49.780> actually<00:02:50.320> quite<00:02:50.440> comfortable<00:02:51.209> but<00:02:52.209> if

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
it's actually quite comfortable but if

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.850 
it's actually quite comfortable but if
you<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.540> commute<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.110> long<00:02:53.320> distances

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
you have to commute on it long distances

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.170 
you have to commute on it long distances
everyday<00:02:54.190> you'd<00:02:54.489> probably<00:02:54.670> want<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> bigger

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
everyday you'd probably want a bigger

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.699 
everyday you'd probably want a bigger
bike<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:55.660> for<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> extra<00:02:56.050> comfort<00:02:56.440> or<00:02:56.560> maybe

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
bike just for the extra comfort or maybe

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.259 
bike just for the extra comfort or maybe
the<00:02:56.830> ability<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.130> put<00:02:57.280> saddle<00:02:57.580> bags<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
the ability to put saddle bags on it and

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.180 
the ability to put saddle bags on it and
kind<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.450> carry<00:02:59.080> stuff<00:02:59.350> around<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.040> so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
kind of carry stuff around with you so

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.410 
kind of carry stuff around with you so
there's<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.430> lot<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.640> situations<00:03:00.820> where<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
there's a lot of situations where the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.390 
there's a lot of situations where the
Grom<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.019> good<00:03:02.260> bike<00:03:02.440> for<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.980> it's

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
Grom is not a good bike for you it's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.610 
Grom is not a good bike for you it's
still<00:03:03.580> good<00:03:03.760> bike<00:03:03.940> though<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.530> those

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
still good bike though and in those

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.990 
still good bike though and in those
situations<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.519> need<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> evaluate

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
situations I think you need to evaluate

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
situations I think you need to evaluate
what<00:03:07.269> you're<00:03:07.630> planning<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.959> use<00:03:08.410> them<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:09.130> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
what you're planning to use them for and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.280 
what you're planning to use them for and
determine<00:03:10.030> whether<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.360> CBR<00:03:10.690> 250<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.260> a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
determine whether the CBR 250 is a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.690 
determine whether the CBR 250 is a
better<00:03:11.470> choice<00:03:11.709> than<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.950> Grom<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.489> really

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
better choice than the Grom it's really

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.979 
better choice than the Grom it's really
based<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:12.970> your<00:03:13.150> usage<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:16.000> guess<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> really

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
based on your usage so I guess it really

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.570 
based on your usage so I guess it really
just<00:03:17.260> depends<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.220> kind<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.400> back<00:03:18.549> to

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
just depends on you it's kind of back to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.160 
just depends on you it's kind of back to
you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.299> Grom<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> good<00:03:19.750> first<00:03:19.959> bike

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
you know is the Grom a good first bike

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.170 
you know is the Grom a good first bike
Oh<00:03:20.440> same<00:03:20.799> thing<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.250> know<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.000> Grom

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
Oh same thing you know is the Grom

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.600 
Oh same thing you know is the Grom
better<00:03:22.450> than<00:03:22.600> CBR<00:03:22.959> 250<00:03:23.440> well<00:03:23.769> yeah<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.459> you're

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
better than CBR 250 well yeah if you're

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.520 
better than CBR 250 well yeah if you're
living<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.000> college<00:03:25.870> campus<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.380> never

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
living on a college campus you never

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
CBR 250 is a lot better choice so it

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.430 
CBR 250 is a lot better choice so it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
