00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.040
 you are wondering why I dance like that 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.890
 very bollywood style india because today 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.820
 in my video tutorial I want to explain 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.079
 how to make a drawing n all 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.480
 what helen is essentially 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.390
 this goodbye is not seen well but I hope 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.120
 to let me see as much as possible if I do 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.030
 spiro comes out this kind of pandino 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.640
 here they are a mixture of which derives from 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.130
 a plant are herbal things marian not there 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.230
 I can say precisely but I will do another 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.630
 small research veil put or software 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.780
 I will write it nothing brought me one 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.750
 my friend from India well I realized 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.180
 a typical tattoo you have present 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
 in Bollywood movies when women 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.129
 Indians get married 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 here is they come back with these drawings 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.420
 this is precisely what I did 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.720
 let's say I went there a lot 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.710
 nose is more than anything I did style 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.140
 free hand 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.600
 I did not follow a drawing well 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.330
 precise world does a lot of fantasy and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 this was precisely the result 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.450
 but if you feel insecure and want 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 you can't miss completely 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.390
 let's say look on the internet and gave it 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.350
 to download some pictures of the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 I certainly recommend recopying 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.940
 practice first on a sheet of paper because 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.530
 soon this connection is not for nothing 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.229
 easy to use 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 there is always a need for some manual skills 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.520
 so now in the video I'll explain how 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.520
 realize your all one
