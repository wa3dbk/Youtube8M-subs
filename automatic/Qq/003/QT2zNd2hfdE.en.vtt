like<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.239> structural<00:01:06.680> reinforcements<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
like it's structural reinforcements to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.600 
like it's structural reinforcements to
the<00:01:07.979> brick<00:01:08.250> into<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.180> foundation<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.920> brought

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the brick into the foundation I brought

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
the brick into the foundation I brought
it<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.380> well

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it up all the way into there as well

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
it up all the way into there as well
even<00:01:14.280> though<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.430> can't<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
even though you can't see it from the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
even though you can't see it from the
outside<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> came<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.750> really

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
outside but I think it came out really

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.100 
outside but I think it came out really
good<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.369> matched<00:01:20.820> almost<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
good they just matched almost what the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
good they just matched almost what the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
doing with the structural reinforcements

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.790 
debating on how high I wanted the arch
and<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.200> where<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> wanted<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and and where I wanted the the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.280 
and and where I wanted the the
curvatures<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.390> what<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> did<00:02:34.690> with<00:02:35.020> this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
curvatures and so what I did with this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.720 
curvatures and so what I did with this
stencil<00:02:35.650> once<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.280> was<00:02:36.489> done<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.380> taped<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
stencil once I was done I taped it to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.070 
stencil once I was done I taped it to
the<00:02:39.760> foam<00:02:40.420> back<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:42.280> board<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.480> he<00:02:43.510> didn't<00:02:43.900> move

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the foam back on board so he didn't move

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.500 
the foam back on board so he didn't move
while<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> made<00:02:44.830> my<00:02:45.040> trace<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.209> cut<00:02:46.480> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
while I made my trace and then I cut it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.130 
while I made my trace and then I cut it
with<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> razor<00:02:47.350> blade<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:48.070> very<00:02:48.250> slowly<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:50.110> I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
with a razor blade just very slowly so I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.199 
with a razor blade just very slowly so I
can<00:02:50.440> get<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.739> final<00:02:51.010> product<00:02:51.370> which<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.000> this

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
can get the final product which is this

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.320 
can get the final product which is this
and<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:54.280> again<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:56.620> are<00:02:56.860> only<00:02:57.160> about<00:02:57.519> a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
and then again these are only about a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.720 
and then again these are only about a
quarter<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.989> an<00:02:59.080> inch<00:02:59.230> thick<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.580> pretty

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
quarter of an inch thick so it's pretty

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
quarter of an inch thick so it's pretty
much<00:03:00.850> actually<00:03:01.299> squared<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.870> quarter<00:03:02.170> inch<00:03:02.290> by

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
much actually squared a quarter inch by

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.979 
much actually squared a quarter inch by
quarter<00:03:02.650> inch<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.760> around<00:03:04.239> but<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.600> came<00:03:04.810> out

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
quarter inch all around but it came out

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.050 
quarter inch all around but it came out
really<00:03:05.320> good

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
really good

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
really good
I<00:03:07.120> bought<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.140> brick<00:03:08.680> paper<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:12.510> bought<00:03:13.510> this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I bought this brick paper I bought this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.580 
I bought this brick paper I bought this
sheet<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.400> brick<00:03:15.790> paper<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.140> craft<00:03:17.410> store

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
sheet of brick paper just a craft store

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.819 
sheet of brick paper just a craft store
to<00:03:18.459> actually<00:03:18.820> use<00:03:19.000> them<00:03:19.239> they<00:03:20.230> actually<00:03:20.380> use

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
to actually use them they actually use

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.640 
to actually use them they actually use
them<00:03:21.070> for<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.060> mission<00:03:22.540> playsets<00:03:23.470> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
them for the mission playsets and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.520 
them for the mission playsets and
whatnot

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
whatnot

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.920 
whatnot
then<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:27.510> saw<00:03:28.080> mine<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.740> printables<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.540> made

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
then I saw mine at printables and I made

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.890 
then I saw mine at printables and I made
a<00:03:30.959> couple<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.470> copies<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.270> it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
a couple of copies of this and it

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.650 
a couple of copies of this and it
equaled<00:03:34.319> out<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.770> almost<00:03:34.950> be<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> same<00:03:35.700> amount

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
equaled out to almost be the same amount

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.070 
equaled out to almost be the same amount
of<00:03:36.900> money<00:03:37.550> it's<00:03:38.550> just<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.690> smaller

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
of money it's just I like the smaller

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440 
of money it's just I like the smaller
brick<00:03:40.560> since<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.250> figures<00:03:41.610> are<00:03:41.970> smaller

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
brick since the figures are smaller

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.780 
brick since the figures are smaller
scale<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.650> looks<00:03:43.830> like<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.160> their<00:03:44.370> scale

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
scale it looks like it's their scale

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.750 
scale it looks like it's their scale
where<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.050> would<00:03:46.440> see<00:03:46.739> how<00:03:47.100> big<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.520> brick

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
where if you would see how big the brick

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.510 
where if you would see how big the brick
is<00:03:47.970> here<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.410> huh<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.890> don't<00:03:50.040> think<00:03:50.400> it

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
is here you know huh I don't think it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.970 
is here you know huh I don't think it
would<00:03:50.610> look<00:03:51.120> too<00:03:51.300> good<00:03:51.569> it's<00:03:52.319> good<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.800> maybe

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
would look too good it's good for maybe

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.800 
would look too good it's good for maybe
a<00:03:53.069> side<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.580> building<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.150> something<00:03:54.450> but

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
a side of a building or something but

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.729 
a side of a building or something but
not<00:03:54.900> inside<00:03:56.150> something<00:03:57.150> such<00:03:57.330> detailed<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.709> I

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
not inside something such detailed but I

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.440 
not inside something such detailed but I
bought<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> couple<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.790> bucks<00:03:59.970> and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
bought this for a couple of bucks and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.880 
bought this for a couple of bucks and
those<00:04:02.600> equaled<00:04:03.600> roughly<00:04:04.500> around<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.800> same<00:04:05.239> so

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
those equaled roughly around the same so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.160 
those equaled roughly around the same so
again<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.280> making<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> custom<00:04:09.660> Batcave

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
again this is making a custom Batcave

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.979 
again this is making a custom Batcave
part<00:04:10.470> six<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:12.030> know<00:04:12.150> let<00:04:12.480> me<00:04:12.600> know<00:04:12.840> if

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
part six and you know let me know if

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.530 
part six and you know let me know if
there's<00:04:13.290> any<00:04:13.489> questions<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:15.030> may<00:04:15.180> have

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
there's any questions you may have

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.020 
there's any questions you may have
I<00:04:15.900> try<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.590> shine<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.070> little<00:04:17.310> light<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.850> so

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
I try to shine a little light on it so

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.080 
I try to shine a little light on it so
you<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.239> really<00:04:18.510> see<00:04:19.190> how<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.340> came<00:04:20.549> out<00:04:20.790> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
you can really see how it came out it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.150 
you can really see how it came out it
came<00:04:21.120> out<00:04:21.390> really<00:04:21.690> good<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.470> once<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.860> build

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
came out really good and once I build

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.240 
came out really good and once I build
the<00:04:23.870> computer<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:27.020> bolt<00:04:28.020> I'm<00:04:28.740> gonna<00:04:28.919> do<00:04:29.220> a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
the computer and the bolt I'm gonna do a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.010 
the computer and the bolt I'm gonna do a
slide<00:04:30.210> show<00:04:30.919> using<00:04:31.919> this<00:04:32.729> as<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> background<00:04:33.419> or

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
slide show using this as a background or

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.360 
slide show using this as a background or
the<00:04:34.530> main<00:04:34.680> stage<00:04:35.070> for<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:35.940> then<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.360> didn't

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
the main stage for it and then I didn't

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.400 
the main stage for it and then I didn't
secure<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.640> because<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.510> want<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> remove<00:04:40.140> it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
secure this because I want to remove it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
my son had a good idea of he goes well

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.130 
my son had a good idea of he goes well
where's<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.630> batboat<00:04:43.140> go<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.750> want<00:04:45.990> we

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
where's the batboat go and so we want we

where's the batboat go and so we want we
can<00:04:46.260> remove<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.860> put<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.280> batboat<00:04:47.760> and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
can remove this and put the batboat and
