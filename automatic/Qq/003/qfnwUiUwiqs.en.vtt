to say I would have to really look at

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.969 
to say I would have to really look at
long-term<00:01:53.970> durability<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:55.110> people<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.680> kind

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
long-term durability from people as kind

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
long-term durability from people as kind
of<00:01:56.100> reports<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.850> headphone<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.619> think

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of reports of this headphone I think

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
of reports of this headphone I think
that<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.070> should<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.579> pretty<00:01:59.880> well-built

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that it should be a pretty well-built

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
that it should be a pretty well-built
headphone<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.200> apart<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> kind<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
headphone on apart from the kind of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.340 
headphone on apart from the kind of
general<00:02:03.360> light<00:02:03.570> weight<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
general light weight it does have a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.069 
general light weight it does have a
decent<00:02:04.619> build<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.869> an

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
decent build to it it is also an

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.669 
decent build to it it is also an
extremely<00:02:07.879> compact<00:02:08.879> headphone<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
extremely compact headphone because you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.870 
extremely compact headphone because you
can<00:02:10.860> basically<00:02:11.039> fold<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.709> into

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
can basically fold this up into

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.660 
can basically fold this up into
this<00:02:14.570> kind<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.170> tiny<00:02:15.530> shape<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.340> which<00:02:16.550> is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
this kind of tiny shape here which is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this kind of tiny shape here which is
really<00:02:16.940> remarkable

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
really remarkable

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.450 
really remarkable
the<00:02:17.900> only<00:02:18.110> other<00:02:18.320> headphone<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.980> I've<00:02:19.130> seen

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
the only other headphone that I've seen

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.820 
the only other headphone that I've seen
that<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.820> fold<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.210> into<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.660> smaller<00:02:21.260> shape<00:02:21.560> is

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
that can fold up into a smaller shape is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.750 
that can fold up into a smaller shape is
the<00:02:22.280> cost

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
the cost

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.990 
the cost

with drivers attached sorry a headband
with<00:02:30.290> drivers<00:02:30.740> attached<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.420> extremely

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
with drivers attached so it's extremely

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.170

suppose<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.950> big<00:02:46.520> selling<00:02:47.000> point<00:02:47.270> for

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
suppose this is a big selling point for

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.010 
suppose this is a big selling point for
the<00:02:47.830> soundtrue<00:02:49.210> um<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.420> other<00:02:50.540> thing<00:02:50.660> about

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
the soundtrue um the other thing about

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.440 
the soundtrue um the other thing about
the<00:02:51.230> bose<00:02:51.470> soundtrue<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.850> does<00:02:53.090> have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
the bose soundtrue is that it does have

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.920 
the bose soundtrue is that it does have
a<00:02:53.690> detachable<00:02:54.410> cable<00:02:54.710> though<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> uses<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.510> what

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
a detachable cable though it uses a what

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.650 
a detachable cable though it uses a what
looks<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.880> proprietary<00:02:58.880> connector<00:02:59.510> so

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
looks like a proprietary connector so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.700 
looks like a proprietary connector so
you're<00:02:59.780> not<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.140> be<00:03:00.200> able<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.380> replace

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
you're not going to be able to replace

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.100 
you're not going to be able to replace
it<00:03:00.920> with<00:03:00.950> any<00:03:01.190> aftermarket<00:03:01.910> cables<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.020> a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
it with any aftermarket cables this is a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.400 
it with any aftermarket cables this is a
four<00:03:03.440> pin<00:03:03.910> maybe<00:03:04.910> even<00:03:05.180> smaller<00:03:05.480> than<00:03:05.600> 2.5

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
four pin maybe even smaller than 2.5

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.740 
four pin maybe even smaller than 2.5
millimeter<00:03:06.830> I'm<00:03:06.980> not<00:03:07.130> sure<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.390> you're<00:03:08.660> gonna

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
millimeter I'm not sure so you're gonna

smartphone remote on it and the actual
cable<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:17.050> it's<00:03:18.050> not<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.260> greatest<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.010> terms

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
cable is it's not the greatest in terms

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.940 
cable is it's not the greatest in terms
of<00:03:19.460> quality<00:03:20.000> as<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.380> retains<00:03:21.800> a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
of quality as you can see it retains a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.280 
of quality as you can see it retains a
fair<00:03:22.190> bit<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.400> memory<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:23.690> not<00:03:23.870> particularly

fair bit of memory it's not particularly

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.680 
fair bit of memory it's not particularly

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300

about<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.710> connector<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.540> a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
about this connector is that it is a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.510 
about this connector is that it is a
straight<00:03:39.050> angle<00:03:39.260> connector<00:03:39.890> which<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.160> really

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
straight angle connector which is really

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.750 
straight angle connector which is really
quite<00:03:40.700> unfortunate<00:03:41.360> because<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.740> is<00:03:43.250> gonna

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
quite unfortunate because it is gonna

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.160 
quite unfortunate because it is gonna
stick<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.210> your<00:03:44.330> pocket<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.810> little<00:03:44.930> bit

stick out of your pocket a little bit

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.780 
stick out of your pocket a little bit
and<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.350> would<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.620> preferred<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.100> 90<00:03:46.400> degree

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.210 
and I would have preferred a 90 degree
angle<00:03:47.230> connector<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.620> that's<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.890> bit<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.130> an

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
angle connector so that's a bit of an

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.000 
angle connector so that's a bit of an
oversight<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.270> moving<00:03:50.570> on<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.720> comfort<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
oversight so moving on to comfort the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.210 
oversight so moving on to comfort the
bose<00:03:52.280> soundtrue<00:03:52.730> on-ear<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.830> probably<00:03:54.830> be

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
bose soundtrue on-ear is probably be

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.360 
bose soundtrue on-ear is probably be
most<00:03:55.940> comfortable<00:03:56.660> on<00:03:56.870> ear<00:03:57.260> headphone<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.010> I

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
most comfortable on ear headphone that I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.210 
most comfortable on ear headphone that I
have<00:03:58.550> ever<00:03:58.820> tried<00:03:59.210> and<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.500> both<00:04:00.710> because

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
have ever tried and this is both because

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.110 
have ever tried and this is both because
of<00:04:01.460> its<00:04:02.110> low<00:04:03.110> clamping<00:04:03.830> force<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.400> also

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
of its low clamping force and also

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.560 
of its low clamping force and also
because<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.320> its<00:04:06.350> very<00:04:06.980> very<00:04:07.100> light<00:04:07.580> weight<00:04:07.880> so

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
because of its very very light weight so

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.630 
because of its very very light weight so
it's<00:04:09.170> you're<00:04:09.860> not<00:04:09.980> going<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.160> completely

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
it's you're not going to completely

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.550 
it's you're not going to completely
forget<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.270> it's<00:04:11.390> on<00:04:11.570> your<00:04:11.750> ears<00:04:12.020> because<00:04:12.260> it

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
forget that it's on your ears because it

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.170 
forget that it's on your ears because it
actually<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.160> sitting<00:04:13.430> right<00:04:13.640> on<00:04:13.670> top<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:14.000> your

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
actually is sitting right on top of your

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.120 
actually is sitting right on top of your
ears<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:14.750> still<00:04:15.170> gonna<00:04:15.350> touch<00:04:15.980> your

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
ears and it's still gonna touch your

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.099 
ears and it's still gonna touch your
skin<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.700> not<00:04:17.060> everyone<00:04:17.480> loves<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.989> ear

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
skin and and not everyone loves on ear

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.900 
skin and and not everyone loves on ear
headphones<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.950> reason<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:19.609> apart

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
headphones for that reason but apart

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.570 
headphones for that reason but apart
from<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.739> they<00:04:21.739> are<00:04:21.770> headphones<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.460> are

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
from that they are headphones that are

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.150 
from that they are headphones that are
very<00:04:22.850> very<00:04:23.150> easy<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.870> just<00:04:24.050> wear<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:24.800> hours

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
very very easy to just wear for hours

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.670 
very very easy to just wear for hours
and<00:04:25.280> hours<00:04:25.630> because<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.110> low<00:04:27.350> clasp

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
and hours because of the low clasp

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.650 
and hours because of the low clasp
I think<00:04:27.919> force<00:04:28.190> they<00:04:28.669> don't<00:04:28.880> feel<00:04:29.090> as<00:04:29.270> stable

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
I think force they don't feel as stable

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.499 
I think force they don't feel as stable
on<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.229> head<00:04:30.500> as<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:30.770> think<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.550> they<00:04:31.729> could

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
on the head as I think that they could

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.990 
on the head as I think that they could
feel<00:04:33.070> they're<00:04:34.070> certainly<00:04:34.400> not<00:04:34.490> going<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.880> be

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
feel they're certainly not going to be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.610 
feel they're certainly not going to be
good<00:04:35.240> for<00:04:35.479> running<00:04:35.930> or<00:04:36.139> anything<00:04:36.259> like<00:04:36.560> that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
good for running or anything like that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.290 
good for running or anything like that
they're<00:04:37.280> not<00:04:37.310> gonna<00:04:37.520> fall<00:04:37.789> right<00:04:38.030> off<00:04:38.180> your

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
they're not gonna fall right off your

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.090 
they're not gonna fall right off your
head<00:04:38.360> if<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.810> are<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.440> know<00:04:39.530> do<00:04:39.710> some<00:04:39.889> head

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
head if you are you know do some head

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.439 
head if you are you know do some head
banging<00:04:40.370> or<00:04:40.580> anything<00:04:40.789> like<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:41.330> they

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
banging or anything like that but they

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.950 
banging or anything like that but they
will<00:04:41.660> shift<00:04:41.990> around<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.590> bit<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.389> they<00:04:44.389> are<00:04:44.600> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
will shift around a bit so they are a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.930 
will shift around a bit so they are a
little<00:04:45.320> less<00:04:45.800> stable<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> head<00:04:46.759> than

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
little less stable on the head than

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.990 
little less stable on the head than
something<00:04:47.180> like<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.720> sennheiser<00:04:48.020> amperior

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
something like the sennheiser amperior

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.390 
something like the sennheiser amperior
and<00:04:50.000> also<00:04:50.660> noise<00:04:50.990> isolation<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.190> bose

and also noise isolation on the bose
soundtrue<00:04:52.850> on-ear<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.590> little<00:04:54.860> bit<00:04:54.979> on

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
soundtrue on-ear is just a little bit on

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.800 
soundtrue on-ear is just a little bit on
the<00:04:55.190> poorer<00:04:55.490> side<00:04:55.850> you<00:04:56.060> do<00:04:56.270> find<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.660> you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
the poorer side you do find that you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.810 
the poorer side you do find that you
have<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.110> turn<00:04:57.289> up<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.650> volume<00:04:57.680> just<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.669> get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
have to turn up the volume just to get

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.420 
have to turn up the volume just to get
above<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.330> average<00:04:59.930> background<00:05:00.530> noise<00:05:01.009> so

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
above the average background noise so

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.939 
above the average background noise so
how<00:05:01.699> did<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.940> bose<00:05:02.210> soundtrue<00:05:02.750> on-ear<00:05:03.080> sound

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
how did the bose soundtrue on-ear sound

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.820 
how did the bose soundtrue on-ear sound
well<00:05:04.759> after<00:05:05.449> listening<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.229> for<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.560> while

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
well after listening to this for a while

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.850 
well after listening to this for a while
I<00:05:07.130> now<00:05:07.430> understand<00:05:08.090> why<00:05:08.419> opinions<00:05:09.259> on<00:05:09.560> boys

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
I now understand why opinions on boys

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.640 
I now understand why opinions on boys
can<00:05:10.220> be<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.789> divided<00:05:11.509> because<00:05:12.020> this<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:12.620> a

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
can be so divided because this is a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.469 
can be so divided because this is a
headphone<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:14.180> is<00:05:15.490> offensive<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.150> point

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
headphone that is offensive to the point

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.710 
headphone that is offensive to the point
of<00:05:17.690> being<00:05:18.220> offensive<00:05:19.220> what<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> mean<00:05:20.509> by<00:05:20.690> that

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
of being offensive what I mean by that

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.320 
of being offensive what I mean by that
is<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.289> the<00:05:21.560> soundtrue<00:05:22.250> has<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.460> really<00:05:23.000> warm

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
is that the soundtrue has a really warm

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.540 
is that the soundtrue has a really warm
agreeable<00:05:24.229> sound<00:05:24.620> it's<00:05:24.830> definitely<00:05:25.310> been

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
agreeable sound it's definitely been

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.230 
agreeable sound it's definitely been
tuned<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.479> a<00:05:26.509> specific<00:05:26.979> kind<00:05:27.979> of<00:05:28.280> signature<00:05:28.789> it

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
tuned to a specific kind of signature it

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.040 
tuned to a specific kind of signature it
has<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:30.199> surprising<00:05:31.099> amount<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.729> bass<00:05:32.120> for<00:05:32.870> such

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
has a surprising amount of bass for such

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.210 
has a surprising amount of bass for such
a<00:05:33.080> small<00:05:33.560> headphone

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
a small headphone

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.839 
a small headphone
the<00:05:34.909> mids<00:05:35.270> are<00:05:35.539> smooth<00:05:36.250> there's<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.310> nice

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
the mids are smooth there's a nice

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.659 
the mids are smooth there's a nice
amount<00:05:38.210> of<00:05:38.449> energy<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.199> the<00:05:39.289> vocals<00:05:39.740> but<00:05:40.370> where

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
amount of energy to the vocals but where

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.300 
amount of energy to the vocals but where
it<00:05:41.449> really<00:05:41.479> runs<00:05:41.990> into<00:05:42.229> trouble<00:05:42.620> is<00:05:42.800> with<00:05:43.099> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
it really runs into trouble is with the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.360 
it really runs into trouble is with the
treble<00:05:43.880> because<00:05:44.479> the<00:05:44.900> treble<00:05:45.349> is<00:05:45.560> rolled<00:05:46.070> off

treble because the treble is rolled off

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.180 
treble because the treble is rolled off
on<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:47.060> bose<00:05:47.810> soundtrue<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.560> it's<00:05:48.680> rolled

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
on the bose soundtrue and it's rolled

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.890 
on the bose soundtrue and it's rolled
off<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.580> way<00:05:49.760> that<00:05:49.970> it<00:05:50.240> doesn't<00:05:50.780> make<00:05:50.840> it

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
off in a way that it doesn't make it

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.460 
off in a way that it doesn't make it
sound<00:05:51.139> congested<00:05:52.039> but<00:05:52.669> it<00:05:52.909> does<00:05:53.240> mean<00:05:53.630> that<00:05:53.690> it

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
sound congested but it does mean that it

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.439 
sound congested but it does mean that it
is<00:05:54.800> rolled<00:05:55.130> off<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.550> point<00:05:55.729> where<00:05:56.030> it

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
is rolled off to the point where it

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.560 
is rolled off to the point where it
really<00:05:56.539> is<00:05:56.960> lacking<00:05:57.440> in<00:05:57.800> detail<00:05:58.580> in<00:05:58.909> terms<00:05:59.389> of

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
really is lacking in detail in terms of

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.649 
really is lacking in detail in terms of
sound<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.229> makes<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.830> soundstage<00:06:01.430> seem<00:06:02.360> more

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
sound and makes the soundstage seem more

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.870 
sound and makes the soundstage seem more
compressed<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.530> more<00:06:03.710> intimate<00:06:04.130> than<00:06:04.490> it

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
compressed and more intimate than it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.770 
compressed and more intimate than it
really<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:05.389> so<00:06:06.310> as<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.370> result<00:06:07.699> it's<00:06:08.240> it's<00:06:08.659> gonna

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
really is so as a result it's it's gonna

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.300 
really is so as a result it's it's gonna
be<00:06:08.960> a<00:06:08.990> headphone<00:06:09.380> that's<00:06:09.590> really<00:06:09.949> going<00:06:10.130> to<00:06:10.190> be

directly to anything else I could quite
enjoy<00:06:43.940> it<00:06:43.970> I<00:06:44.210> actually<00:06:44.360> think<00:06:44.690> it's<00:06:44.810> a<00:06:44.900> nice

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
enjoy it I actually think it's a nice

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.740 
enjoy it I actually think it's a nice
enough<00:06:45.410> tuning<00:06:45.860> but<00:06:46.370> as<00:06:46.490> soon<00:06:46.880> as<00:06:47.090> I<00:06:47.180> put<00:06:47.449> it<00:06:47.569> up

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
enough tuning but as soon as I put it up

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.749 
enough tuning but as soon as I put it up
against<00:06:48.229> anything<00:06:48.650> that's<00:06:48.860> in<00:06:49.250> its<00:06:49.400> kind<00:06:49.610> of

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 
against anything that's in its kind of

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.029 
against anything that's in its kind of
price<00:06:50.000> range<00:06:50.330> I<00:06:50.539> think<00:06:50.569> oh<00:06:50.930> I'm<00:06:51.319> missing<00:06:51.800> out<00:06:52.009> a

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
price range I think oh I'm missing out a

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.170 
price range I think oh I'm missing out a
lot<00:06:52.160> in<00:06:52.639> terms<00:06:52.880> of<00:06:53.500> of<00:06:54.500> energy<00:06:55.460> and<00:06:55.729> shimmer

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
lot in terms of of energy and shimmer

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.420 
lot in terms of of energy and shimmer
and<00:06:56.509> kind<00:06:56.780> of<00:06:56.900> detail<00:06:57.500> and<00:06:57.680> texture<00:06:58.009> in<00:06:58.250> the

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
and kind of detail and texture in the

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.150 
and kind of detail and texture in the
treble<00:06:58.669> looking<00:06:59.479> at<00:06:59.599> it<00:06:59.720> overall<00:07:00.050> I<00:07:00.470> think<00:07:00.680> the

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
treble looking at it overall I think the

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.270 
treble looking at it overall I think the
bose<00:07:01.550> soundtrue<00:07:02.090> doesn't<00:07:02.930> sound<00:07:03.229> bad<00:07:03.710> but<00:07:04.220> it

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
bose soundtrue doesn't sound bad but it

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.689 
bose soundtrue doesn't sound bad but it
is<00:07:04.789> a<00:07:05.090> bit<00:07:05.509> disappointing<00:07:06.160> for<00:07:07.160> the<00:07:07.280> retail

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
is a bit disappointing for the retail

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.589 
is a bit disappointing for the retail
price<00:07:08.169> if<00:07:09.169> it<00:07:09.349> was<00:07:09.530> priced<00:07:09.800> closer<00:07:10.130> to<00:07:10.550> 100<00:07:11.389> to

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 
price if it was priced closer to 100 to

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.200 
price if it was priced closer to 100 to
130<00:07:12.229> dollars<00:07:12.770> I'd<00:07:12.919> be<00:07:13.069> happy<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:13.580> recommend<00:07:13.759> it

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
130 dollars I'd be happy to recommend it

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.310 
130 dollars I'd be happy to recommend it
because<00:07:14.360> it<00:07:14.599> is<00:07:14.690> a<00:07:14.720> very<00:07:15.020> comfortable

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
because it is a very comfortable

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.029 
because it is a very comfortable
headphone<00:07:16.009> it<00:07:16.880> seems<00:07:17.419> decently<00:07:18.289> built<00:07:18.680> at<00:07:18.860> the

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 
headphone it seems decently built at the

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.730 
headphone it seems decently built at the
same<00:07:19.250> time<00:07:19.870> but<00:07:20.870> right<00:07:21.080> now<00:07:21.229> I<00:07:21.259> just<00:07:21.410> don't

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
same time but right now I just don't

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.589 
same time but right now I just don't
think<00:07:21.919> it's<00:07:22.130> a<00:07:22.280> good<00:07:22.550> buy<00:07:22.820> compared<00:07:23.300> to<00:07:23.419> other

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 
think it's a good buy compared to other

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.810 
think it's a good buy compared to other
options<00:07:24.080> like<00:07:24.229> the<00:07:24.380> sennheiser<00:07:24.620> amperior<00:07:24.919> um

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
options like the sennheiser amperior um

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.550 
options like the sennheiser amperior um
and<00:07:26.210> I'll<00:07:26.300> actually<00:07:26.570> be<00:07:26.870> reviewing<00:07:27.349> the

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 
and I'll actually be reviewing the

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.330 
and I'll actually be reviewing the
v-moda<00:07:28.160> XS<00:07:28.699> on<00:07:29.210> the<00:07:29.449> channel<00:07:29.870> soon<00:07:30.229> so<00:07:30.650> I

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
v-moda XS on the channel soon so I

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.580 
v-moda XS on the channel soon so I
suspect<00:07:31.820> that<00:07:32.210> this<00:07:32.509> headphone<00:07:32.900> won't

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
suspect that this headphone won't

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.180 
suspect that this headphone won't
compare<00:07:34.159> favorably<00:07:34.849> with<00:07:35.630> the<00:07:36.020> B<00:07:36.470> motor<00:07:36.710> XS

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
compare favorably with the B motor XS

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.480 
compare favorably with the B motor XS
either<00:07:37.550> but<00:07:38.389> um<00:07:38.599> you<00:07:39.259> know<00:07:39.349> I<00:07:39.380> don't<00:07:39.860> love<00:07:40.159> the
