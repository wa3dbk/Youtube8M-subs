probably gonna be like a ten ten
thousand<00:03:35.580> dollar<00:03:35.760> item<00:03:36.180> if<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.420> has<00:03:36.570> no

thousand dollar item if it has no
magical<00:03:37.260> properties<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.580> just<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
magical properties and it's just the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.940 
magical properties and it's just the
materials<00:03:39.510> made<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.080> would<00:03:40.500> say<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.770> ten

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
materials made of I would say it's ten

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.150 
materials made of I would say it's ten
thousand<00:03:41.340> gold<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.540> that's<00:03:42.630> all<00:03:42.959> crushed<00:03:43.380> you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
thousand gold and that's all crushed you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.400 
thousand gold and that's all crushed you
know<00:03:44.250> junk<00:03:44.640> sapphires<00:03:45.209> or<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.290> know

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
know junk sapphires or you know

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.290 
know junk sapphires or you know
basically<00:03:46.680> ten<00:03:47.100> thousand<00:03:47.459> gold<00:03:47.730> worth<00:03:48.060> of

basically ten thousand gold worth of
crushed<00:03:48.870> sapphire<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:49.920> have<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
crushed sapphire and then you have to

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.010 
crushed sapphire and then you have to
find<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.459> major<00:03:50.640> once<00:03:50.910> guys<00:03:51.060> fabricate<00:03:51.750> on<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
find a major once guys fabricate on it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.590 
find a major once guys fabricate on it
so<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.260> fits<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.530> properly<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.820> basically<00:03:54.480> a

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
so it fits you properly so basically a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.060 
so it fits you properly so basically a
custom-made<00:03:55.170> cuz<00:03:55.440> you're<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.650> bending<00:03:55.860> that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
custom-made cuz you're not bending that

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.280 
custom-made cuz you're not bending that
stuff<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.030> custom-made<00:03:57.480> fabricated

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
stuff so like a custom-made fabricated

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.110 
stuff so like a custom-made fabricated
piece<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.770> fit<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.130> that's<00:03:59.459> what<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.670> would<00:03:59.880> say

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
piece to fit you that's what I would say

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.290 
piece to fit you that's what I would say
and<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.840> would<00:04:00.870> say<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.260> 10<00:04:01.470> 10<00:04:01.860> grand<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.520> a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
and I would say like 10 10 grand is a

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.760 
and I would say like 10 10 grand is a
reasonable<00:04:03.840> price<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.200> mean<00:04:04.350> within<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
reasonable price I mean within the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.220 
reasonable price I mean within the
parameters<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.310> D&amp;D<00:04:06.180> itself<00:04:06.630> there's<00:04:06.840> tons<00:04:07.110> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
parameters of D&amp;D itself there's tons of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.570 
parameters of D&amp;D itself there's tons of
ways<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.500> do<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.740> I<00:04:07.860> mean<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.220> used<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> be

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
ways to do this I mean there used to be

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.310 
ways to do this I mean there used to be
a<00:04:08.700> spell<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.240> I<00:04:09.300> think<00:04:09.510> he<00:04:09.600> even<00:04:09.690> mentions<00:04:10.170> it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
a spell and I think he even mentions it

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.530 
a spell and I think he even mentions it
and<00:04:10.489> previous<00:04:11.489> editions<00:04:11.880> called<00:04:12.060> glass<00:04:12.270> steel

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
and previous editions called glass steel

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.620 
and previous editions called glass steel
which<00:04:12.720> would<00:04:12.840> basically<00:04:13.020> do<00:04:13.470> what<00:04:13.590> he<00:04:13.709> wants

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
which would basically do what he wants

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.030 
which would basically do what he wants
it<00:04:15.630> was<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> high<00:04:15.989> level<00:04:16.200> spa<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.859> it's

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
it was a high level spa so it's

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.920 
it was a high level spa so it's
essentially<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> same<00:04:18.600> thing<00:04:18.780> with<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
essentially you do the same thing with a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.440 
essentially you do the same thing with a
wish<00:04:19.169> spa<00:04:19.410> but<00:04:20.220> again<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.730> need<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.000> find<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
wish spa but again you need to find a

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.480 
wish spa but again you need to find a
mage<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:21.870> gonna<00:04:22.020> cast<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.650> knife<00:04:22.890> level<00:04:23.220> wish

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490

mage it's gonna cast a knife level wish
spell<00:04:23.790> for<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.240> or<00:04:24.810> find<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.290> wish<00:04:25.440> spell

or whatever now if fabricates
fourth-level<00:04:28.610> by<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:28.970> way<00:04:29.180> yeah

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
fourth-level by the way yeah

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.710

blazes<00:07:08.290> and<00:07:09.290> on<00:07:09.530> the<00:07:09.620> cheap<00:07:09.860> side<00:07:10.100> you<00:07:10.280> could

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
blazes and on the cheap side you could

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.190 
blazes and on the cheap side you could
probably<00:07:10.669> say<00:07:11.120> rather<00:07:11.300> than<00:07:11.419> have<00:07:11.780> etched

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
probably say rather than have etched

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.560 
probably say rather than have etched
full<00:07:13.070> plate<00:07:13.310> or<00:07:13.460> whether<00:07:13.639> you<00:07:14.000> could<00:07:14.150> have<00:07:14.389> it

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
full plate or whether you could have it

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.620 
full plate or whether you could have it
be<00:07:14.780> an<00:07:15.410> a<00:07:15.530> mold<00:07:15.800> instead<00:07:16.220> so<00:07:17.150> it<00:07:17.270> looks<00:07:17.510> like

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
be an a mold instead so it looks like

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.360 
be an a mold instead so it looks like
it's<00:07:17.870> glass<00:07:18.139> and<00:07:18.560> we<00:07:18.680> could<00:07:18.830> also<00:07:18.950> have<00:07:19.100> that

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
it's glass and we could also have that

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.450 
it's glass and we could also have that
like<00:07:19.580> high<00:07:19.760> polish<00:07:20.240> and<00:07:20.510> then<00:07:20.889> put<00:07:21.889> an<00:07:22.130> animal
