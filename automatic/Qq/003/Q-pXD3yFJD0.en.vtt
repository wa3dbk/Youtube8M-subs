our<00:01:50.740> age<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:51.820> feel<00:01:52.060> even<00:01:52.270> given<00:01:52.929> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
our age and I feel even given the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.169 
our age and I feel even given the
economy<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:54.039> elected<00:01:54.369> officials<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:55.030> do

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
economy the elected officials can do

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.149 
economy the elected officials can do
only<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:55.539> much<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.350> feel<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:57.009> they<00:01:57.130> should

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
only so much I feel that they should

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.209 
only so much I feel that they should
basically<00:01:57.609> look<00:01:58.390> elsewhere<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:59.229> under<00:02:00.039> that

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
basically look elsewhere for under that

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.179 
basically look elsewhere for under that
retirement<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.569> education<00:02:02.439> because<00:02:02.859> in<00:02:03.069> the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
retirement and education because in the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.520 
retirement and education because in the
end<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:04.000> need<00:02:04.179> people<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:05.049> go<00:02:05.170> into<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
end you need people to go into the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.380 
end you need people to go into the
teaching<00:02:05.740> profession<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.610> stay<00:02:06.909> there<00:02:07.179> I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
teaching profession and stay there I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.900 
teaching profession and stay there I
think<00:02:08.319> elected<00:02:08.799> officials<00:02:09.280> need<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.580> be<00:02:09.700> made

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
think elected officials need to be made

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.059 
think elected officials need to be made
aware<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> consistent<00:02:10.780> basis<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
aware on a consistent basis that you

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.039 
aware on a consistent basis that you
don't<00:02:12.250> mess<00:02:12.549> with<00:02:12.580> certain<00:02:13.180> things<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.900> me

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
don't mess with certain things to me

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.220 
don't mess with certain things to me
this<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:14.650> important<00:02:15.250> as<00:02:15.660> leaving<00:02:16.660> veterans

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
this is as important as leaving veterans

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.930 
this is as important as leaving veterans
benefits<00:02:17.739> alone<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.190> I'm<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.489> veteran<00:02:18.910> but

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
benefits alone and I'm not a veteran but

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640 
benefits alone and I'm not a veteran but
there<00:02:19.180> are<00:02:19.269> certain<00:02:19.599> things<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:20.140> should<00:02:20.620> be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
there are certain things that should be

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.949 
there are certain things that should be
sacrosanct<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.640> said<00:02:22.480> we're<00:02:22.630> an<00:02:22.690> easy<00:02:22.780> target

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
sacrosanct I said we're an easy target

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.690 
sacrosanct I said we're an easy target
and<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.590> think<00:02:23.799> teachers<00:02:24.040> need<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.549> more

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and I think teachers need to be more

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.539 
and I think teachers need to be more
militant<00:02:25.329> on<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.630> professional<00:02:26.260> adult<00:02:27.220> level

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
militant on a professional adult level

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.729 
militant on a professional adult level
and<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:28.630> about<00:02:28.810> screaming<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.500> TV

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and it's not just about screaming on TV

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.670 
and it's not just about screaming on TV
I<00:02:30.190> think<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.239> needs<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.599> consistent<00:02:32.230> effort

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
I think it needs to be consistent effort

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.240 
I think it needs to be consistent effort
and<00:02:32.860> people<00:02:33.579> need<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> consciousness

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and people need to have a consciousness

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.160 
and people need to have a consciousness
awakened<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.540> people<00:02:37.540> need<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.900> more<00:02:38.110> of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
awakened and people need to have more of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.440 
awakened and people need to have more of
an<00:02:38.319> awareness<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.459> believe<00:02:39.760> strongly<00:02:40.090> in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
an awareness and I believe strongly in

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180 
an awareness and I believe strongly in
the<00:02:40.629> fact<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.959> teachers<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.769> change

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the fact that teachers can be change

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.850 
the fact that teachers can be change
agents<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:43.180> only<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:43.720> what<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:44.019> see<00:02:44.079> but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
agents not only for what they see but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.100 
agents not only for what they see but
also<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.310> what<00:02:45.459> pertains<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:46.180> them<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.629> think

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
also for what pertains to them I think

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.690 
also for what pertains to them I think
you<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.560> consistent<00:02:47.860> with<00:02:48.370> it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
you have to be consistent with it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.640 
you have to be consistent with it
because<00:02:49.090> otherwise<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.019> situation<00:02:50.620> just

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
because otherwise the situation just

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.830 
because otherwise the situation just
keeps<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:52.090> wind<00:02:52.269> up<00:02:52.390> having<00:02:52.599> a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
keeps going and you wind up having a

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.250 
keeps going and you wind up having a
really<00:02:53.110> hard<00:02:53.230> retirement<00:02:54.069> life
