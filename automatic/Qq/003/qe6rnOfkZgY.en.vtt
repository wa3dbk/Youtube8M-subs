00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
if that makes any sense on camera I
don't<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.230> does<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.920> sexual<00:00:41.460> color

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

the color is not as pink in person it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.470 
the color is not as pink in person it's
more<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> purpley<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> maybe<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.090> swatch

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
more of a purpley but maybe if I swatch

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.430 
more of a purpley but maybe if I swatch
it<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.110> guys<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.590> tell<00:00:49.829> okay<00:00:50.789> no<00:00:51.660> even

swatching<00:00:52.920> doesn't<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> justice<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
swatching doesn't do it justice but it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
swatching doesn't do it justice but it's

it on the street but yeah so I chose

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
it on the street but yeah so I chose
this<00:01:18.720> color<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.009> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this color and I do think that this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
this color and I do think that this
color<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.270> wearable<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.380> only<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
color is wearable it's not only for

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
color is wearable it's not only for
winter<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> fall<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> darker

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
winter and fall time like it's a darker

winter and fall time like it's a darker
color<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> work

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
color but I think you can make it work
even<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> springtime<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> summer

moisturize<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.770> lips<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.960> apparently<00:01:57.960> it's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
moisturize your lips and apparently it's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499

creamy<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:58.979> try<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> let's<00:02:00.390> see

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
creamy so let's try it out and let's see

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
creamy so let's try it out and let's see
if<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> actually<00:02:00.869> less

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:19.000 

you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.270 

i<00:02:19.040> justified<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.330> actually<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.560> really

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
i justified it and actually I really

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.470 
i justified it and actually I really
really<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.120> color

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
really like the color

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.809 
really like the color
I<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.290> pigmented<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.400> goes<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:25.790> really

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
I think it's pigmented it goes on really

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.580 
I think it's pigmented it goes on really
smoothly<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.780> doesn't<00:02:27.140> feel<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.380> it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
smoothly it doesn't feel like it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.170 
smoothly it doesn't feel like it's
drying<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:28.069> your<00:02:28.099> lips<00:02:28.370> which<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.700> really<00:02:28.970> good

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
drying on your lips which is really good

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.390 
drying on your lips which is really good
but<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.020> kind<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> doubt<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.250> it's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
but I kind of have a doubt that it's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.760 
but I kind of have a doubt that it's
gonna<00:02:31.520> last<00:02:31.819> all<00:02:32.060> day<00:02:32.239> because<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.380> don't<00:02:33.680> know

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
gonna last all day because I don't know

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.020 
gonna last all day because I don't know
I<00:02:33.800> feel<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.069> when<00:02:34.340> things<00:02:34.520> don't<00:02:34.819> feel

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
I feel like when things don't feel

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.470 
I feel like when things don't feel
drying<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.780> my<00:02:35.810> lips<00:02:36.250> they're<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:38.120> going<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
drying on my lips they're not going to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.860 
drying on my lips they're not going to
last

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
last

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.570 
last
um<00:02:38.959> but<00:02:39.319> yeah<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> color<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
um but yeah I really like the color I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.460 
um but yeah I really like the color I
think<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.000> color<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.330> totally<00:02:41.720> wearable<00:02:42.319> for

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
think this color is totally wearable for

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.140 
think this color is totally wearable for
the<00:02:42.590> summer<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.310> kind<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.730> reminds<00:02:44.450> me<00:02:44.510> of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the summer it kind of reminds me of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.080

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.800 
exactly what happened it's not smooth
and<00:04:14.430> creamy<00:04:14.610> anymore<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.510> was<00:04:15.630> when<00:04:15.780> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
and creamy anymore like it was when I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.690

first<00:04:16.049> applied<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.470> now<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:16.950> really<00:04:17.220> sticky

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
first applied it now it's really sticky

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.930 
first applied it now it's really sticky
and<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.570> absolutely<00:04:18.919> hate<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.489> lipstick

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
and I absolutely hate that in a lipstick

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.930 
and I absolutely hate that in a lipstick
so<00:04:21.690> that's<00:04:22.530> my<00:04:22.710> only<00:04:22.890> problem<00:04:23.100> with<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.669> I'm

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.920

lipstick will stay on while I'm eating
and<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.250> doesn't<00:04:35.850> transfer<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.540> done<00:04:37.200> this

hours

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
hours

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.170 
hours
and<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.419> says<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.720> less<00:04:42.870> ten<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:44.310> five<00:04:44.760> more<00:04:45.060> to

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
and it says it less ten so five more to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.960 
and it says it less ten so five more to
go<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.630> I'll<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.950> back<00:04:47.130> for<00:04:47.340> an<00:04:47.460> update<00:04:47.760> I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
go and I'll be back for an update I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.969 
go and I'll be back for an update I
guess<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.479> about<00:04:48.690> five<00:04:48.930> hours<00:04:48.960> I'm<00:04:49.620> back<00:04:49.830> for

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
guess in about five hours I'm back for

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.850 
guess in about five hours I'm back for
my<00:04:50.040> final<00:04:50.520> update<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:51.270> been<00:04:51.540> about<00:04:51.860> eight

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
my final update it's been about eight

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.150 
my final update it's been about eight
and<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> half<00:04:53.130> hours<00:04:53.550> it's<00:04:54.440> 9:05<00:04:55.440> p.m.<00:04:55.680> right

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
and a half hours it's 9:05 p.m. right

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.690 
and a half hours it's 9:05 p.m. right
now<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:57.740> figured<00:04:58.740> what's<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.310> difference

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
now so I figured what's the difference

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.820 
now so I figured what's the difference
like<00:05:00.000> an<00:05:00.810> hour<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.169> a<00:05:01.200> half's<00:05:01.380> not<00:05:01.650> going<00:05:01.770> to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
like an hour and a half's not going to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.500 
like an hour and a half's not going to
make<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:01.979> big<00:05:02.190> difference<00:05:02.310> considering<00:05:03.180> the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
make a big difference considering the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.650 
make a big difference considering the
lipsticks<00:05:03.960> still<00:05:04.169> stayed<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.660> obviously

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
lipsticks still stayed on and obviously

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.420 
lipsticks still stayed on and obviously
it's<00:05:07.110> probably<00:05:07.470> going<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.860> stay<00:05:08.070> on<00:05:08.100> if<00:05:08.340> I

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
it's probably going to stay on if I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.870 
it's probably going to stay on if I
don't<00:05:08.580> eat<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:08.880> don't<00:05:09.690> do<00:05:09.900> anything<00:05:10.140> else<00:05:10.430> um<00:05:11.430> so

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
don't eat I don't do anything else um so

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.490 
don't eat I don't do anything else um so
the<00:05:11.940> lipstick<00:05:12.270> did<00:05:12.450> last<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.960> eat<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.410> it

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
the lipstick did last I eat and it
