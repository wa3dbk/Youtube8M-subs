00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.290
 much or too little is what gets rid of it 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 want action too much fat if you have one 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.890
 Chris Channel has achieved what is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.829
 tax law higher exactly that is more 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.559
 fighting for your organs and day 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 is too high then you really see it whole 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.850
 very risk and area and then you really have to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 Get on with your horrible act once 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 the more fat found to be organs 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.359
 of course everything comes a bit in one 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 hr is in the printing and it is fine 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.770
 for being that is not good for you and go 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 really ailments come through her and quite 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
 hard to solve so i want you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 briefly show a scan that is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 makes your back too which is made of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.610
 a person is not a half channel 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 has fat content like this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.700
 I show it I do n't know if it's one 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700
 little can see well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.290
 but here you see a normal person one 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 woman weighs 26 in 54 pounds and that one 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.060
 whole 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.280
 65 and with view of 20 and then see 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.140
 that you are just a bit divided 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.439
 will put the body away for us 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 Of course some Venlo way 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.500
 vitamins and minerals 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.880
 so got up to hold him 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 think it's leaning anyway 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 so this first nice picture is quite 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.050
 decently 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 only in the second direction road to one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.630
 response kilo and that is a bit 68 and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.290
 the opinion is 40 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.420
 baby us the 2025 sentences so like mine 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.820
 opinion of you know that there is far 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.530
 above filtro size 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.990
 and you can also see you should see here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.240
 the all spots around the organs and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.480
 you even see it fresh in the brain 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.670
 and that of course is us and dangers for 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.770
 I hope I immediately video the media 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.610
 can tell what fat content is 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.410
 madness and why is so often and yes me 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.230
 will say for yourself check your own 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.780
 legs do not own fat content equally 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.060
 and yes I hope it is for you anyway 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.720
 were allowed as soon as you go after a real one 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.740
 mega-mega is not a high fat percentage 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.660
 very good 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.480
 thank you therefore doing is actually from it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.820
 convert fat into muscle mass 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.670
 Name indicates converting into muscle mass is possible 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.070
 Tell if you suppose you have the pounds of fat 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.050
 it looks like this and if you have a mouse 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.790
 are going to convert into muscles 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.810
 then it looks like the muscles are 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.820
 also less big if you don't 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.880
 so much off and a lot of color 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.400
 but which are standing in centimeters 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.600
 the centimeters are often more important as 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.910
 the kilos 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.940
 so you are going to convert your fat into muscles 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.250
 how to do that exactly by going full 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.890
 play sports and can take lives because 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.010
 every but namely your muscles bigger 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.660
 and more so far than is being converted to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.950
 muscle mass and more muscle mass you get 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.980
 become pregnant in your center 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.800
 therefore burn more calories 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.810
 with if you're too high fat 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.700
 go make sure you have more muscles 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.180
 makes a fight is going to put in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180
 muscle mass
