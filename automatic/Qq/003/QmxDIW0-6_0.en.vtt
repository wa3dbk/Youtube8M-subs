your core muscles focus and keeping the

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.210 
your core muscles focus and keeping the
balance<00:07:05.900> you<00:07:06.139> know<00:07:06.320> it's<00:07:06.620> a<00:07:06.680> very<00:07:06.919> challenging

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
balance you know it's a very challenging

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.640 
balance you know it's a very challenging
exercise<00:07:07.970> but<00:07:08.120> you<00:07:08.240> can<00:07:08.270> do<00:07:08.600> it<00:07:08.660> and<00:07:08.960> we're

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
exercise but you can do it and we're

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.850 
exercise but you can do it and we're
doing<00:07:10.130> 10<00:07:10.699> reps<00:07:11.030> on<00:07:11.270> each<00:07:11.600> leg<00:07:11.660> so<00:07:12.289> you<00:07:12.350> do<00:07:12.590> 10

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
doing 10 reps on each leg so you do 10

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.840 
doing 10 reps on each leg so you do 10
reps<00:07:13.130> and<00:07:13.940> you<00:07:14.060> switch<00:07:14.360> legs<00:07:14.949> and<00:07:15.949> you<00:07:16.160> do<00:07:16.340> 10

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
reps and you switch legs and you do 10

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.180 
reps and you switch legs and you do 10
reps<00:07:17.150> on<00:07:17.900> the<00:07:18.229> other<00:07:18.350> side<00:07:20.169> and<00:07:21.169> that's<00:07:21.770> it

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
reps on the other side and that's it

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.890 
reps on the other side and that's it
so<00:07:22.539> that's<00:07:23.539> it<00:07:23.960> that's<00:07:24.229> one<00:07:24.590> round<00:07:24.860> and<00:07:25.900> this

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
so that's it that's one round and this

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.010 
so that's it that's one round and this
is<00:07:27.080> a<00:07:27.110> 15-minute<00:07:27.979> MRAP<00:07:28.699> which<00:07:29.419> means<00:07:29.750> that<00:07:29.930> you

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
is a 15-minute MRAP which means that you

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.439 
is a 15-minute MRAP which means that you
cannot<00:07:30.229> set<00:07:30.440> up<00:07:30.530> your<00:07:30.680> timer<00:07:31.010> for<00:07:31.340> 15<00:07:31.760> minutes

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.449 
cannot set up your timer for 15 minutes

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.610 
cannot set up your timer for 15 minutes
and<00:07:32.840> your<00:07:33.500> goal<00:07:33.800> is<00:07:34.100> to<00:07:34.789> do<00:07:35.510> as<00:07:35.690> many<00:07:36.139> rounds<00:07:36.350> as

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620 
and your goal is to do as many rounds as

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.800 
and your goal is to do as many rounds as

possible as many total reps as possible

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.870 
possible as many total reps as possible
so<00:07:42.080> I'll<00:07:42.800> give<00:07:42.979> you<00:07:43.010> an<00:07:43.130> example<00:07:43.430> if<00:07:43.669> you
