hey<00:00:00.870> guys<00:00:01.020> sunny<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.530> with<00:00:01.650> Monica<00:00:02.040> blog<00:00:02.220> and

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey guys sunny here with Monica blog and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.370 
hey guys sunny here with Monica blog and
we<00:00:02.760> have<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> hardware<00:00:03.629> comparison<00:00:04.230> between

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
we have a hardware comparison between

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.550 
we have a hardware comparison between
the<00:00:05.180> HTC<00:00:06.180> One<00:00:06.450> which<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.870> HTC<00:00:07.350> s<00:00:07.410> latest

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
the HTC One which is HTC s latest

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.129 
the HTC One which is HTC s latest
flagship<00:00:08.069> running<00:00:08.400> Android<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
flagship running Android and we have the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.200 
flagship running Android and we have the
course<00:00:10.559> Lumia<00:00:10.889> 920<00:00:11.309> running<00:00:11.730> Windows<00:00:11.940> Phone<00:00:12.090> 8

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
course Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.539 
course Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8
so<00:00:12.750> basically<00:00:13.320> both<00:00:13.500> these<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.920> pretty<00:00:14.400> much

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so basically both these are pretty much

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
so basically both these are pretty much
equal<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.059> size<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.690> HTC<00:00:16.230> One<00:00:16.440> has<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.980> larger

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
equal in size the HTC One has a larger

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
equal in size the HTC One has a larger
screen<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:17.609> 4.7<00:00:18.210> inches<00:00:18.480> compared<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> 4.5

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
screen at 4.7 inches compared to the 4.5

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.390 
screen at 4.7 inches compared to the 4.5
of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.539> 920<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.289> actual<00:00:22.680> dimensions<00:00:23.189> they

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
of the 920 but in actual dimensions they

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
of the 920 but in actual dimensions they
are<00:00:23.550> pretty<00:00:24.029> much<00:00:24.210> close<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> each<00:00:24.660> other<00:00:24.840> as

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
are pretty much close to each other as

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.150 
are pretty much close to each other as
you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.260> there<00:00:25.439> isn't<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> size

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you can see there isn't much of a size

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.599 
you can see there isn't much of a size
difference<00:00:26.310> between<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> quick

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
difference between two so just a quick

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.179 
difference between two so just a quick
rundown<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> specs<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.619> 720<00:00:31.619> hat<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
rundown of the specs the 720 hat of the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.510 
rundown of the specs the 720 hat of the
920<00:00:32.550> has<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> 720p<00:00:33.300> screen<00:00:33.360> while<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.309> HTC<00:00:35.309> One

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
920 has a 720p screen while the HTC One

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
920 has a 720p screen while the HTC One
has<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:36.059> 1080<00:00:36.600> screen<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.860> how<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
has a 1080 screen I don't know how to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.639 
has a 1080 screen I don't know how to
turn<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.989> although<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.320> hit<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
turn it on really although I hit that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.090 
turn it on really although I hit that
button<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.920> there

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
button right there

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.240 
button right there
yeah<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> 1080p<00:00:42.420> screen<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:43.260> 4.7<00:00:44.070> inches

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
yeah that's a 1080p screen at 4.7 inches

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.520 
yeah that's a 1080p screen at 4.7 inches
and<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:45.239> said<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> 920<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.910> 720p<00:00:47.910> screen<00:00:48.059> at

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
and we said the 920 has a 720p screen at

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.310 
and we said the 920 has a 720p screen at
4.5<00:00:49.530> inches<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.329> course<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
4.5 inches and of course you have the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.130 
4.5 inches and of course you have the
obvious<00:00:52.559> differences<00:00:53.070> between<00:00:53.899> Android<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
obvious differences between Android and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
obvious differences between Android and
Windows<00:00:55.469> Phone<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.370> mainly<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
Windows Phone but this is mainly a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.619 
Windows Phone but this is mainly a
hardware<00:00:57.989> comparison<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> as<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.510> see

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
hardware comparison so as you can see

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.290 
hardware comparison so as you can see
there<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> difference<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.640> thickness<00:01:02.969> size

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
there is a difference in thickness size

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.340 
there is a difference in thickness size
the<00:01:03.539> 920<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> obviously<00:01:04.559> thicker<00:01:04.880> but

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
the 920 is obviously thicker but

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
the 920 is obviously thicker but
generally<00:01:07.909> they<00:01:08.909> both<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> sort<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
generally they both have like a sort of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
generally they both have like a sort of
curved<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.740> fits<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
curved back which fits quite well in the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
curved back which fits quite well in the
palm<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.659> hand<00:01:12.780> making<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> feel<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> lot

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
palm of your hand making it feel a lot

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.160 
palm of your hand making it feel a lot
smoother<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> nicer<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.030> grip

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
smoother and nicer to grip

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
smoother and nicer to grip
on<00:01:17.010> two<00:01:17.250> cameras<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.120> both<00:01:18.300> have<00:01:18.479> obviously

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
on two cameras they both have obviously

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
on two cameras they both have obviously
rear-facing<00:01:19.140> cameras<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> capture<00:01:20.280> video

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
rear-facing cameras that capture video

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.110 
rear-facing cameras that capture video
in<00:01:20.580> 1080p<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.810> HTC<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:23.070> uses<00:01:23.550> their<00:01:23.760> ultra

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
in 1080p the HTC one uses their ultra

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.240 
in 1080p the HTC one uses their ultra
pixel<00:01:24.270> camera<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.960> takes<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
pixel camera which takes with the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
pixel camera which takes with the
temperature<00:01:26.760> of<00:01:27.000> 2.0<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.840> takes<00:01:28.020> better

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.710 

it<00:01:31.350> takes<00:01:31.560> better<00:01:31.680> videos<00:01:32.360> better<00:01:33.360> pictures

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it takes better videos better pictures

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.320 
it takes better videos better pictures
in<00:01:33.840> low<00:01:33.930> light<00:01:34.170> while<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> 920<00:01:35.400> uses<00:01:35.700> its<00:01:35.850> OS

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
in low light while the 920 uses its OS

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.440 
in low light while the 920 uses its OS
or<00:01:36.479> optical<00:01:36.750> image<00:01:36.930> stabilization<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:38.070> take

or optical image stabilization to take

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
or optical image stabilization to take
better<00:01:39.450> pictures<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.080> night<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
better pictures as well as night and on

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
better pictures as well as night and on
the<00:01:41.220> front-facing<00:01:41.670> camera<00:01:42.060> side<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the front-facing camera side you have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.499 
the front-facing camera side you have
the<00:01:42.900> HTC<00:01:43.830> One<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> 1080p<00:01:44.610> 2.1<00:01:45.360> megapixel

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the HTC One with a 1080p 2.1 megapixel

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.840 
the HTC One with a 1080p 2.1 megapixel
camera<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.159> 920<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.420> front-facing

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
camera and the 920 has a front-facing

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.010 
camera and the 920 has a front-facing
1.3<00:01:50.850> megapixel<00:01:50.940> camera<00:01:51.509> i<00:01:51.570> believe<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> takes

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
1.3 megapixel camera i believe it takes

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.490 
1.3 megapixel camera i believe it takes
HD<00:01:52.649> videos<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.340> 720p<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> that's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
HD videos as well in 720p so that's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.870 
HD videos as well in 720p so that's
pretty<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:56.040> much<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> rundown<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pretty pretty much it for the rundown of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.859 
pretty pretty much it for the rundown of
the<00:01:57.030> specs<00:01:57.270> i<00:01:57.420> mean<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> can't<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the specs i mean you can't really

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
the specs i mean you can't really
compare<00:01:58.290> internals<00:01:59.280> since<00:01:59.490> each<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
compare internals since each one is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
compare internals since each one is
running<00:02:00.030> its<00:02:00.180> own<00:02:00.299> operating<00:02:00.659> system<00:02:00.920> but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
running its own operating system but

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380 
running its own operating system but
that's<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> keep<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.000> guys<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> loop

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that's just to keep you guys in the loop

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.200 
that's just to keep you guys in the loop
