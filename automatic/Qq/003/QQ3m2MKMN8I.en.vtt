00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.779
 hey people done now and that is now 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.580
 I believe the seventh eighth twentieth 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.529
 try to make this video 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 actually i wanted the video over the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.970
 make patch or 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.620
 what he had changed now but me 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.830
 I'm not at the moment to clear 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.770
 I have simply no bock one now 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.640
 from the horse to talk yes the final rate 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.260
 the brand from 180 to 160 rpm I have 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.660
 just at the moment just at all 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.020
 do not mind why I'm grad 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.630
 rage mode turned on without shit because 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.750
 if you just think about it then 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.890
 is the patch politics or the politics 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.399
 from dice just totally for the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.489
 But that's just a thesis and 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.759
 ready to explain why now 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.920
 I just so easily because it brings 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.539
 every three months petrausch probably 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.030
 always with the next addon 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.119
 So then the next one with that is it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.479
 aftermath or just that 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.510
 complete game feeling in the ground and 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.780
 ground completely shakes any 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.880
 includes stupid mistakes and one 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.229
 fuck at all with this game 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.790
 provides but that one only once again 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.229
 I did not have to learn that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.659
 I buy a new game when I buy 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.220
 wants to learn a new game and wait 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.549
 Not until that was a patch out again 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.100
 I did not like it that way 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.280
 The community is actually little 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.650
 questioned and then only if that thing 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.960
 anyone around here today at 16 it too 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have to put our nerves away 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.890
 it can not be that for now 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.170
 example here was only annoyed 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.729
 or tanks have been nurtured just because 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.350
 people do not mind not arriving 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.360
 Proper walkways do not know how 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.100
 one proceeds against it or if tank around 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960
 the corner comes which runs I run 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.540
 must to avoid the without shit 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.590
 can not be the same had 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.620
 we with depression 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.320
 the same has only been had with m 26 did 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.340
 the march pettstÃ¤dt action completely 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.890
 has broken 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.750
 yes these are just the most blatant examples 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.739
 and this patch brings in part so 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.410
 checkout negative things with them that the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.720
 better things 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.230
 Of course they are always there 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:36.770
 no longer be the main thing and that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:38.090
 That's the bad thing, but why me 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.890
 not only wants to flame but 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.660
 also a bit of constructive criticism 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.390
 attach or make a suggestion 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.690
 and my suggestion are beta patch 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.170
 server so what does that mean simply 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.270
 beta patch servers are the only servers 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.040
 to be put on by dice 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
 can play the the latest version 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 of the patch 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.770
 that means there will be the gameplay 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.110
 changing elements from the next patch 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.400
 played and simply tested and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.680
 then a feedback will be given 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.740
 maybe you should just as well 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 to invite a certain amount of players 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.650
 that you do not already have such a thing 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.420
 fresh of the straight from cod 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.460
 has come over and has no idea 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.950
 from the whole game on the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.650
 server leaves like this and this server has 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.600
 then just now access the configuration 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.830
 but in the next patch, we come so 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.330
 as far as it is at the moment of dice 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 was developed and then becomes one 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.490
 given feedback and so would be something like 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.420
 they tear something wm 26 state that would be 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.850
 Everything never happened Yes I think so 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260
 Now the worst thing about this patch is me 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.660
 can not really help me between heli 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.370
 and armor decide 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.040
 without shit the canister ammunition the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 Panzer was so annoyed that is 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 i can not do it anymore the main cannons 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.560
 fire couple change and break the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.330
 canister firing ammunition 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.230
 No, I have to do that now 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.700
 Pretty coke laid out coaxial 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.130
 against infantry with my armor 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.350
 just because nobody is against 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.340
 to act knows that is feasible 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.500
 you just have to be a little bit 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.320
 Smarter, worse 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.220
 Actually, but the heli I think 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.280
 it is a good choice 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.410
 oettinger and ignaz for weapons but the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.299
 heli so annoying that the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.580
 Ghanaians no countermeasures he has 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.550
 is completely exaggerated are absolute 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.020
 nonsense but we often see that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.000
 there is somehow doing everything 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.290
 really bad and eventually it will 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.130
 patched up again a bit high 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.880
 so that it is okay 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.930
 but I do not feel like the whole game 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.699
 two years to play 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.509
 or almost two years to play it 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.550
 in quotes is done so until 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.380
 the time has come that it does not stop anymore 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.720
 All three are completely changed 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.850
 months it has to learn new game 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.530
 Of course it is clear that there is also 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.389
 his own imagination like the game 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.430
 should be realized and not 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.979
 just to listen to me, for example 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.900
 I think it would be a great choice, but would 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.550
 Just turtle tube like that 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.860
 consultancy team 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.750
 for upcoming patches and patch is not 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.240
 to deliver more every three months but 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.930
 maybe once a month at least 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.389
 and in such cases as m 26 data acute 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.669
 to deliver patch immediately because that is 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.789
 makes absolutely the game feeling broken 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.320
 and this game wants to stand there is yes 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.970
 in itself necessarily 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.130
 so I hope I do not have you 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.229
 too paralyzed in this video but me 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.389
 think that some points of it relative 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.449
 are important and sometimes addressed 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.130
 belong mainly because I do not feel like it 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.380
 had such a video we produce now 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.510
 actually only what is said what will 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.610
 changed what it is that is quite good that 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.199
 it's not so good 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.010
 whoever wants to hear that anyway, I give 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.020
 maybe a short one too 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.760
 Summary 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.800
 I find most weapons changes 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.659
 in order 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.070
 a few are but shit rex to 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.419
 example is now too strong 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.460
 just a panic weapon because you too 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.159
 shoots fast 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.840
 magnum has changed though a few 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.400
 in fact not at all from the gameplay 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.259
 I changed the whole thing before 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.070
 final rate could not at all 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.190
 exploit 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.349
 that means now slower shoots 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.919
 or shoot slower can even change 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.979
 not as much 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.320
 so I wish that the 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.680
 time lesser recharge time 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.949
 but she also has everything about it 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.409
 cosmetically as well as f2000 and all 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.300
 94 has not changed in fact 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.790
 why do you then do the zero one 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.420
 almost ever 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.150
 up or down this is a 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.070
 bit silly I think so pioneers 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.720
 mph 1 was annoyed as well the n16 a3 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.880
 you can do that by the way for 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.190
 the 16 03 11 16 is a good one 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.530
 alternative but not the top weapon 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.680
 like all again my worth back from 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:56.380
 The chilled for 16 it must fully the places 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:07:03.120
 be weapon you're just shit on 16 03 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:06.070
 14 416 video follows at 4 1 against the 36 c 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.240
 I think is also a theme which one times 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.640
 can cut and write if you like 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.990
 that would have been what was still remembered 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.460
 yes things and noble and armor and helix 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.460
 I had already over it 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.740
 just chat please write everything 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.630
 let's see what you think about it 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.480
 only from the individual changes now 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.430
 but from dice patch politics why it 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.540
 Actually, in this video ag and looks 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.860
 including which videos he in 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.600
 So next time you want to see 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.100
 For example, the offer was a 16 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.990
 416 I hope it was fun though 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.380
 I'll go down until next time 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.380
 ciao
