00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.200
 the Antarctic vessel steal pisa and vanguard was built in the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.949
 shipyards in the city of gdansk poland and went on loan later 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:42.010
 service of democratic Germany in 1976 when the two germany united 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.180
 it happened to belong to the force of sea of ​​the Uruguayan naval base in 1991 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 the acquired vessel possesses submarine rescue capabilities supporting divers 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.560
 also supported in case of fires at sea biological nuclear cleanup and 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.380
 chemistry thanks to its ability to navigate in and on or from its 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.990
 incorporation has developed every year Antarctic naval missions in 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.960
 support for the scientific base artigas the captain of frigate commander 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 guerrilla against spoke to us of the avant-garde 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 with the specific mission of the guard 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.870
 good at this stage that we are about to face now next Friday 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.869
 in the morning we are acting for blind supplies 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.630
 so that in 2002 the operation of the Antarctic scientific base 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.270
 that is, that the vanguard makes these trips annually to be a continent 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.740
 yes yes exactly approximately the same date so all the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.549
 provisions and some elements 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.030
 of structure to improve a bit the structure of the base 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 and that during the month of January and that is part of February we will be in 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.310
 Disagreement Regarding Morumbi Accept Antarctica 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.619
 we do not have rigid dates, we are a bit dependent on the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.960
 weather conditions 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.270
 but approximately percent about 35 days about 35 days past due and the trip 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.680
 stand up and turn around 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.990
 scales 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.300
 in Ushuaia and Puntarenas regarding the Alvaro provision 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.069
 clarified the issue got what one can be an impediment to not get in 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.289
 time and form 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:21.409
 we do not have time and form and neither is it an impediment that we simply seek 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.879
 the most appropriate conditions because as we go with load the effects of 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.709
 fire 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.779
 it does not happen very well recaredo proclaimed himself boss 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.919
 surf 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.039
 with good condition especially in the crossing of the right is an area 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.319
 known for everything 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.849
 of storms 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.510
 in dangerous waters then 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.399
 we look for the best mix 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.980
 meteorology for all 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.709
 since he has arrived he sails the seas of the guard 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.620
 the guards 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.000
 p in the year 69 but is in the Navy of the year 91 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.209
 We have ten years of ship's flagging 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.309
 I still have there in February 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.819
 the 92 and from January of 93 was doing the antarctic 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.369
 uninterrupted 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.459
 before that function he fulfilled another that was different 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.659
 with our beloved apart from the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.739
 me of normal functions during the year 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.509
 although salvage ges 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.169
 in the month of January is committed to the campaign let's talk a little about the 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.409
 measures of the vessel what are 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.409
 the boat is 72 meters 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.930
 for those with cargo as we are now going to do four meters and it is in favor of 4 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.229
 30 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.939
 and if we talk a little bit about what only the compartments of the boat 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.770
 on how we could go 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.799
 differentiating from brand 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.299
 the boat as everything there is that is divided in compartments estanco was 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:40.870
 preceded 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.349
 nine watertight compartments 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.379
 It has two wineries one hold in the bow and another hold a little off transport 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.509
 load 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:55.389
 also d specific areas because it has a capacity of ap 11 or abuses 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.269
 to work in depth as are the diving bell 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.099
 which allows to operate high depths uses 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.089
 with linked with a hyperbaric chamber bell if it serves for in 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:10.909
 treatment of illnesses of usero as to support the courses to their 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.699
 tasks to work depth 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.650
 also has an air bank of one million 600 thousand liters of air that 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.759
 also serves to support the Russians as to refloat a 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.359
 boat if necessary 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.020
 has towing capacity capable of fighting fires in other vessels 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.400
 a symptom that gives protection and also allows it to operate in waters 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 with fuel sold 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.760
 Within the capacity of the ship, the fact that it has a motor pump stands out 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.800
 of bilge capacity in case of flood 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 covered 20 tons hydraulic trailer swell 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.259
 underwater lighting equipment and welding three water and foam cannons 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.280
 with pump to put out fires and can transport up to 85 tons of cargo 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.649
 the avant-garde crew the vanguard staff as soon as 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:09.389
 estimated how many are you navigating 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.710
 in this campaign we are going to 67 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.439
 goes to the normal envelope of the vessel reinforced by 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.199
 the meteorologists 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.520
 people specialized in the contingency of control of spills in case you can 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.490
 see a small hard rock spill will be greater or fuel your 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.809
 mansion people prepared and the necessary equipment to 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.749
 minimizing as much as possible everything that could be contaminated 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.469
 we also carry electronic in case we have a fault for 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.529
 for fields repaired on board 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.429
 asks for some complement a specific matter e machines or 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:45.729
 from 7 lake to complement as it is a very long trip 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.979
 the normal rate plus the machine room in which the same photo consists 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.190
 engines and demarcation 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.729
 this ship has a direct says promotion 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.490
 dish the direct with percent and passed control 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.099
 has two 1808 engines each 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.439
 and has a power plant composed of three generators 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.479
 what enagás abnormal we use one only the example area 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.279
 as backup 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.900
 on this day the vanguard ship departed from the port of Montevideo and 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.419
 will return in the first days of February 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.620
 in this trip the ship transports 150 thousand liters of gas oil for 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.050
 generators of the base thousand 200 liters of naphtha 10 thousand liters of fuel for 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.080
 helicopters thousand liters of oil for electricity generators and 30 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 tons of foodstuffs 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.520
 Argentine cargoes that this year will transport the vanguard towards 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.110
 Antarctic territory highlights a communication antenna of 30 meters of 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.860
 high 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.669
 within the framework of the Antarctic treaty on environmental protection 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:10.330
 ambient 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.409
 Waste generated during the past year will be removed from the base 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:18.929
 the vanguard ship sooner or later in the morning heading to Antarctica and every 

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:21.229
 one of his missions the white continent 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.879
 they are a source of pride 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:23.740
 for the nation
