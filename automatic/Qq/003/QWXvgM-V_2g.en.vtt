that the astrocyte
is<00:00:33.739> very<00:00:34.250> important<00:00:34.760> for<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.870> energy<00:00:36.260> balance

but what we discovered in this paper is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.840 
but what we discovered in this paper is
that<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:42.769> may<00:00:42.920> also<00:00:43.070> be<00:00:43.309> important<00:00:43.730> for

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
that it may also be important for

that it may also be important for

no one thought that the astrocytes
played<00:01:14.030> an<00:01:14.210> important<00:01:14.690> cognitive<00:01:15.260> role<00:01:15.680> but

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
played an important cognitive role but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.420 
played an important cognitive role but
now<00:01:16.550> that<00:01:16.910> we<00:01:17.540> can<00:01:17.780> study<00:01:18.650> that<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:19.160> modern

techniques were beginning to appreciate

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.350 
techniques were beginning to appreciate
that<00:01:21.560> maybe<00:01:21.770> that's<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.400> edge<00:01:22.520> he<00:01:22.820> had<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.210> us

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that maybe that's the edge he had on us

it's been very difficult to study and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's been very difficult to study and
our<00:02:14.190> results<00:02:15.190> are<00:02:15.660> probably<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> first<00:02:17.190> that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
our results are probably the first that

our results are probably the first that
are<00:02:18.459> really<00:02:18.790> pinning<00:02:19.239> down<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.480> link<00:02:20.080> between

are really pinning down the link between

are really pinning down the link between
these<00:02:20.890> gamma<00:02:21.130> oscillations<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.870> cognitive

so<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.990> study<00:02:29.530> couldn't<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.130> been<00:02:30.220> done

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
so this study couldn't have been done

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.580 
so this study couldn't have been done
