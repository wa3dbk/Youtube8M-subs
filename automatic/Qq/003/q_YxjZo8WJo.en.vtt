00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the end of his freshman year but his

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.069 
the end of his freshman year but his
skill<00:01:56.130> level<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.700> remarkable<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> freshman

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
skill level was remarkable as a freshman

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.660 
skill level was remarkable as a freshman
and<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.799> he<00:01:58.829> wouldn't<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.159> grown<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and even if he wouldn't have grown and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
and even if he wouldn't have grown and
developed<00:01:59.939> into<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> 270-pounder<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> now

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
it's kind of really surprised me and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.490 
it's kind of really surprised me and
he's<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:17.010> good<00:04:17.190> all-around<00:04:17.250> player<00:04:17.970> isn't

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
he's just a good all-around player isn't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.990 
he's just a good all-around player isn't
he<00:04:19.500> certainly<00:04:19.890> is<00:04:20.190> he's<00:04:20.400> going<00:04:20.610> straight<00:04:20.760> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
he certainly is he's going straight to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.220 
he certainly is he's going straight to
the<00:04:21.060> hall<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.269> fame<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> matter<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.140> fact

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
the hall of fame as a matter of fact

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.710 
the hall of fame as a matter of fact
coach<00:04:22.710> what<00:04:23.010> kind<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.280> student<00:04:23.700> was<00:04:24.420> LeBron

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
coach what kind of student was LeBron

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.010 
coach what kind of student was LeBron
James<00:04:25.520> LeBron<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.760> very<00:04:26.970> conscientious<00:04:27.840> and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
James LeBron was very conscientious and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.870 
James LeBron was very conscientious and
I<00:04:28.110> think<00:04:28.350> that's<00:04:28.830> one<00:04:29.100> thing<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.490> makes<00:04:29.640> him

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
I think that's one thing that makes him

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.270 
I think that's one thing that makes him
such<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.480> great<00:04:30.600> player<00:04:31.050> today<00:04:31.230> is<00:04:31.590> he's<00:04:32.010> very

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
such a great player today is he's very

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.730 
such a great player today is he's very
disciplined<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.120> think<00:04:33.840> he's<00:04:33.990> better<00:04:34.200> mentally

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
disciplined I think he's better mentally

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.380 
disciplined I think he's better mentally
than<00:04:34.860> he<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.130> physically<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.060> quite<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
than he is physically which is quite a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.570 
than he is physically which is quite a
statement<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.560> thought<00:04:38.070> he<00:04:38.160> did<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.370> really

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
statement and I thought he did a really

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.690 
statement and I thought he did a really
good<00:04:38.790> job<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.300> classroom<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.550> what<00:04:41.550> one

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700
