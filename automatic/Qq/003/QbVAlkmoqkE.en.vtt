00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
recommend doing that like leaving a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.410 
recommend doing that like leaving a
little<00:03:58.810> space<00:03:59.049> at<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.560> edges<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.239> gives

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
little space at the edges it just gives

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.569 
little space at the edges it just gives
it<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.569> little<00:04:01.690> more<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.139> neat<00:04:02.319> look<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.370> when

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
it a little more of a neat look so when

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.660 
it a little more of a neat look so when
you<00:04:03.700> put<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.299> your<00:04:05.069> servants<00:04:06.069> like<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.400> dark

in my house right now when you put it in
your<00:04:09.609> binder<00:04:10.239> you<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.690> put<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.109> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
your binder you just put it in the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:20.759 
your binder you just put it in the
sleeve<00:04:11.650> up<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:13.709> put<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.799> in<00:04:14.859> backwards

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.290 

fixed<00:04:21.769> one<00:04:21.949> picture<00:04:22.280> ID<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.550> coming<00:04:22.879> off<00:04:23.000> I

fixed one picture ID is coming off I
just<00:04:23.870> literally<00:04:24.199> did<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:24.650> now<00:04:24.979> I'm<00:04:25.129> putting

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
just literally did this now I'm putting

it<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.639> binder<00:04:25.819> so<00:04:26.090> it's<00:04:26.210> probably<00:04:26.389> not<00:04:26.509> a

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
it in the binder so it's probably not a

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.869 
it in the binder so it's probably not a
good<00:04:26.780> idea<00:04:27.129> probably<00:04:28.129> let<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.430> dry<00:04:28.550> before<00:04:28.580> you

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879

good idea probably let it dry before you
put<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.270> binder<00:04:29.419> but<00:04:29.690> anyway<00:04:30.560> when<00:04:30.770> you

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
put it in the binder but anyway when you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.230 
put it in the binder but anyway when you
put<00:04:31.009> it<00:04:31.099> in<00:04:31.159> the<00:04:31.280> binder<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:31.819> is<00:04:31.970> how<00:04:32.090> it's

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
put it in the binder this is how it's

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.879 
put it in the binder this is how it's
going<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.449> look<00:04:32.509> and<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.409> just<00:04:33.590> gives<00:04:33.800> your

like<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.870> s<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.379> you<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:42.889> make<00:04:43.039> one<00:04:44.000> that

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120
