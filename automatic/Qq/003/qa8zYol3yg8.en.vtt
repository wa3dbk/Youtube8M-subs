00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
had nothing to do with the wilderness I

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.740

go into and we might have a chance
Club<00:01:39.600> Penguin<00:01:39.780> could<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
Club Penguin could use it for a
