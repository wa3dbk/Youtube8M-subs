 hello everyone welcome once more 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.500
 at alimÃ³n dotcom today we continue in the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.080
 cook because we're going to keep talking about 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 complementary feeding in the video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.900
 past I showed you how to introduce little to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 little new fruits from 6 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 months and how to prepare a porridge 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.760
 Basic but very nutritious fruits can 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.460
 click on the image to go to this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.010
 video or the link is below in the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 today's description we're going to talk about a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.890
 food that causes many doubts between 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.719
 moms and dads and is the egg as a norm 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.120
 It is recommended to enter the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.550
 egg from 11 m the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 introduction is going to be very slow little to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 little will last almost a month we are going to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 start with the yolk rich in fats and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.309
 then let's continue with the clear rich 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 in proteins the clear one is also the one 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.350
 more allergens has the most 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.950
 probability has to cause allergies to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.440
 our baby why go to wii 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.780
 to separate the white and the yolk we are going to 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.600
 make a new hard is the way more 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.090
 easy to separate them well we put to do 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.960
 our hard-boiled egg at least eight 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 minutes that is very hard very cooked 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.729
 well here we see that boiling the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.729
 egg we can easily separate the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.820
 clear of the yolk cut in half and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.500
 the rest we separate it with our fingers 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 let's start the first week 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.860
 offering only half bud we can 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.899
 add it to the vegetable puree or offer it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.869
 small pieces for our baby 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.060
 chew the second week if we see 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.450
 that there is no allergic reaction 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.660
 we can offer the whole bud the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.690
 we will offer twice a week the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.030
 third week we will pass halfway through 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.149
 egg the day we choose to offer 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.830
 to our baby this half egg 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.280
 we will decrease the amount of other 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.560
 proteins like chicken meat fish to the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.979
 half the egg white has a large 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.989
 protein intake and already the fourth and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.050
 the last week of the election of the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.300
 egg we will give the whole egg and 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.940
 days we choose to offer the egg 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.770
 whole we will not give any variety 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.100
 protects 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 neither meat nor chicken nor fish the egg 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.470
 will be the baby's protein intake in 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 that good food we already saw how 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.150
 introduce the egg little by little when 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.820
 our baby has approved everything 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.370
 whole egg we should start giving it 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.950
 egg twice a week we can 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.340
 offer as a hard egg in tortilla 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.560
 scrambled egg or mix it in your mashed 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.080
