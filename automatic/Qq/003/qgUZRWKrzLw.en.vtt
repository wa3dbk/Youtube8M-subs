00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
forgetting to do it but I haven't

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.630 
forgetting to do it but I haven't
crafted<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.890> yet<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.340> don't<00:00:17.580> have

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
crafted it yet because I don't have

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
crafted it yet because I don't have
enough<00:00:18.109> money<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> probably<00:00:22.289> I'm<00:00:22.500> done<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:23.400> I

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
enough money so probably I'm done when I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.740 
enough money so probably I'm done when I
can<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.900> all<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.140> stuff<00:00:25.439> i'll<00:00:25.650> probably<00:00:26.420> but<00:00:27.420> i

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
can do all my stuff i'll probably but i

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.029 
can do all my stuff i'll probably but i
don't<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.050> i<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> buy<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.800> i

don't know if i want to buy this one i

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.339 
don't know if i want to buy this one i
just<00:00:29.730> want<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> let<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.119> sit<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.660> because

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
just want to let it sit for now because

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.889 
just want to let it sit for now because
it<00:00:31.920> doesn't<00:00:32.189> look<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> great<00:00:32.910> but

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
looks like but I'm just not sure if I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
looks like but I'm just not sure if I
really<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> craft<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.800> yet<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.670> i'll
