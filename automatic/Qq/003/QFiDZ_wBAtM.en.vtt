00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
settings before I actually log into a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
settings before I actually log into a
computer<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.320> give<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> demonstration

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
computer and give the demonstration

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
computer and give the demonstration
right<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> set<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.420> high<00:00:39.750> color

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
right now I have it set on high color

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.810 
right now I have it set on high color
because<00:00:40.440> i'm<00:00:40.559> using<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.980> local<00:00:41.160> network<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because i'm using a local network so

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
because i'm using a local network so
it's<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.090> fast<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:42.719> you're<00:00:43.079> using<00:00:43.230> any

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's really fast if you're using any

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.560 
it's really fast if you're using any
sort<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.950> cellular<00:00:44.399> data<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.090> probably<00:00:45.390> want

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
sort of cellular data you probably want

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959 
sort of cellular data you probably want
to<00:00:45.629> drop<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.379> 256<00:00:47.070> color<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to drop that down to 256 color just to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
to drop that down to 256 color just to
make<00:00:48.120> things<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.690> faster<00:00:49.110> i<00:00:49.289> also

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
make things a little bit faster i also

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
make things a little bit faster i also
have<00:00:50.010> full<00:00:50.250> screen<00:00:50.579> unchecked<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> i<00:00:51.629> can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have full screen unchecked so that i can

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
have full screen unchecked so that i can
use<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> keyboard<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> fit<00:00:53.190> remote<00:00:53.489> desktop

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.080 
use the keyboard and fit remote desktop
to<00:00:54.090> screen<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> highest

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
