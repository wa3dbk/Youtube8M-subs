00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to a different portal in a cave and I'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
to a different portal in a cave and I'm
currently<00:00:54.270> building<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.320> highway<00:00:55.649> out

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
currently building a the highway out

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.189 
currently building a the highway out
that<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that way to get it over there and I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
that way to get it over there and I
guess<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.590> show<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
guess I could show you that it's it's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
guess I could show you that it's it's
not<00:00:59.670> even<00:00:59.940> I'd<00:01:00.719> say<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> third

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
not even I'd say it's only about a third

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.700 
not even I'd say it's only about a third
of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.460> far<00:01:02.670> maybe<00:01:03.059> halfway

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
of the way there so far maybe halfway

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.550 
of the way there so far maybe halfway
but<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.860> coming<00:01:05.040> along<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:07.229> ran<00:01:07.439> into

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
but it's coming along and it ran into

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
but it's coming along and it ran into
this<00:01:07.740> natural<00:01:08.250> cave<00:01:08.490> formation<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.119> here

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this natural cave formation right here

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
this natural cave formation right here
which<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> actually<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.229> base<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.130> second<00:01:11.640> base

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
which is actually a base the second base

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
which is actually a base the second base
I<00:01:11.970> ever<00:01:12.119> set<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.950> lost

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I ever set up right here and then I lost

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.330 
I ever set up right here and then I lost
and<00:01:14.549> could<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.909> find<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.100> reason<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and could not find and the reason was it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.679 
and could not find and the reason was it
was<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> valley<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.119> never<00:01:18.420> walked

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
was just in a valley I never walked

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.170 
was just in a valley I never walked
through<00:01:18.810> ever<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.700> guess<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.060> outside

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through ever I guess I could go outside

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
through ever I guess I could go outside
hopefully<00:01:21.869> there's<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.110> creepers<00:01:22.590> waiting<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
hopefully there's no creepers waiting to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.340 
hopefully there's no creepers waiting to
destroy<00:01:23.070> me<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:25.080> usually

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
as soon as I finished building at the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.530 
as soon as I finished building at the
outside<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:50.880> kind<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.150> got<00:03:51.209> bored

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
Minecraft you just got to be smart about

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.950 
Minecraft you just got to be smart about
it<00:05:47.800> oh<00:05:48.150> look<00:05:49.150> at<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.270> actually<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.810> is

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
it oh look at that actually that is

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.870

where<00:05:50.110> do<00:05:50.260> i<00:05:50.380> return<00:05:50.980> portal<00:05:51.430> is<00:05:51.580> from<00:05:51.790> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
where do i return portal is from the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.400 
where do i return portal is from the
nether<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:52.540> i<00:05:52.750> guess<00:05:52.930> i<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.170> show<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.290> that

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
nether so i guess i can show you that

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.660 
nether so i guess i can show you that
while<00:05:53.590> I'm<00:05:53.680> over<00:05:53.860> here<00:05:53.950> too<00:05:56.400> it's<00:05:57.400> got<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.610> be

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
while I'm over here too it's got to be

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.130 
while I'm over here too it's got to be
careful<00:05:57.850> because<00:05:58.180> this<00:05:58.510> area<00:05:58.810> seems<00:05:58.990> to

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
careful because this area seems to

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.600 
careful because this area seems to
always<00:05:59.350> be<00:05:59.500> crawling<00:05:59.920> with<00:05:59.950> creepers<00:06:00.400> when<00:06:00.580> I

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
always be crawling with creepers when I

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.480 
always be crawling with creepers when I
get<00:06:00.850> over<00:06:01.060> here<00:06:01.240> why<00:06:01.690> I<00:06:01.720> don't<00:06:02.200> know<00:06:02.380> I<00:06:02.620> guess

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
get over here why I don't know I guess

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.370 
get over here why I don't know I guess
they<00:06:03.760> just<00:06:03.790> they<00:06:04.390> like<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.720> fire<00:06:04.960> I've<00:06:05.170> set<00:06:05.350> up

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
they just they like the fire I've set up

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.220

over<00:06:05.650> here<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:06.300> think<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:07.420> cut<00:06:07.720> that<00:06:07.750> thing<00:06:07.930> into

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
over here I think I cut that thing into

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.360 
over here I think I cut that thing into
the<00:06:08.320> wall<00:06:08.500> otherwise<00:06:08.860> I<00:06:09.040> guess<00:06:09.190> that's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
