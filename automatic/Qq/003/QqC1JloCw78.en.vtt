00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
organizations that's going to be another

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.010 
organizations that's going to be another
huge<00:03:46.220> problem<00:03:47.210> for<00:03:47.570> these<00:03:47.690> organizations

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
huge problem for these organizations

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.900 
huge problem for these organizations
that<00:03:48.500> depend<00:03:48.830> on<00:03:48.950> those<00:03:49.160> donations<00:03:49.730> to

that depend on those donations to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.750 
that depend on those donations to
survive<00:03:50.210> so<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:51.590> fact<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.310> going<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.640> be

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.900 
survive so the fact is it's going to be
absolutely<00:03:53.680> devastating<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.580> occurs

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
absolutely devastating if that occurs

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.460 
absolutely devastating if that occurs
and<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.330> going<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.540> change<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.140> very<00:03:57.350> nature

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
and it's going to change the very nature

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.760 
and it's going to change the very nature
of<00:03:58.190> how<00:03:58.850> these<00:03:59.030> organizations<00:03:59.590> operate<00:04:00.590> if

of how these organizations operate if

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.520 
of how these organizations operate if

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
they can operate at all and if they pull
