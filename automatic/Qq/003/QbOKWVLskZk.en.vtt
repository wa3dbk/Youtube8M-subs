Birmingham just give us your thoughts on

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.759 
Birmingham just give us your thoughts on
that<00:02:29.489> performance<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.320> just<00:02:31.320> thought<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.590> took

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
that performance I just thought it took

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.740 
that performance I just thought it took
was<00:02:31.950> once<00:02:32.670> again<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.030> took<00:02:33.180> us<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.540> bit

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
was once again it took us a little bit

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.780 
was once again it took us a little bit
too<00:02:34.260> long<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.890> into<00:02:35.100> our<00:02:35.220> rhythm<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.730> get

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
too long to get into our rhythm and get

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
too long to get into our rhythm and get
our<00:02:35.910> momentum<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.050> think<00:02:37.440> by<00:02:37.590> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
our momentum going and I think by then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.699 
our momentum going and I think by then
you<00:02:38.010> always<00:02:38.190> playing<00:02:38.430> catch-up<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.709> it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
you always playing catch-up and it's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.080 
you always playing catch-up and it's
just<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.250> need<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.790> need<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.000> get

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
just what we need we just need to get

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
just what we need we just need to get
into<00:02:42.300> games<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.570> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:42.870> earlier<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
into games a little bit earlier and and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.290 
into games a little bit earlier and and
almost<00:02:43.920> stick<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.489> plan<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.000> we've

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
almost stick to the plan that we we've

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.910 
almost stick to the plan that we we've
spoke<00:02:45.540> about<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.080> then<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> know

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
spoke about and then I think you know

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
spoke about and then I think you know
we'll<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.100> ok<00:02:47.400> obviously<00:02:48.269> bitterly

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
we'll be ok obviously bitterly

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
disappointed that we didn't get some

surahs<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> day<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.810> didn't<00:02:52.019> really<00:02:52.170> get

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
surahs all the day we didn't really get

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.120 
surahs all the day we didn't really get
all<00:02:52.530> cleared<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:54.080> bought<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.530> sloppy<00:02:55.830> goals

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
all cleared and bought to sloppy goals

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.190 
all cleared and bought to sloppy goals
probably<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.209> my<00:02:57.390> mistakes<00:02:57.750> or<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.989> first

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
probably one of my mistakes or the first

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.890 
probably one of my mistakes or the first
ones<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.680> slip<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.190> bottom<00:02:59.750> overall<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> think

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
ones to slip in bottom overall I think

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
ones to slip in bottom overall I think
we<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:02.010> disappointed<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.670> their<00:03:02.880> M
