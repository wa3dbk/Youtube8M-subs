00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 10 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.980
 but no 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 and in this second video of the 2nd they write 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.799
 bom I will talk about the episodes 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 graduates keep the united and we have 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.570
 that speak the floor of which continue the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.400
 main bed and what else with different 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 approaches to mergers between 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 son-in-law and like ours doing up 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.529
 now I will tell you my impressions 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.779
 personals of these episodes first 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
 we have the episode of holding together 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 in which we will see how after 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 find the attempts by in a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 character and two goes back to the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 daycare and surprise surprise there 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.000
 was and now to garnett and steven 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 should see what are the reasons for 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.699
 lost in that dreary place in a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 motive and informative episode that will give 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.469
 much to talk about in the future and how 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.660
 I always remind you that from 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
 this moment there is massive spoiler of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.609
 episode and next so go to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.140
 see it if you have not done it yet and enjoy 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.140
 of the rest of this video 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.520
 and here we have another episode reason for 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.350
 garnett that if you have already surprised that your 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 fusion is made of two gems 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 in love now we see the opposite in 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.409
 this episode 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.020
 we see functions between gems bound to 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.390
 do something Frankenstein style if you 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.789
 can you call him in some way that we 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.039
 showed a great the frail and empathetic 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.039
 with his sister gems that had this 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.049
 cruel fate something that goes against all 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.530
 ideology that I had presented you 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.409
 before and a new danger for a future 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.840
 not so far in this show also 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.640
 interesting pressure that wave will mean 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.979
 a little more of the mergers in this 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 episode when searching never regret that 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.360
 we can think that it is a decision of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.789
 that two gems or more can even be the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.740
 forced merger something that surely 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.649
 will open a lot of new theories by 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.689
 part of the fans being the only one who 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.429
 remembered the classic persecutions of 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.179
 the cartoons now with those of 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.479
 lost just look at that maybe he gives 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.479
 a track 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.970
 and no points against this episode has 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.400
 left more questions than answers but that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.920
 they were not close to mergers and how 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.200
 they are in only one state but one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.560
 lifestyle or action in two 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 gems and can even be love and only 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.480
 we can expect to see with more than yet 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.740
 continues to come out in future chapters and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.380
 for the next episode entitled 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.390
 we have to talk where we see how 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.700
 after showing his father that the ico 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.620
 nor can they merge it will tell you the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.380
 story of how he discovered mergers 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.650
 and how he tried to merge with his mother 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.110
 in another episode focused on blogs and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.209
 where we will see how these two will sit 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.020
 to strengthen their ties in the course 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.020
 of the chapter 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.750
 the integrates gables relationship has been 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.330
 what else have we wanted to see in this series 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.670
 and now we look for a more direct side 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.950
 seeing how is the conflict of Greg the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.440
 not being able to have a direct connection with 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 rose compared to what she has 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.480
 with the others james on his way to achieve 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.060
 that would be through a merger that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.530
 course I could never achieve but in 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.860
 this episode tried an approach 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.989
 different than what we saw in this and 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.239
 how both should be known more thoroughly 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 to achieve a stable relationship like the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.010
 that could have a merger to 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.430
 comparison which doctor pretty 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.190
 satisfied as a fan of this series if there 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.860
 something that stands out from this time is that 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.840
 your nation has improved a lot but in 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.630
 this particular episode I remove the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.610
 hat because maybe that's the best 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 episode as to being visual it 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.980
 refers is an animation delight 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.680
 fill you up that my eyes thank quite 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 that make it difficult for me to miss this 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.010
 detail among my opinions also 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.930
 we met more than pearl in this episode 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.870
 and it's official that she was also 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.019
 in love with graus and see how was her 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.660
 whole life gave better moments and 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.299
 most important of this episode that we 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.750
 showed a trade in call rainbow 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.470
 quartz in craig robins that will surely give 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 much to say in future days, that is, if 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.560
 have many fans here and it was also a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.260
 fan serve staff see more of gardel 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.150
 Amethyst in this episode of the first 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.490
 see the tips I had to add 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.160
 the truth seems a line of what 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.010
 would be in the future now and the second 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.270
 like a mini steven yeun is learning 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.270
 make humans 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.780
 the rose song was the one that many 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.400
 we had been waiting since his 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.449
 dubbing actress announced that there was 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.740
 recorded one but the truth I expected more 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.650
 I think it 's in one of the songs 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.770
 craziest until the date of this show and 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.529
 that although it's not bad it's not the song 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.080
 of the comet or gannett or even not 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.319
 is equal to the others but in 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.319
 finish 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.489
 without a doubt another great episode 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.589
 for this steven vowles where we 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.479
 show more about the relationship between 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.369
 Steven's parents along with more 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.919
 common background in which there are more 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:34.079
 in that time and their injury that they 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.509
 had of which is always welcome 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:39.539
 to show us more of this in the series 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.939
 and we are getting closer to the conclusion of 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.369
 this week of new chapters already 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.439
 only one is missing and I remind you that 

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:47.939
 in that review they would have boehner 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.939
 answering questions that have 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.889
 you fans of this show so 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.649
 wait for them in the next video and for 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.529
 Do not leave your doubts or opinions in the 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:01.019
 comments box this city or by 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:04.039
 this video and with this I say goodbye 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:04.039
 dear universe 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.840
 and finally one of the greatest mysteries 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.330
 of the series has finally been revealed 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.890
 we have seen how to wash steven's clothes 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.890
 Oh yeah
