00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.210
 ah 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.420
 ah 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.420
 nothing 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 90 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 in the morning and as you see here I 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.070
 I wake up when they sound alarm hate and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.570
 it is a graph and the evils I do not have 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 a lot to do in just a few 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
 how many leaders so a fence 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.280
 as very slow and I get up I proceed to 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.280
 check very mail and my social networks 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520
 now 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.549
 and now when I decide to stand up for 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 I fix my bed because I love the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.210
 organized meditation 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.210
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 and then I go to the bathroom to brush 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.689
 huge face and all those things that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.689
 one has to do with the mornings 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.799
 I do not know if you 're interested but the pasta 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.619
 dental use is the white of colgate and 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.990
 Well, to wash my face with this product 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.560
 de l'orÃ©al called go fit sixty 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.539
 clean and has this kind of scrabble 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.539
 that you pass through your face 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.690
 and the second step is to apply a tonic 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.390
 or an astringent of this vision of this 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.180
 pain since it 's great but it stings a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 little so that's why their eyes see me like that 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.729
 Chinese then I applied on my moisturizer 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.140
 that is the name they know I'm not 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.140
 trying now and I love 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.950
 and then from there I 'm heading towards the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.330
 cook make me breakfast and then in this 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.910
 day does not have much shadow so just 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.500
 there was warm water with lemon and a banana 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.600
 the warm water with lemon is great 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.330
 for the metabolism for what am I going to 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.930
 show what breakfast in a normal day 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.980
 which is a beautiful fruits green tea and water 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.170
 frost 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.970
 I love elaborate and then afterwards 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.560
 from there I go to my room again 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.560
 to start my day 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.829
 functionally what the mornings owe 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.629
 is to edit videos about the tarot 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.519
 any photo or any post that 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.170
 have build on the blog too 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.299
 Czech my social networks and learn that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.689
 a little bit with you on twitter or in 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.730
 instagram and basically is that until 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.730
 it's time to bathe 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.780
 and I think I do not have to explain how 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.780
 I masturbate the back 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 and then it can be the one in the bathroom what 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.370
 I do is make up but I take a 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.380
 time to do any kind of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.970
 call have to do before by 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.940
 example at this time I was calling 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.300
 to my university to open things from the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.300
 graduation and that and then finally 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.709
 ended up applying me in my makeup 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.450
 I will not explain in detail everything that 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.459
 I'm doing here because it's not a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.069
 tutorial for those I'm going to put on 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.810
 hardware so you see it more or less what 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.269
 It's what I do when I'm going to do 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.900
 stagecoaches or any kind of reality 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.030
 have planned 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.980
 I'm going to leave the link of my routine 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.159
 eyebrows in the information box here 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.140
 down today I did not make a 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.720
 makeup so natural that we say 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.480
 because I had a few meetings but 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.480
 basically what I do is very simple 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.819
 I always try to stay in nude tones 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.590
 so as not to see me very loaded 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.230
 and then I give extra love to my 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.110
 panda horrible dark circles 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.110
 I know how is my favorite number 2 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.120
 and a little bit of the least I can explain 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.260
 i 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.270
 apply some spray being 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.720
 depending if it's going to last a long time 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.720
 out of home 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.450
 and to apply I perfumed and combed my hair 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.250
 little that I really do not like and then 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.090
 fix my portfolio for the day this is 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.530
 from nine west and it's waterproof I love it 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.210
 and they go to girls that was all for the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.430
