midi controller keyboard and that's the
computer<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.360> I've<00:00:42.480> been<00:00:42.660> running<00:00:42.899> logic<00:00:43.410> on

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
computer that I've been running logic on

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.330 
computer that I've been running logic on
but<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> closed<00:00:45.030> logic<00:00:45.600> since<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.500> doing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
but I closed logic since I was doing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.450 
but I closed logic since I was doing
something<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> what's<00:00:49.739> open<00:00:49.920> logic

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
something on there but what's open logic

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.990 
something on there but what's open logic
shall<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:55.320> know<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.280> isn't<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
shall we I know this isn't really that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.860 
shall we I know this isn't really that
interesting<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.550> figure<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.879> why

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
interesting but I figure you know why

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.889 
interesting but I figure you know why
not<00:01:01.109> oh<00:01:01.410> does<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:03.239> look<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.870> doing

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
not oh does it look like I'm doing

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
not oh does it look like I'm doing
something<00:01:04.170> illegal<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.570> maybe<00:01:06.570> I'm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
something illegal down there maybe I'm

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.219 
something illegal down there maybe I'm
getting<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.229> free<00:01:07.439> plugins<00:01:07.979> no<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.810> would

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.100 
getting some free plugins no I would
never<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> oh<00:01:11.189> yeah<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.790> logic

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
never do that oh yeah there's logic

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.130 
never do that oh yeah there's logic
right<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> give<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.659> an<00:01:15.780> idea<00:01:15.869> of

right so just to give you an idea of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.130 
right so just to give you an idea of
what<00:01:16.409> i<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:17.700> logic<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:19.729> let's<00:01:20.729> uh<00:01:21.140> let's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
what i use logic for let's uh let's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.920 
what i use logic for let's uh let's
create<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> new<00:01:22.979> track<00:01:23.520> shall<00:01:24.060> we

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you can't see this at all because the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.330
