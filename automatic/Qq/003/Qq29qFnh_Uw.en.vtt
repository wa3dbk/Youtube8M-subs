yeah<00:00:00.599> hi<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:01.020> Tim<00:00:01.290> Gipson<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.040> talk

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
yeah hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.430 
yeah hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk
about<00:00:02.340> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> repair<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.449> ceiling<00:00:03.959> fan

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
about how to repair a ceiling fan

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.639 
about how to repair a ceiling fan
now<00:00:04.859> ceiling<00:00:05.310> fans<00:00:05.580> are<00:00:05.879> pretty<00:00:06.120> much

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
now ceiling fans are pretty much

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.160 
now ceiling fans are pretty much
maintenance-free<00:00:08.360> with<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> couple<00:00:09.900> of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
maintenance-free with a couple of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.799 
maintenance-free with a couple of
exceptions<00:00:10.759> now<00:00:11.759> if<00:00:11.910> your<00:00:12.059> ceiling<00:00:12.269> fan<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
exceptions now if your ceiling fan is

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.980 
exceptions now if your ceiling fan is
not<00:00:12.960> working<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.429> probably

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
not working at all it's probably

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
not working at all it's probably
something<00:00:16.070> extensive<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.460> far<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
something extensive to do as far as the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
something extensive to do as far as the
brushes<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> motor<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.859> typically

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
brushes are in the motor and typically

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880 
brushes are in the motor and typically
if<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.449> coming<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.140> all<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.740> it's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
if it's not coming out at all and it's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
if it's not coming out at all and it's
not<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.730> you've<00:00:23.939> checked<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.269> circuit

if it has something to do with a motor

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
if it has something to do with a motor
it's<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.590> caught<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.040> going

buying a new ceiling fan now something
that<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.320> easy<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> fix<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.510> repair<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:46.020> your

that is easy to fix and repair on your

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560 
that is easy to fix and repair on your
ceiling<00:00:46.379> fan<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> times<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.480> we

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
ceiling fan is a lot of times what we

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
ceiling fan is a lot of times what we
run<00:00:48.719> into<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.260> our<00:00:49.350> ceiling<00:00:49.800> fan<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.160> it's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
run into is our ceiling fan as it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.680 
run into is our ceiling fan as it's
running<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.730> start<00:00:51.000> wobbling<00:00:51.239> back<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
running will start wobbling back and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
running will start wobbling back and
forth<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.010> means<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> means

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
forth and what that means is that means

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
forth and what that means is that means
that<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.480> blades<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.469> gotten<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that your blades have gotten out of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
that your blades have gotten out of
balance<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.239> blade<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.780> maybe<00:00:57.960> two

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
balance you have one blade or maybe two

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.549 
balance you have one blade or maybe two
blades<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.579> heavier<00:01:00.059> than<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.230> others

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
blades that are heavier than the others

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
blades that are heavier than the others
so<00:01:02.520> how<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.180> determine<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.909> what<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so how we determine that is what you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
so how we determine that is what you
want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> take<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> ruler<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.700> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
want to do is take a ruler and you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.469 
want to do is take a ruler and you can
place<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:10.049> your<00:01:10.530> ceiling<00:01:11.479> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
place it up here on your ceiling and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
place it up here on your ceiling and
then<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.950> we'll<00:01:14.369> measure<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then what we'll do is we'll measure this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.359 
then what we'll do is we'll measure this
first<00:01:15.240> blade<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.350> blade<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
first blade and this first blade is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.200 
first blade and this first blade is
sitting<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.060> 10<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.420> 3/4<00:01:19.729> then<00:01:20.729> we'll<00:01:20.939> rotate

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
sitting at 10 and 3/4 then we'll rotate

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
sitting at 10 and 3/4 then we'll rotate
in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> next<00:01:22.020> blade<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:23.460> one's<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.880> 10<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
in the next blade that one's at 10 and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.560 
in the next blade that one's at 10 and
3/4<00:01:27.170> now<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.409> one's<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:28.829> 11<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:33.119> one's<00:01:33.360> at

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
3/4 now this one's at 11 this one's at

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
3/4 now this one's at 11 this one's at
11<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:36.659> one's<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.079> 11<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.220> actually<00:01:38.549> I've

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
11 and this one's at 11 so actually I've

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
11 and this one's at 11 so actually I've
got<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.659> particular<00:01:39.960> ceiling<00:01:40.530> fan<00:01:40.740> I've

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
got in this particular ceiling fan I've

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.960 
got in this particular ceiling fan I've
got<00:01:42.200> three<00:01:43.200> blades<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:43.950> 11<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> I've

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
got three blades that are at 11 and I've

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.870 
got three blades that are at 11 and I've
got<00:01:45.210> two<00:01:45.479> blades<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:47.250> 10<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> 3/4<00:01:48.799> so

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
got two blades that are at 10 and 3/4 so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
got two blades that are at 10 and 3/4 so
if<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.329> causing<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.259> most

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
if that was causing and that's most

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.539 
if that was causing and that's most
likely<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.729> will<00:01:53.970> cause<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.470> fans<00:01:55.549> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
likely what will cause the fans to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
likely what will cause the fans to
oscillate<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> couple<00:01:58.110> blades

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
oscillate when you have a couple blades

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
oscillate when you have a couple blades
like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.430> three<00:01:59.759> blades<00:02:00.000> over

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
like that so these three blades over

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
like that so these three blades over
here<00:02:00.509> are<00:02:00.630> heavier

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
here are heavier

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
here are heavier
these<00:02:02.100> three<00:02:02.430> blades<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.210> lighter

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
these three blades are actually lighter

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
these three blades are actually lighter
because<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> ceiling<00:02:04.649> fan<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.950> sitting<00:02:05.219> down

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because the ceiling fan is sitting down

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
because the ceiling fan is sitting down
so<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> add

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so what we want to do is we want to add

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
so what we want to do is we want to add
a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.670> weight<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> top<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.319> these

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
a little weight to the top of these

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.830 
a little weight to the top of these
blades<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.250> balance<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.790> out<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.239> how<00:02:12.810> we

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
blades to balance them out and how we

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.910 
blades to balance them out and how we
can<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
can do that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.970 
can do that
is<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.880> take<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> penny<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> penny<00:02:16.830> at

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
is just take a penny and take a penny at

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.240 
is just take a penny and take a penny at
a<00:02:17.040> time<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.900> would<00:02:19.080> tape<00:02:19.380> those<00:02:19.709> either

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
a time and we would tape those either

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
a time and we would tape those either
using<00:02:20.580> regular<00:02:20.970> tape<00:02:21.209> or<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.930> double<00:02:22.349> stick

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
using regular tape or a double stick

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220 
using regular tape or a double stick
tape<00:02:22.590> works<00:02:23.099> very<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.750> top<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.140> these

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
tape works very good to the top of these

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.559 
tape works very good to the top of these
two<00:02:25.530> blades<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.550> we<00:02:26.880> start<00:02:27.120> out<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:27.390> one

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
two blades so we start out with one

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.960 
two blades so we start out with one
penny<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.200> again<00:02:28.560> let<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.580> rotate<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
penny and then again let it rotate a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.660 
penny and then again let it rotate a
couple<00:02:30.300> times<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:31.709> come<00:02:32.040> back<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
couple times and then come back and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.650 
couple times and then come back and
measure<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.690> what<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
measure and what you want to do is you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.630 
measure and what you want to do is you
want<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.959> add<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.560> pennies<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> blades

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
want to add the pennies to the blades

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
want to add the pennies to the blades
that<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.420> higher<00:02:40.400> until<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.290> blades

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that are higher until all the blades

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
that are higher until all the blades
when<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.069> go<00:02:44.250> around<00:02:44.370> they're<00:02:44.819> all<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
when you go around they're all at the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.840 
when you go around they're all at the
same<00:02:45.630> height<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.590> once<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.920> do<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.670> have

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
same height so once you do that you have

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.750 
same height so once you do that you have
your<00:02:48.030> fan<00:02:48.480> blade<00:02:48.920> they're<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.069> balanced<00:02:50.610> out

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
your fan blade they're all balanced out

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.850 
your fan blade they're all balanced out
and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.630> should<00:02:51.840> eliminate<00:02:52.319> any<00:02:52.560> wobble

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
and then you should eliminate any wobble

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.690 
and then you should eliminate any wobble
whatsoever<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.569> your<00:02:54.900> ceiling<00:02:55.830> fan<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.640> I'm

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
whatsoever in your ceiling fan so I'm

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.190 
whatsoever in your ceiling fan so I'm
Tim<00:02:56.940> Gipson<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.540> how<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.840> fix<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
Tim Gipson and that's how to fix a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.709 
Tim Gipson and that's how to fix a
ceiling<00:02:58.530> fan
