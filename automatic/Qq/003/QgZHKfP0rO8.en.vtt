00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 adorned hello thierry game one end of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.480
 mesh that just left then that's 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.500
 a matter of stone manage a throne and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 a lot of fruits in my diet 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.309
 since january i'm a little worried i 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.509
 wonder if this is not due to the fact of the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.610
 detox release of toxins 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 acidification of mineralization for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.130
 balance the ph in frozen what 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.720
 plants at abc advises me to study 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.240
 but what plant will I advise you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.869
 already first thing if you body has 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.279
 need 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.449
 there is a release of toxins you are 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 put a lot more on fruits a 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.529
 acid release is obvious then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.239
 first do not worry enamel 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.890
 teeth rebuilding then 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.420
 so this is only transient no 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.250
 worry with that it is rebuilding very 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 well then for pc still annoying 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 on the water what can I tell you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.489
 is that if the body needs to tap 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.440
 in its mineral reserves so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.820
 deep and good is that it gets me out 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 not that the acids that are handed 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.449
 in circulation do not go out so that's 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.170
 in taizÃ© lack thouars that you have to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.180
 go see immediately an intestine 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 skin for dry brushing skin for 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 read an adapted game have strongly by the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 adapted rhin and adrenal plants for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.320
 the for the intestines 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 we talked about it too and you do not go out 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.260
 these acids because these acids so 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 orange dances they need a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.780
 neutrality by the millions that are 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 was there because they did not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.150
 can not go out by the mba remember 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 you well the goal in terms of negotiation 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.960
 it is not to be sicker as possible 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 it's not to release it's not deliberate 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 in the body his annuities or evacuate 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 by the emunctories and when we speak 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.729
 montois we talk about kidneys 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 intestines and skin it's x is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 not a sidewalk I know we hear 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.320
 often the liver and it's an hour 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.390
 a chemical transformation plant 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.189
 it allows biological transmutation 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.170
 it allows a lot of synths is a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 filter but this is by no means a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 missing you very useful liver but 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.960
 it's not cheap but you there are only 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.909
 3rd at the main points the lungs and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 who have sounded victory also put into 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.280
 road by very particular it oxidized 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
 weak acid but otherwise it's pau who 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.100
 third rank both kidneys and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 intestines 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.119
 there is only that when when you are in 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.560
 began to be eaten up by the acids 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.479
 who are liberated by your change 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 food by detoxination launched 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 by the fruits well that means that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.970
 you're nothing does not filter it means that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.670
 you are intestines does not allow to evacuate 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.040
 all 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.989
 so urgent that you go in that direction 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 it is urgent that you are 7 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.200
 works 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.380
 hop so go my little screen this is du
