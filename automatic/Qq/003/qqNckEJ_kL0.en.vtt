00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 Firstly the color and appearance under 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 inspiration from new ford geely 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.640
 which is on the cover of the fast and the furious 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.640

 dark blue stripes starts from behind 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 console and runs across it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 surface 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.890
 where also the forza logo flaunts 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 motorsport 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.469
 this paint has a cool effect like from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 ford geely paint and more saturated 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.799
 small ester super glossy icon in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.080
