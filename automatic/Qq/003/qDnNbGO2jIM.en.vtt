00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.910
 there are very good and to fuck and only 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.460
 commenting I'm on this piece of 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.750
 gameplay with the xp r the truth is that it is 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.969
 a very good game I do not want to say 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.349
 results for then for cha headlights 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.570
 because many people prefer not to say 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.769
 the result and good now 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.390
 explains in the class first say that 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.250
 well I had asked on twitter that 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.420
 would imply psoe wanted that and I had 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.160
 removed just this afternoon 3 that are 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.400
 playing a ratillo since during 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.439
 the week did not play much and well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.089
 I really got a 3 more simple from 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.320
 flights as I said on twitter this 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.179
 which is the one you have chosen by majority 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.470
 absolute we go in a crushing majority 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.330
 you want to see one involved a sniper 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.830
 that made a little while that we 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.810
 went up and also with this sniper is 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.080
 the last thing I was not up to you 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.370
 from diamond to channel and also good it 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.260
 had proceeded then one involved the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 minus 16 diamond which is the also 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.080
 the shotgun that I have left possible 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.850
 diamond to the channel pretty good and then 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.620
 a fifty-something one or forty and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.910
 peak one with the pwc as you have 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 confirmed that it is also quite 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.820
 well just the whores that kill me at 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.770
 end of the gameplay but good in the first 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 pretty good but not played so asa 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.250
 with or without when a little more tactical is 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.570
 saying will try that to not kill me 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 and he's cleaning respawn but hey 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
 you have chosen I am great choice 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.170
 the others were to rise and then others 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.850
 obviously days 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.770
 and as I always tell you, well, I have 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.570
 doubt or such because always because only 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.880
 asked by twitter what do you prefer 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.350
 see us and well I think you have chosen 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.689
 well because I like it so much 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.890
 play how to make this gameplay and also 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.140
 good as you are observing I am 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 He is playing with peers not long ago 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.170
 plays in a pretty good team is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.690
 say an equipillo then of 5 as in 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310
 this case to do a little bit of I put 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.220
 the rival and good before anything fixed this 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.600
 quasi situation I do a triple and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.340
 just when the last one comes out I'm going to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.110
 recharge and also fail right last 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520
 pulled air past the ear combing and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.409
 the truth is that I have to say it but 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.400
 I'm pretty bad with this sniper is the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.700
 that I like the least is super slow 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.830
 the mile already I tell you we put superlento 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.210
 the peephole goes super bad moves a 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.290
 pile when you shoot the good thing that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.600
 It has thus make submachine gun is not 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.010
 obviously but good 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.020
 what it would be like to say long ago 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.490
 that does not move with a team and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 really, it shows a lot when 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.940
 you take a team like this one from 5 and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.619
 for you have control of the enemy in the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.390
 backup and you usually know that upload 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.580
 channel company alone and I have to be 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.860
 pending that they make the guiris by 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.810
 where they get that they're covering and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.880
 really well you have is super attentive 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.489
 to everything and super alert so good is 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.220
 Well, thank you or once in a while 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.600
 which is for example a Sunday that is not 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.069
 almost nobody does anything you're not at home 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.930
 and such after to see the Saturday whatever 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.970
 then take a few pieces with friends on 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.530
 Sunday afternoon the truth is that it 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.290
 thank you and you stop for a long time apart 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.660
 well to play and that is a laugh and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 well how was it saying he implied in the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.750
 xp ere I will continue talking as a 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 A little bit of that, not why I do not like it 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.330
 this sniper like I told you 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.739
 looks like a super slow sniper not 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.120
 I know why but it's pretty bad as I've 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.950
 said pointing with the quick scope 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 no 21 but it's that neither one is like that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.180
 with the ballista and the srk if he did not miss 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.620
 no click or do not fail directly with 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.600
 this sniper is because I'm wrong 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.100
 accustomed or not always is that I am 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.650
 pretty bad or it would take me now or 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.200
 machine gun 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.329
 he did not kill directly so good me 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.590
 this sniper I do not see it to do 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.939
 gameplays like I'm doing now 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.989
 I'm also playing quite a bit is 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.489
 say I'm moving around the map 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.290
 so that the gameplay is the most enjoyable 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.730
 possible and I already tell you this frank 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 have to make gameplays I do not like 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.610
 I like to get my eclipse good from 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.620
 made for the amounts for assembly 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.010
 what I have of public or of sniper is 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.379
 better said because I have a quad fit with 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.310
 he and a triple of heads are not a 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.840
 Gold franc that goes very well for 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.670
 remove clips since semiautomatic 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.430
 it has a good damage the bad thing is that it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.599
 move a lot then good this one like 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.920
 I say it's pretty good to do that 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.269
 imply not because I do not like it is very 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.470
 slow and then you have to change with him 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.879
 to make a good game in this 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.099
 case not so because I had a good 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.269
 team could go a little bit more to my ball 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.459
 from time to time, yes, I am a 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.220
 little more than sure they did not know where 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.989
 was born the enemies so good here from 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
 again getting me his support the truth 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.109
 is that I do not recommend you absolutely 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 never if you are not going to make clip gets 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.430
 respond with shooter because you had 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.049
 always lose and good as I say 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.189
 this sniper and this map in 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.319
 concrete are very good to be done 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.629
 clips as you will see the electric that is 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.900
 at the end of the second part 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.060
 right in round 2 how do you see that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.130
 wall as the franchisor as 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.569
 and well I've already been with fast 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.160
 because being a gameplay interests me 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.450
 more than having more loaders 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.140
 while to recharge fast just in case 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.420
 people come running and such 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.400
 and good for me to do gameplay 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.100
 sorry clips as I recommend it is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.480
 with ballistic sheet with jackets and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.739
 with extended charger good if not os 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.390
 like ballistics in this case the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.520
 so I do not really put it, it's not 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.890
 to be noticed so super go do not be a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.000
 last but I like to use it in this 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.710
 case not because I wanted to put him 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.690
 jacketed and I wanted to take 4 if 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.160
 secondary and apart they searched for ice and 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.990
 hardness that is frank quiroga up 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.030
 many bullets 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.730
 then good as I tell you fit in the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.440
 intermission and as you will see just with it 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.390
 do a triple what happens that does not 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.550
 came the 4th the fourth enemy through 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.630
 of the wall and I could not kill him just 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.980
 they had gotten the ones that the others 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.810
 they were in the house and I do not get it 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.090
 to do but good, I already tell you that I have a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.590
 pair with him for assembly and both 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.910
 well I have also I'm also 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.970
 preparing another competitive assembly 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.480
 pretty good with good triple full 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.640
 teams wafd I have a quasi too 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.050
 I also had a job be one last in 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.550
 search and destroy but I do not know why the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.080
 capturing fails or just when killing 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.680
 one and has been so nothing because 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.570
 good things that happen and good in 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.100
 principle also tell us a little about 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.510
 theme of yesterday's promotion not the people 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.560
 there is a little there were people who are a 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.070
 little annoying because there was production 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.780
 Water 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.930
 stricklin is when more people the way 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.050
 promote one I sincerely I 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.760
 I say and I say it seriously if 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.470
 he does not like promotions, not that is not 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.970
 I'm going to do them, that is, it's something that 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.620
 I think it's good to do it because it helps 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.360
 people to grow if they want to grow in 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.400
 YouTube is difficult but if we are going to be 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.770
 with spades and nonsense because 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.020
 this one if not me then we take what we leave 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.699
 the only thing that I want last 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.400
 people get angry with me or between 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.770
 you so if I see that this continues 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.090
 so in the plan people are pricked with each other 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.159
 and such I will not do more promotions and 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.060
 all I want is to help and if I 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.889
 only that you get creation of 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.020
 promotions is that people leave 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.449
 harmed because it really happened 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.210
 Olympically and that you as 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.150
 see me eat me consider us 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.569
 It takes a lot less effort to see me 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.099
 Well, all the cleaners that you command 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.500
 classify them sort them and then 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.599
 choose one because choosing one is can 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.400
 being a thing is spinoza not because this one 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.840
 yes because this one does not or what level of 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.819
 gameplay that I gameplays can you 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.080
 send so that you sponsor me and really 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.550
 You put the level because 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.659
 you choose the promotion this district and 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.460
 immense I said the fact there is a 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.139
 promotion because apart from being a great 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.699
 channel because I have the channel and before 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.199
 of sponsoring someone I get into their 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.630
 channel and I see what does the work that 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.150
 they do and it seems good to me apart as well 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.500
 spent two more gameplays as I told you and 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.539
 I really think he deserved it not because 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.370
 variety of gameplays that happened to me and for 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.229
 level of gameplay in general what 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.580
 suit there in the promotion is one thing 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:48.220
 easy to do and I already tell you 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.870
 I think the promotion is well chosen 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.939
 obviously next month I will do another 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.409
 If you want it, we go because if I do not 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.210
 we have already said that supposes a lot 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.610
 less effort 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.380
 and in principle, as I told you 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.259
 send me a private with promotions here 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.270
 and I'll try and sort and view all 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.610
 then the gameplays in principle in a 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.410
 notebook on twitter no longer I 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.660
 put because I do not know why halfway through 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.030
 month they were all saved and I had to go back 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.130
 to request that he send me jce but 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.830
 good in principle nothing else I do not want 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.479
 To touch much more the subject and what else I wanted 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.259
 speak to you good a little bit talked about 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:25.419
 talk the assembly about the promotions 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.370
 and good to explain a little bit also some 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.740
 little bit of the gameplay as you will see there 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.000
 several times that I have caught the most average 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.680
 from the ground but I just have not caught 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.090
 to play with her but to defend myself 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.680
 you have seen that dead once even 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.720
 because they came to me from all sides not 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.789
 I could defend myself and I really caught him 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.650
 from the ground to get to the 23rd bursts 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:44.259
 but I really have the ground because that 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.030
 not to kill up close to go away 

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:47.380
 try to play all the time everything 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.150
 possible with the frank theory that it was a 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.190
 they implement gossip and that good 56 two 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.479
 starting pieces in my opinion I hope 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.380
 that you liked this simple you know 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:57.900
 if you liked to leave a liking 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.900
 favorites and subscribe for more goodbye
