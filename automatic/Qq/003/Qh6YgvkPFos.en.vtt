normally play catch the flag too much
but<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.370> thought<00:00:38.969> I'd<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.379> because<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but I thought I'd have a go because I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.979 
but I thought I'd have a go because I
had<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> Falls<00:00:41.129> match<00:00:41.430> coming<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
had a Falls match coming up and get a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.450 
had a Falls match coming up and get a
bit<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> practice<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.590> turned<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
bit of practice it turned out not to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
bit of practice it turned out not to
that<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> thought<00:00:45.239> I'd<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.539> adds<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that so I thought I'd use adds a

that so I thought I'd use adds a

too many videos in the last couple of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
too many videos in the last couple of
weeks<00:00:50.160> I've<00:00:50.820> been<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.239> sick<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> girl<00:00:51.960> from

my<00:00:54.510> voice<00:00:54.660> um<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> sound<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.329> old

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
my voice um I kind of sound like an old

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
my voice um I kind of sound like an old
man<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.350> couldn't<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.859> speak<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.250> so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
probably not the best voice for a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
probably not the best voice for a
commentary<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.940> been<00:01:03.120> working<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
look like good at snapping on 153 but
it's<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.380> fun<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> edit<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.490> thought

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it's pretty fun to edit them so thought

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.789

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
really can't wait to play it um just
kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> way<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> stop<00:01:45.960> say<00:01:46.110> warfare<00:01:46.500> 3<00:01:46.680> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
kind of way to stop say warfare 3 but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.170 
kind of way to stop say warfare 3 but
anyway<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.450> maps<00:01:48.810> look<00:01:49.079> excellent<00:01:49.590> I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
anyway that the maps look excellent I

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
anyway that the maps look excellent I
think<00:01:51.180> they're<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:51.960> set<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.350> really

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
think they're really well set out really

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820 
think they're really well set out really
detailed<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.420> bomb<00:01:55.320> places<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.100> social

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
detailed and the bomb places in social

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.190 
detailed and the bomb places in social
I<00:01:56.860> am<00:01:57.070> really<00:01:57.220> logical<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:58.990> great

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
I am really logical which is great

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
I am really logical which is great
because<00:01:59.440> they're<00:01:59.770> pretty<00:02:00.010> bad<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.400> 143<00:02:01.000> and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
because they're pretty bad in 143 and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.650 
because they're pretty bad in 143 and
from<00:02:03.220> what<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.370> saw<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.640> guns<00:02:04.000> look<00:02:04.330> pretty

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
from what I saw the guns look pretty

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.160 
from what I saw the guns look pretty
good<00:02:04.720> none<00:02:05.620> of<00:02:05.650> them<00:02:05.830> looks<00:02:06.070> too<00:02:06.370> overpowered

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
good none of them looks too overpowered

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.300 
good none of them looks too overpowered
and<00:02:08.170> they've<00:02:08.410> got<00:02:08.440> some<00:02:08.740> really<00:02:08.770> good<00:02:09.160> ideas

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and they've got some really good ideas

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.790 
and they've got some really good ideas
for<00:02:09.580> your<00:02:09.850> tats<00:02:10.090> mints<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.630> think<00:02:11.500> one<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.620> them

for your tats mints I think one of them

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.350 
for your tats mints I think one of them
is<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.880> one<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.180> put<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.560> where<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:16.180> can

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
is this one you can put on where you can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.290 
is this one you can put on where you can
see<00:02:17.290> through<00:02:17.680> walls<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:18.490> people<00:02:19.060> who<00:02:19.150> are

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.480 
see through walls to see people who are
standing<00:02:19.480> still<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.140> too<00:02:20.560> long<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.010> think<00:02:21.370> it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
standing still for too long I think it's

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.980 
standing still for too long I think it's
a<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.760> idea<00:02:22.170> there's<00:02:23.170> also<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:23.590> one

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
a really good idea there's also this one

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.780 
a really good idea there's also this one
we<00:02:25.990> can<00:02:26.260> choose<00:02:26.620> between<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> single<00:02:27.580> fire

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
we can choose between like a single fire

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.460 
we can choose between like a single fire
or<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> city<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> full<00:02:31.150> auto<00:02:31.720> which<00:02:32.290> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
or like a city or a full auto which is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.720 
or like a city or a full auto which is
really<00:02:32.620> good<00:02:32.770> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.950> want<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> customize<00:02:33.250> for

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
really good if you want to customize for

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.480 
really good if you want to customize for
like<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> long<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.360> short<00:02:34.630> range<00:02:34.840> map<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.280> really

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
like a long or short range map so really

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.270 
like a long or short range map so really
looking<00:02:36.700> forward<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:38.130> another<00:02:39.130> thing

a new dimension to that so yeah I have
to<00:02:50.260> check<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.590> out<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.920> bit<00:02:51.190> better<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.090> um

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
to check that out a bit better but um

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.050 
to check that out a bit better but um
the<00:02:53.200> perks<00:02:53.680> they<00:02:53.950> use<00:02:54.220> their<00:02:54.459> kind<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.760> got<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
the perks they use their kind of got a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.520 
the perks they use their kind of got a
mix<00:02:55.330> from<00:02:55.600> black<00:02:56.470> ops<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.860> modify<00:02:57.640> three

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
mix from black ops and modify three

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.130 
mix from black ops and modify three
there's<00:02:59.530> no<00:02:59.770> gun<00:03:00.280> altering<00:03:00.820> perks<00:03:01.209> there's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
there's no gun altering perks there's

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.680 
there's no gun altering perks there's
only<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.620> slight<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.250> hand<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.730> think<00:03:04.120> quick<00:03:04.420> draw

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
only a slight of hand I think quick draw

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.420 
only a slight of hand I think quick draw
is<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:08.080> an<00:03:08.200> attachment<00:03:08.560> on<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> gun<00:03:09.160> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
is a is like an attachment on a gun and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.310 
is a is like an attachment on a gun and
I<00:03:10.060> don't<00:03:10.269> think<00:03:10.450> there's<00:03:10.570> any<00:03:10.690> steady<00:03:11.170> aim

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
I don't think there's any steady aim

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.710 
I don't think there's any steady aim
anymore<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.239> too<00:03:13.300> worried<00:03:13.630> about

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
anymore so I'm not too worried about

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.220 
anymore so I'm not too worried about
that<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.320> don't<00:03:14.440> really<00:03:14.680> use<00:03:15.610> either<00:03:15.820> of<00:03:16.030> them

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
that but don't really use either of them

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.509 
that but don't really use either of them
another<00:03:17.230> thing<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.590> they've<00:03:17.890> changed<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
another thing is they've changed the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.570 
another thing is they've changed the
ghost<00:03:18.730> poke<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.360> um<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.890> only<00:03:20.920> works<00:03:21.340> if

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
ghost poke that um can it only works if

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.080 
ghost poke that um can it only works if
you<00:03:21.840> actually<00:03:22.840> moving<00:03:23.170> around<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.090> really

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
you actually moving around so really

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.360 
you actually moving around so really
good<00:03:25.269> if<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.350> get<00:03:26.560> stuck<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.980> game<00:03:27.160> with

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
good if you get stuck in a game with

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.600 
good if you get stuck in a game with
those<00:03:27.930> people<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:28.989> decide<00:03:29.830> they<00:03:30.190> want<00:03:30.400> to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
those people that decide they want to

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.729 
those people that decide they want to
sit<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.239> corner<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.959> then<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.530> end<00:03:32.650> up
