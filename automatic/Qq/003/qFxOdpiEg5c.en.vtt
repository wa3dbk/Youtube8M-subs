done here is put a clear coat on it and

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.510 
done here is put a clear coat on it and
it<00:00:31.770> came<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.340> nice<00:00:32.669> i<00:00:33.829> had<00:00:34.829> red<00:00:35.340> iron

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it came out really nice i had red iron

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.270 
it came out really nice i had red iron
oxide<00:00:36.149> some<00:00:37.970> symbols<00:00:39.140> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:41.130> piece<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
oxide some symbols on the piece and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
oxide some symbols on the piece and
didn't<00:00:44.280> expect<00:00:44.730> those<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.000> show<00:00:45.420> through<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
didn't expect those to show through it
all<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.290> thought<00:00:46.770> i<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:46.980> covered<00:00:47.399> those

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
all actually thought i had covered those

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.660 
all actually thought i had covered those
with<00:00:47.790> slip<00:00:48.710> because<00:00:49.710> i<00:00:49.890> didn't<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.280> know

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
with slip because i didn't really know

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.200 
with slip because i didn't really know
if<00:00:51.210> i<00:00:51.300> liked<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.860> but<00:00:52.860> through<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> firing

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
if i liked it but through the firing

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.139 
if i liked it but through the firing
process<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.960> kind<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.760> dogged<00:00:56.760> those

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
process that kind of really dogged those

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.439 
process that kind of really dogged those
down<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> i<00:00:59.270> like<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> okay<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:02.180> not<00:01:03.180> quite

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
down and i like it okay now so not quite

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.230 
down and i like it okay now so not quite
what<00:01:03.719> i<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.259> but<00:01:04.739> i<00:01:05.700> still<00:01:06.030> like

the<00:01:06.420> piece<00:01:09.590> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.889> a<00:01:11.179> red<00:01:12.179> clay<00:01:13.069> fired<00:01:14.069> very

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
the piece this is a red clay fired very

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.249 
the piece this is a red clay fired very
dark<00:01:15.529> for<00:01:17.539> whatever<00:01:18.539> reason<00:01:18.899> i<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.170> know

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
dark for whatever reason i don't know

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.639

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
maybe the kiln tamp was off left the red

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.089 
maybe the kiln tamp was off left the red

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
let it ran a bit and put some red iron

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.440 
let it ran a bit and put some red iron
