00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
into the season the heat was on what a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.590 
into the season the heat was on what a
great<00:02:11.920> pass<00:02:12.310> rush<00:02:12.580> Rutgers<00:02:12.970> halves

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and I think we had no sex or once act in

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.540 
and I think we had no sex or once act in
that<00:02:15.700> game<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:17.290> probably<00:02:17.440> my<00:02:17.620> fault<00:02:17.650> so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
that game so it's probably my fault so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550 
that game so it's probably my fault so
what<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> great<00:02:19.390> really<00:02:19.900> great<00:02:19.930> job<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.470> they
