00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this is a great stroller because it's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580 
this is a great stroller because it's
has<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:21.210> nice<00:00:21.330> rolling<00:00:21.810> resistance<00:00:22.050> which

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
has really nice rolling resistance which

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
has really nice rolling resistance which
means<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> rolls<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:23.970> easily<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
means that it rolls very easily it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
means that it rolls very easily it
doesn't<00:00:24.810> require<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> lot<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.560> force<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> push

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
doesn't require a lot of force to push

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.720 
doesn't require a lot of force to push
it<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.840> tires<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.529> extremely<00:00:28.980> light<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.490> think

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it the tires are extremely light I think

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.370 
it the tires are extremely light I think
the<00:00:29.820> whole<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.150> weighs<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.539> 23<00:00:31.140> pounds

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the whole thing weighs about 23 pounds

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.930 
the whole thing weighs about 23 pounds
and<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> far<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.809> pretty<00:00:34.110> happy<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
and so far I'm pretty happy with it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.930 
and so far I'm pretty happy with it
here's<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> shock<00:00:37.040> absorbers<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> there's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
here's the shock absorbers on it there's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
here's the shock absorbers on it there's
two<00:00:39.120> settings<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.590> under<00:00:41.010> seventy

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
two settings one for under seventy

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
two settings one for under seventy
pounds<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.899> 35<00:00:43.320> pounds<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pounds or I think it's 35 pounds and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
pounds or I think it's 35 pounds and
then<00:00:43.920> another<00:00:44.430> setting<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.480> 35<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
then another setting for over 35 and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.889 
then another setting for over 35 and
that<00:00:46.980> absorbs<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.969> bumps<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> things<00:00:48.780> like

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that absorbs the bumps and things like

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.180 
that absorbs the bumps and things like
that<00:00:50.719> but<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> nice<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:53.010> view

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that but it's got this nice little view

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
that but it's got this nice little view
where<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:54.079> your<00:00:55.079> kid<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.559> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
longer centered anymore and then I have

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
longer centered anymore and then I have
to<00:01:51.930> fix<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> again<00:01:52.920> luckily<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
to fix it again luckily you don't have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
to fix it again luckily you don't have
to<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> brake<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> lot<00:01:55.320> unless<00:01:55.710> you're

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to use the brake a lot unless you're

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
to use the brake a lot unless you're
going<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.490> steep<00:01:56.820> hills<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
going down really steep hills so that

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.590 
going down really steep hills so that
shouldn't<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.100> too<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.670> problem<00:01:59.880> but

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
shouldn't be too much of a problem but

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
shouldn't be too much of a problem but
I've<00:02:00.659> even<00:02:00.960> taken<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.590> REI<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.310> had

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
I've even taken it in to REI and had

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.859 
I've even taken it in to REI and had
them<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> best

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
them look at it and that was the best

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
them look at it and that was the best
they<00:02:04.079> could<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.590> said<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:04.920> basically

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they could do they said it's basically

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
they could do they said it's basically
just<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.579> cheap<00:02:05.790> brake<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:07.259> works<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
just a cheap brake it works but when you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.160 
just a cheap brake it works but when you
use<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.750> adjust<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
use it then you have to go adjust the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.770 
use it then you have to go adjust the
pads<00:02:10.379> again<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.890> least<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.340> experience

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
pads again at least in my experience

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.880 
pads again at least in my experience
another<00:02:12.780> problem<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
another problem I have

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.870 
another problem I have
is<00:02:14.100> adjusting<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.580> little

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
is adjusting the these little

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.270 
is adjusting the these little
adjustments<00:02:18.540> find<00:02:18.780> adjustments<00:02:19.319> upfront<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
adjustments find adjustments upfront to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.330 
adjustments find adjustments upfront to
make<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.540> little<00:02:21.720> knob<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
make this it's this little knob here is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.010 
make this it's this little knob here is
to<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.700> sure<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.330> rolling<00:02:24.720> straight

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
to make sure that it's rolling straight

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020 
to make sure that it's rolling straight
so<00:02:25.410> at<00:02:25.770> first<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.310> pulling<00:02:26.550> way<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
so at first it was pulling way to the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.840 
so at first it was pulling way to the
left<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.709> had<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.010> make<00:02:29.370> those<00:02:29.520> adjustments

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
left and I had to make those adjustments

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.940 
left and I had to make those adjustments
but<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.480> couldn't<00:02:30.840> actually<00:02:30.990> turn<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.590> little

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
but I couldn't actually turn this little

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.150 
but I couldn't actually turn this little
pit<00:02:32.280> knob<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.930> called<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.590> support<00:02:34.980> line

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
pit knob and I called the support line

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.490 
pit knob and I called the support line
and<00:02:35.459> she<00:02:36.390> even<00:02:36.570> tested<00:02:36.959> hers<00:02:37.110> out<00:02:37.290> she

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and she even tested hers out she

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.840 
and she even tested hers out she
couldn't<00:02:37.770> turn<00:02:37.890> her<00:02:38.130> Z<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> had<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
couldn't turn her Z there so I had to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.050 
couldn't turn her Z there so I had to
use<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> wrench<00:02:40.400> pretty<00:02:41.400> big<00:02:41.640> wrench<00:02:41.880> because

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
use a wrench pretty big wrench because

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.870 
use a wrench pretty big wrench because
just<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.630> normal<00:02:42.959> one<00:02:43.080> wouldn't<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.489> I

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
just a normal one wouldn't do it and I

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.430 
just a normal one wouldn't do it and I
finally<00:02:45.150> got<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.080> stuck<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
finally got I think it was just stuck to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
finally got I think it was just stuck to
the<00:02:46.530> paint<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.300> finally<00:02:48.300> got<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> rolling

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the paint I finally got it rolling

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.380 
the paint I finally got it rolling
straight<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:50.370> wheels<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.790> pretty<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
straight the wheels are pretty nice I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.390 
straight the wheels are pretty nice I
think<00:02:51.600> they<00:02:51.720> inflate<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.410> 70<00:02:52.950> psi

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
think they inflate to like 70 psi

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.610 
think they inflate to like 70 psi
something<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:54.989> have<00:02:55.350> mat

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
something like that but I have mat

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.360 
something like that but I have mat
around<00:02:55.739> 40<00:02:57.200> just<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.380> absorb<00:02:58.739> some<00:02:58.920> more<00:02:59.130> shock

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
around 40 just to absorb some more shock

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.650 
around 40 just to absorb some more shock
while<00:02:59.850> max<00:03:00.180> 60<00:03:00.600> psi<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:04.220> think<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.310> got<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> used<00:03:06.209> or

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
while max 60 psi I think I got a used or

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.770 
while max 60 psi I think I got a used or
an<00:03:06.930> open<00:03:07.800> box<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.280> Amazon<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.660> 260<00:03:10.320> 270

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
an open box on Amazon for like 260 270

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.479 
an open box on Amazon for like 260 270
here's<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.989> brake<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.830> handlebar

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
here's the brake up here the handlebar

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.630 
here's the brake up here the handlebar
is<00:03:14.970> not<00:03:15.300> adjustable<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.560> whatever<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.489> at

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
is not adjustable so whatever it's at

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.800 
is not adjustable so whatever it's at
you're<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.000> gonna<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.360> live<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.570> that

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
you're just gonna have to live with that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.190 
you're just gonna have to live with that
but<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> brakes<00:03:19.410> here<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.750> folds<00:03:21.989> up

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
but the brakes here and it folds up

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.720 
but the brakes here and it folds up
pretty<00:03:22.410> nice<00:03:22.650> I'll<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> put<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.579> in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
pretty nice I'll have to put that in

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.060 
pretty nice I'll have to put that in
another<00:03:23.850> video<00:03:24.329> clip<00:03:24.650> I'll<00:03:25.650> show<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.890> how

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
another video clip I'll show you how

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.500 
another video clip I'll show you how
that<00:03:26.100> folds<00:03:26.579> up<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:28.250> can<00:03:29.250> come<00:03:29.510> come

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that folds up this thing can come come

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.420 
that folds up this thing can come come
down<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.840> protect<00:03:31.170> from<00:03:31.320> rain<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:32.280> does<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
down to protect from rain and it does a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.660 
down to protect from rain and it does a
pretty<00:03:32.579> good<00:03:32.820> job<00:03:32.970> at<00:03:33.299> that

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
pretty good job at that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.270 
pretty good job at that
so<00:03:35.670> that's<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.120> quick<00:03:36.239> look<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.900> far

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
so that's just a quick look at it so far

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.759 
so that's just a quick look at it so far
as<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.459> can<00:03:38.579> see<00:03:38.850> if<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.780> start<00:03:39.840> walking<00:03:40.260> here

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
as you can see if I start walking here

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.740 
as you can see if I start walking here
and<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.310> sort<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:44.820> my<00:03:44.970> hand<00:03:45.209> off<00:03:45.329> for

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and I just sort of take my hand off for

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.390 
and I just sort of take my hand off for
a<00:03:45.780> second<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.410> just<00:03:46.620> keeps<00:03:46.769> rolling<00:03:47.070> that's

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
a second it just keeps rolling that's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150 
a second it just keeps rolling that's
how<00:03:47.610> easy<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.209> push<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.570> thing<00:03:49.160> so

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
how easy it is to push this thing so

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.280 
how easy it is to push this thing so
it's<00:03:50.760> also<00:03:50.910> got<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.269> safety<00:03:51.660> strap<00:03:51.900> here<00:03:52.140> that

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
it's also got the safety strap here that

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.550 
it's also got the safety strap here that
you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.500> put<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.799> your<00:03:52.980> wrist<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:54.440> case<00:03:55.440> the
