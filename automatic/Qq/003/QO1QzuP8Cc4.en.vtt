internet then you come over here to my

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:09.230 
internet then you come over here to my
controller<00:01:56.420> push<00:01:56.990> play

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.330

I could go back and forth with this my

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
I could go back and forth with this my
controller<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:13.530> also<00:02:13.800> screw<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:15.170> up

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
controller I can also screw up here up

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:26.500 
controller I can also screw up here up
and<00:02:16.410> down

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:35.400 

load<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> other<00:02:27.990> side<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.530> Freight<00:02:28.800> over

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.259
