 Friends says if we are more than friends 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.990
 since we are friends 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.020
 the channels 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.300
 that they contain in what we do is each 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.250
 you do what you think is right in the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.830
 moment and then we share each other 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 us and each other but 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.300
 basically it always falls on what 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.030
 you need one at the moment but the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.790
 we share all 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 but who inspired them in reality from 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.599
 a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
 it does not come so much because of the space 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.030
 but a kind of need 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.680
 we are the personality that by 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.200
 there are those who are the youtubers is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.840
 who are all day are creating 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.099
 constantly then it's not so much to 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.150
 to be inspired but rather how it rises as 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.569
 good breakfast we totally and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.819
 for me youtube is like life itself 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.950
 started showing how your life the most 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.930
 of youtube shows as a very facet 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.480
 natural is for me in fun 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.239
 filmed 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.849
 a project near and now as I 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.069
 I'm here in Buenos Aires about ten 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.310
 days this week we will be signing 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.459
 and I good together 2003 and toledistas 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.040
 we signed something out and together equal 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.080
 We have done something for some time now and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.819
 we always come back there's good vibes so 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.709
 we always do again and do not think about 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.080
 you go on the side the acting 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.770
 be in some joint novel be a 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.720
 program and I'm going for now 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.990
 in what are youtube channels you 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.040
 allow to grow without a roof with a 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.430
 freedom 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.220
 basically absolute so for now 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.010
 We do not look the other way, I think I speak 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.200
 on the side that this path is because 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.410
 we come the time and it is giving good 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.710
 results and we had a great time so 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.050
 there you do not come here we have the let's say 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.090
 I loved the truth I know 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.150
 obviously I knew them but the other side 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.620
 of the screen a pleasure I hope so 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.750
 keep growing because they have a lot to 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.340
 give and that is in sight if I want 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.320
 send a message to your fans that the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.880
 true that the 100 and they are like very 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.530
 pending you always wait 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.890
 very nice messages 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.890
 to do it 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.969
 behave quiet as well as moderate 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.969
 the complaint 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.420
