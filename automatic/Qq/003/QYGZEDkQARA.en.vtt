stairs and then we have different
colored<00:00:53.479> glass<00:00:53.720> obviously<00:00:54.940> chain<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.300> hangs

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
colored glass obviously chain that hangs

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.610 
colored glass obviously chain that hangs
down<00:00:56.690> like<00:00:58.479> like<00:00:59.479> it<00:00:59.809> can<00:01:00.019> go<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.379> can<00:01:00.500> be

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
down like like it can go you can be

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.079 
down like like it can go you can be
placed<00:01:00.830> on<00:01:01.010> top<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.250> each<00:01:01.280> other<00:01:01.400> it's<00:01:01.850> cool

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
placed on top of each other it's cool

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.630 
placed on top of each other it's cool
like<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:04.089> other<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.780> glass

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
like that and then other is the glass

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.190 
like that and then other is the glass
and<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.960> first<00:01:09.320> bug<00:01:09.590> i<00:01:09.770> will<00:01:09.950> show<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:10.850> is

another bug is if i went like works the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.840 
another bug is if i went like works the
reason<00:01:18.860> actually<00:01:18.979> plays<00:01:19.310> glass<00:01:19.579> errors

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
reason actually plays glass errors

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.480 
reason actually plays glass errors
because<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:20.780> issue<00:01:21.049> when<00:01:21.950> i<00:01:21.979> go<00:01:22.130> try<00:01:22.460> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
because of this issue when i go try and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.029 
because of this issue when i go try and
put<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.789> under<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.659> goes<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.079> wall<00:01:24.409> not<00:01:24.829> on

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
put it under it goes to the wall not on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.940 
put it under it goes to the wall not on
the<00:01:25.189> chain<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.000> put<00:01:26.149> glass<00:01:26.420> there

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the chain so you have to put glass there

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.170 
the chain so you have to put glass there

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
these are already grown that's why it's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.700

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
actually the mushrooms there's mushroom

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.840 
actually the mushrooms there's mushroom
spores<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:45.020> they<00:04:46.020> work<00:04:46.680> they<00:04:47.490> don't<00:04:47.670> work

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
spores and they work they don't work

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.210 
spores and they work they don't work
very<00:04:47.880> well<00:04:48.380> those<00:04:49.380> definitely<00:04:49.890> need<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.100> be

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
very well those definitely need to be

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.640 
very well those definitely need to be
fixed<00:04:50.700> I'm<00:04:51.180> not<00:04:51.420> sure<00:04:51.600> what's<00:04:51.900> exactly<00:04:52.380> wrong

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
fixed I'm not sure what's exactly wrong

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.760 
fixed I'm not sure what's exactly wrong
with<00:04:52.920> them<00:04:53.040> but<00:04:53.700> i<00:04:54.060> will<00:04:54.720> show<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.560> put

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
with them but i will show you if you put

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.020 
with them but i will show you if you put
like<00:04:55.980> two<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.520> row<00:04:56.550> side<00:04:57.330> by<00:04:57.480> side<00:04:57.890> of<00:04:59.030> wild

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
like two in a row side by side of wild

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.480 
like two in a row side by side of wild
course<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:00.660> usually<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:01.650> pop<00:05:02.040> over<00:05:02.370> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
course but usually they pop over the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.670 
course but usually they pop over the
ground<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:03.000> don't<00:05:03.810> know<00:05:03.870> these<00:05:04.050> probably<00:05:04.470> won't

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
ground I don't know these probably won't

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.710 
ground I don't know these probably won't
grow<00:05:04.950> because<00:05:05.190> every<00:05:05.940> single<00:05:06.300> time<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.480> I've

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
grow because every single time that I've

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.620 
grow because every single time that I've
done<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.200> try<00:05:07.470> quite<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:07.980> few<00:05:08.160> times<00:05:08.630> they

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
done it and I try quite a few times they

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.390 
done it and I try quite a few times they
don't<00:05:09.660> work<00:05:10.140> when<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.440> try<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:10.950> put<00:05:11.070> them<00:05:11.190> side

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
don't work when I try and put them side

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.960 
don't work when I try and put them side
by<00:05:11.430> side<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:12.090> don't<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.480> why<00:05:13.520> see<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:14.760> right

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
by side I don't know why see like right

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.330 
by side I don't know why see like right
here<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.450> don't<00:05:16.140> maybe<00:05:16.500> it's<00:05:16.710> just<00:05:16.800> by<00:05:17.040> water

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
here I don't maybe it's just by water

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.390 
here I don't maybe it's just by water
maybe<00:05:17.790> it's<00:05:17.970> not<00:05:18.090> supposed<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.450> be<00:05:18.510> by<00:05:18.690> water<00:05:18.960> I

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
doesn't work this is grass seed also you

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.850 
doesn't work this is grass seed also you
can<00:05:30.060> grow<00:05:30.210> grass<00:05:30.570> instantly<00:05:31.350> from<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.710> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
can grow grass instantly from it and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.700 
can grow grass instantly from it and
actually<00:05:32.610> just<00:05:33.030> good<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:34.080> get<00:05:34.260> those<00:05:34.410> seeds

by<00:05:34.980> um<00:05:35.450> just<00:05:36.450> plowing<00:05:36.840> like<00:05:37.230> if<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.500> got<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
by um just plowing like if I got the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.640 
by um just plowing like if I got the
whole<00:05:38.130> start<00:05:38.970> going<00:05:39.150> with<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.390> sea<00:05:40.260> grass

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
whole start going with this sea grass

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.740 
whole start going with this sea grass
seeds<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:41.790> then<00:05:42.090> you<00:05:42.180> get<00:05:42.270> all<00:05:42.420> different
