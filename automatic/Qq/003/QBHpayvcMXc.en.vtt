goes from there now the project was

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
goes from there now the project was
pretty<00:02:47.209> simple<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.630> make<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:47.840> make<00:02:48.230> sure<00:02:48.350> you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty simple to make but make sure you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.229 
pretty simple to make but make sure you
have<00:02:48.530> someone<00:02:48.739> who<00:02:48.950> knows<00:02:48.980> how<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.519> external

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.470 
about the LED lights basically you might
add<00:02:54.200> soldered<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.220> LEDs<00:02:55.579> together<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
add soldered all the LEDs together to a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.629 
add soldered all the LEDs together to a
battery<00:02:56.900> pack<00:02:57.139> with<00:02:57.470> an<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.920> off<00:02:57.980> switch

battery pack with an on and off switch
this<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.709> LED<00:03:01.780> vest

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
this is it this is the LED vest

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.400 
this is it this is the LED vest
this<00:03:03.139> is<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.889> sewed<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.609> velcro<00:03:05.450> that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410

this is it we sewed the velcro that
matches<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:07.069> fabric<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.200> that's<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.680> like

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
matches the fabric and that's just like

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.970 
matches the fabric and that's just like
a<00:03:09.859> t-shirt<00:03:10.190> without<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.510> teeth<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.620> added
