00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.430 
measurements here on my HTC evo 4g now
in<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.819> mean<00:02:37.390> pretty<00:02:37.629> much<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.959> found<00:02:38.170> is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
in I mean pretty much what I found is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.000 
in I mean pretty much what I found is
that<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.829> can<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.260> surface<00:02:41.500> area

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
that you can like just the surface area

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.250 
that you can like just the surface area
is<00:02:42.189> on<00:02:42.909> 5<00:02:43.269> inches<00:02:43.659> all<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:43.989> way<00:02:44.079> across

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
is on 5 inches all the way across

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.369 
is on 5 inches all the way across
diagonally<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.959> make<00:02:47.140> an<00:02:47.260> edge

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
diagonally so if you make an edge

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.530 
diagonally so if you make an edge
display<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.640> about<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.849> centimeter<00:02:49.389> on

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
display you get about a centimeter on

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.580 
display you get about a centimeter on
either<00:02:49.659> side<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.389> get<00:02:52.389> a<00:02:52.569> lot<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.930> room<00:02:53.230> down

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
either side you get a lot of room down

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.140 
either side you get a lot of room down
here<00:02:53.829> with<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> capacitive<00:02:54.459> controls<00:02:54.819> are<00:02:55.000> if

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
here with the capacitive controls are if

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.300 
here with the capacitive controls are if
you<00:02:55.269> replace<00:02:55.569> those<00:02:55.780> with<00:02:55.950> software<00:02:56.950> controls

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you replace those with software controls

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.199 
you replace those with software controls
and<00:02:58.109> even<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.379> move<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.709> speaker

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
and even you can move the speaker

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.300

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
quite a bit of room on top as well so

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.849 
quite a bit of room on top as well so
not<00:03:07.060> quite<00:03:07.420> enough<00:03:07.690> room<00:03:08.049> for<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> 5-inch

phone<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.859> 4-inch<00:03:27.430> display<00:03:27.639> so<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.329> that

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
phone it's a 4-inch display so if that

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.080 
phone it's a 4-inch display so if that
would<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.810> similar<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.500> size<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.090> it's

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
would be similar in size to the it's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.839 
would be similar in size to the it's

up you have an inch top bottom about a
centimeter<00:03:51.609> horizontally<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.790> more

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
centimeter horizontally so it's more

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.379

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
on there I personally I think that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.399 
on there I personally I think that
they'll<00:04:06.220> keep<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:07.540> body<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.989> phone<00:04:08.139> about

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
they'll keep the body of the phone about

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.710 
they'll keep the body of the phone about
this<00:04:08.709> big<00:04:08.919> I<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.909> last<00:04:10.150> year<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:12.720> it'll

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720

do<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.350> think<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:18.049> 1280<00:04:19.049> x<00:04:20.690> 600

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
do that I think it's like a 1280 x 600

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.000 
do that I think it's like a 1280 x 600
something<00:04:21.840> resolution<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:24.170> huge<00:04:25.170> resolution

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
something resolution so huge resolution
