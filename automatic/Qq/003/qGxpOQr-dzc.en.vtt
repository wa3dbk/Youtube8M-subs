 all right 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.470
 only one hour with 40 minutes was what 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.140
 that lasted the sale of tickets for the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.669

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 because we did not expect to be soldiers 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.460
 in 100 minutes the tickets are over 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.350
 it's something that makes us very happy 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.629
 motivates us to keep going because 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.370
 surely there are going to be more dates in 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.409

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.790

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.589
 that then we do not even have the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.140
 disk and have a sold-out of our 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.689
 first show then more impressive 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.009
 that we do not even have words to 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:04.930
 be able to explain that in 100 minutes there 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.850
 could sell everything and then the party is 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 to start 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 it started 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.120
 this concert that will be the first in your 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 career will have several surprises and they 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.530
 they tell us to dance because we are 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 very bad dancers but if we can 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 say that there will be a lot of partying it 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.470
 they are going to have a great time we are very involved 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.150
 in all production lighting everything 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 that so they stay just like 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 we want it to be and so that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.580
 I looked for them and they confessed to be 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 enormously grateful with their covers 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.120
 among those who also find their 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.010
 moms who still do not believe the success of their 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.270
 suckers do not serve super happy and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.400
 excited I think they are more than 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 we do not think so but good yes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.250
 I think that we are equal 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.250
