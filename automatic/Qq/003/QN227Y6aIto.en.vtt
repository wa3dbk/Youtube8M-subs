00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
i guess because i think that's one of

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.080 
i guess because i think that's one of
the<00:00:25.869> major<00:00:26.500> things<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:27.250> are<00:00:27.400> added<00:00:27.699> like

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
did a map wipe with that as well so this

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.509 
did a map wipe with that as well so this
is<00:01:00.699> gameplay<00:01:01.139> when<00:01:02.139> the<00:01:02.229> new<00:01:02.379> wipe<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:03.010> online

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
is gameplay when the new wipe was online

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.500 
is gameplay when the new wipe was online
nine<00:01:03.999> hours<00:01:04.540> after<00:01:05.049> basically<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.159> um<00:01:06.510> yeah

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
nine hours after basically so um yeah

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.420 
nine hours after basically so um yeah
i'll<00:01:07.659> start<00:01:07.960> by<00:01:08.020> talking<00:01:08.590> about<00:01:08.830> some<00:01:09.010> of<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
i'll start by talking about some of the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.790 
i'll start by talking about some of the
things<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.090> came<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.780> update<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.730> so

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
things that came with the update and so

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.980 
things that came with the update and so
all<00:01:14.800> building<00:01:15.460> parts<00:01:15.880> are<00:01:16.120> no<00:01:16.270> destroyable

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
all building parts are no destroyable

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.030 
all building parts are no destroyable
and<00:01:18.750> meaning<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:20.380> pretty<00:01:20.650> much<00:01:20.710> can

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
and meaning that you pretty much can

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.330 
and meaning that you pretty much can
raid<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.520> base<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.270> destroy<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.960> however<00:01:23.890> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
raid a base and destroy it however you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.730 
raid a base and destroy it however you
want<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.820> destroy<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.570> foundations<00:01:26.440> i'm

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
want you can destroy the foundations i'm

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.620 
want you can destroy the foundations i'm
guessing<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.550> don't<00:01:28.000> know<00:01:28.060> if<00:01:28.120> you<00:01:28.210> destroy<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
guessing I don't know if you destroy the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.750 
guessing I don't know if you destroy the
foundations<00:01:29.380> if<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.740> whole<00:01:29.890> building

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
foundations if the whole building

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.480 
foundations if the whole building
collapses<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.870> don't<00:01:32.050> think<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:32.710> because<00:01:33.220> that

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
collapses I don't think so because that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.790 
collapses I don't think so because that
is<00:01:33.580> probably<00:01:34.120> gonna<00:01:34.440> freakin<00:01:35.440> fly<00:01:35.650> or

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
is probably gonna freakin fly or

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.010 
is probably gonna freakin fly or
something<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.490> don't<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.480> think<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.840> that

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
something I don't know think of that

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.280 
something I don't know think of that
before<00:01:38.140> that's<00:01:38.890> fun<00:01:39.040> okay<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.840> yeah<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.230> you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
before that's fun okay but yeah so you

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.620 
before that's fun okay but yeah so you
you<00:01:41.650> destroy<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> wall<00:01:42.730> for<00:01:42.970> sample<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.510> it's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
you destroy a wall for sample and it's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.600 
you destroy a wall for sample and it's
gonna<00:01:43.720> get<00:01:44.080> darker<00:01:44.710> than<00:01:44.860> where<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.190> destroy

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
gonna get darker than where you destroy

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.460 
gonna get darker than where you destroy
it<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:46.000> when<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:46.390> really<00:01:46.750> dark<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.320> guess

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it so when it's really dark I guess

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.340 
it so when it's really dark I guess
you're<00:01:47.650> gonna<00:01:47.740> know<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.220> soon<00:01:48.850> broken<00:01:49.360> yeah

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
you're gonna know that soon broken yeah

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.680 
you're gonna know that soon broken yeah
that's<00:01:50.740> how<00:01:50.890> they<00:01:51.040> wrote<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.400> at<00:01:51.730> least<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.450> um

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
that's how they wrote it at least so um

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's how they wrote it at least so um
yeah<00:01:53.380> they're<00:01:53.560> also<00:01:53.740> made<00:01:54.310> metal<00:01:54.700> doors

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
yeah they're also made metal doors

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.940 
yeah they're also made metal doors
significantly<00:01:55.840> harder<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.560> croft<00:01:56.950> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
significantly harder to croft and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.170 
significantly harder to croft and
meanings<00:01:59.950> gonna<00:02:00.130> be<00:02:00.250> harder<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.580> defend<00:02:00.970> your

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
meanings gonna be harder to defend your

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.520 
meanings gonna be harder to defend your
base<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.810> set<00:02:02.560> up<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.860> fortress<00:02:03.430> i<00:02:03.700> guess<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.530> i

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
base and set up a fortress i guess and i

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.440 
base and set up a fortress i guess and i
noticed<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.010> pattern<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:06.729> update<00:02:06.970> they

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
noticed a pattern in this update they

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.259 
noticed a pattern in this update they
made<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:08.289> defending<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.399> your<00:02:09.580> base<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:10.149> lot

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
made the defending of your base a lot

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.410 
made the defending of your base a lot
harder<00:02:10.659> and<00:02:11.140> rating<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.129> other<00:02:12.280> basis<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:13.120> lot

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
harder and rating of other basis a lot

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.470 
harder and rating of other basis a lot
easier

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
easier

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.290 
easier
because<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.019> on<00:02:17.230> these<00:02:18.300> things

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
because you can see that on these things

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.000 
because you can see that on these things
that<00:02:19.390> I'm<00:02:19.540> telling<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.840> right<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that I'm telling you right now and the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.080 
that I'm telling you right now and the
next<00:02:21.129> thing<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:22.690> explosive<00:02:23.680> charge<00:02:24.519> item

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
next thing is that explosive charge item

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
next thing is that explosive charge item
that's<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:25.720> they<00:02:25.840> wrote<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.709> guess<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
that's what they wrote and I guess you

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.250 
that's what they wrote and I guess you
could<00:02:27.040> call<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.400> c4<00:02:28.000> or<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> satchel<00:02:28.870> charge

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
could call it a c4 or a satchel charge

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.190 
could call it a c4 or a satchel charge
something<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.280> which<00:02:31.090> would<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.750> good

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
something like that which would be good

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
something like that which would be good
to<00:02:32.379> place<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.769> an<00:02:32.860> iron<00:02:33.010> door<00:02:33.400> instead<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.090> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to place on an iron door instead of I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.259 
to place on an iron door instead of I
mean<00:02:35.379> that's<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.799> guess<00:02:35.950> that's<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.430> fixed<00:02:36.849> to

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
mean that's I guess that's a fixed to

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.050 
mean that's I guess that's a fixed to
the<00:02:37.299> ramps<00:02:38.170> being<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.370> front<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.760> iron

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
the ramps being in in front of the iron

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.960 
the ramps being in in front of the iron
doors<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.569> grenades<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.290> bounces<00:02:41.739> off

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
doors so the grenades just bounces off

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.000 
doors so the grenades just bounces off
so<00:02:42.970> that's<00:02:43.120> good<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.650> they've<00:02:44.650> also<00:02:44.830> made

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
so that's good and they've also made

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.490 
so that's good and they've also made
grenades<00:02:45.580> slightly<00:02:46.450> easier<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.989> Croft

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
grenades slightly easier to Croft

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.920 
grenades slightly easier to Croft
meaning<00:02:48.190> easier<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.000> read<00:02:49.150> basis<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.840> it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
meaning easier to read basis and it's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.600 
meaning easier to read basis and it's
drier<00:02:50.260> indoors<00:02:50.680> with<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:54.069> also<00:02:54.190> made

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
drier indoors with that and it also made

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.630 
drier indoors with that and it also made
them<00:02:55.590> something<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.620> they<00:02:56.769> call<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.010> corpse

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
them something that they call a corpse

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.270 
them something that they call a corpse
which<00:02:58.120> will<00:02:58.329> draw<00:02:58.599> under<00:02:59.260> an<00:02:59.410> iron<00:02:59.590> door<00:02:59.890> or<00:03:00.220> a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
which will draw under an iron door or a

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.569 
which will draw under an iron door or a
window<00:03:00.849> as<00:03:01.599> well<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.930> think<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.220> destroy

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
window as well I think if you destroy

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.270 
window as well I think if you destroy
the<00:03:03.610> door<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.239> will<00:03:04.720> drop<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> corpse<00:03:05.709> quote

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
the door I will drop a corpse quote

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.479 
the door I will drop a corpse quote
unquote<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.709> which<00:03:08.709> will<00:03:08.890> last<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.310> five

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
unquote and which will last for five

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.280 
unquote and which will last for five
minutes<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.599> cannot<00:03:10.780> build<00:03:11.019> another

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
minutes and you cannot build another

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.410 
minutes and you cannot build another
door<00:03:11.590> on<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.920> corpse<00:03:12.310> for<00:03:12.879> those<00:03:13.060> five

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
door on the corpse for those five

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.839 
door on the corpse for those five
minutes<00:03:13.750> then<00:03:14.069> meaning<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.160> will<00:03:15.280> be<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.610> lot

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
minutes then meaning it will be a lot

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.119 
minutes then meaning it will be a lot
harder<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.629> defend<00:03:17.019> your<00:03:17.260> base<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.799> place

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
harder to defend your base and place

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.190 
harder to defend your base and place
another<00:03:18.160> iron<00:03:18.790> door<00:03:19.030> if<00:03:19.239> anyone<00:03:19.540> breaks<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:20.049> or

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
another iron door if anyone breaks in or

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.610 
another iron door if anyone breaks in or
something<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:22.750> also<00:03:22.900> may

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
something like that and and it also may

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.990 
something like that and and it also may
finally<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.970> gay<00:03:25.690> give<00:03:26.109> sorry<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.459> i<00:03:27.670> also

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
finally a gay give sorry if i also

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.690 
finally a gay give sorry if i also
finally<00:03:28.329> gave<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.049> sleeping<00:03:29.980> bag<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.370> cool

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
finally gave the sleeping bag a cool

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.120 
finally gave the sleeping bag a cool
down<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.180> four<00:03:31.480> minutes<00:03:31.810> meaning<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.799> will<00:03:32.950> be

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
down on four minutes meaning it will be

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.680 
down on four minutes meaning it will be
a<00:03:33.160> lot<00:03:33.370> harder<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.910> defend<00:03:34.090> your<00:03:34.239> base<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.599> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
a lot harder to defend your base in that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.569 
a lot harder to defend your base in that
way<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.109> well<00:03:35.139> it<00:03:35.470> will<00:03:35.500> probably<00:03:36.250> destroy

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
way as well it will probably destroy

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.940 
way as well it will probably destroy
your<00:03:36.940> sleeping<00:03:37.389> bag<00:03:37.540> before<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.900> can<00:03:38.139> be<00:03:38.769> able

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
your sleeping bag before you can be able

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.979 
your sleeping bag before you can be able
to<00:03:39.069> spawn<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.670> there<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.239> probably<00:03:40.750> just

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
to spawn on there so you probably just

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.330 
to spawn on there so you probably just
gonna<00:03:41.079> have<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.380> spawn<00:03:43.560> spawn<00:03:44.560> randomly<00:03:44.799> right

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
gonna have to spawn spawn randomly right

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
gonna have to spawn spawn randomly right
away<00:03:45.609> actually<00:03:45.880> if<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.389> get<00:03:46.569> your<00:03:46.780> base<00:03:47.319> rated

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
away actually if you get your base rated

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.599 
away actually if you get your base rated
yeah<00:03:49.900> that's<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.410> thing<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.889> base

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
yeah that's the thing with a base

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.180 
yeah that's the thing with a base
defending<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.359> stuff<00:03:52.569> i<00:03:52.720> guess<00:03:52.959> so<00:03:53.560> this<00:03:53.769> next

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
defending and stuff i guess so this next

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.680 
defending and stuff i guess so this next
thing<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.849> like<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.599> said<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.079> radiation<00:03:56.680> suit

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
thing is like I said the radiation suit

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.360 
thing is like I said the radiation suit
which<00:03:58.690> will<00:03:59.019> help<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.769> get<00:03:59.889> rid<00:04:00.069> of<00:04:00.130> some

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
which will help you get rid of some

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.879 
which will help you get rid of some
radiation<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:01.389> guess<00:04:01.599> when<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.500> go<00:04:02.590> into<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
radiation I guess when you go into the

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.530 
radiation I guess when you go into the
towns<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.609> also<00:04:03.760> notice<00:04:04.180> during<00:04:04.359> the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
towns and I also notice during the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.530 
towns and I also notice during the
gameplay<00:04:04.720> here<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.980> if<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:06.609> go<00:04:06.700> into<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:07.000> town

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
gameplay here that if you go into a town

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.650 
gameplay here that if you go into a town
or<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.579> facility<00:04:09.579> or<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:09.730> factory<00:04:10.239> or<00:04:10.269> whatever

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
or a facility or a factory or whatever

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.589 
or a facility or a factory or whatever
like<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:12.519> will<00:04:12.609> notice<00:04:12.819> that<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.480> a

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
like that you will notice that it's a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.560 
like that you will notice that it's a
lot<00:04:13.780> more<00:04:14.139> radiation<00:04:14.889> levels<00:04:15.760> over<00:04:16.359> there<00:04:16.539> I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
lot more radiation levels over there I

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.390 
lot more radiation levels over there I
actually<00:04:16.959> got<00:04:17.289> thousand<00:04:17.739> radiation<00:04:18.280> from

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
actually got thousand radiation from

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.219 
actually got thousand radiation from
this<00:04:18.609> running<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.150> trying<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.750> get<00:04:19.870> some<00:04:20.049> loot

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
this running in trying to get some loot

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.469 
this running in trying to get some loot
and<00:04:20.410> then<00:04:20.530> running<00:04:20.680> out<00:04:20.889> so<00:04:20.919> i<00:04:21.220> guess<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:22.300> to

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
and then running out so i guess that to

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.940 
and then running out so i guess that to
be<00:04:22.599> able<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.930> go<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.229> there<00:04:23.409> and<00:04:23.530> get<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.800> loads

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
be able to go in there and get the loads

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.600 
be able to go in there and get the loads
you're<00:04:24.159> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> need<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.580> british

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
you're going to need a british

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.290 
you're going to need a british
or<00:04:25.699> a<00:04:25.759> lot<00:04:26.389> of<00:04:26.509> medikits<00:04:27.520> because<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.639> used<00:04:28.849> two

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
or a lot of medikits because I used two

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.149 
or a lot of medikits because I used two
or<00:04:29.449> three<00:04:29.659> medikits<00:04:30.020> going<00:04:30.409> in<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.740> out<00:04:30.830> there

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
or three medikits going in and out there

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.850 
or three medikits going in and out there
but<00:04:32.060> actually<00:04:32.330> got<00:04:32.449> a<00:04:32.479> holo<00:04:32.719> sight<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.349> I<00:04:33.560> guess

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
but actually got a holo sight so I guess

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.909 
but actually got a holo sight so I guess
that's<00:04:34.129> worth<00:04:34.819> it<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:38.620> Geiger<00:04:39.620> meter

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
that's worth it and the Geiger meter

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.629 
that's worth it and the Geiger meter
sound<00:04:40.430> effects<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.629> whatever<00:04:42.229> when<00:04:43.159> you<00:04:43.250> wanna

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
sound effects or whatever when you wanna

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.869 
sound effects or whatever when you wanna
hear<00:04:43.789> radiation<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.900> sound<00:04:45.289> like<00:04:45.879> the

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
hear radiation that sound like the

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.670 
hear radiation that sound like the
clicking<00:04:47.240> sound<00:04:47.270> or<00:04:47.629> whatever<00:04:47.930> you'll<00:04:48.409> still

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
clicking sound or whatever you'll still

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.980 
clicking sound or whatever you'll still
hear<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:48.949> when<00:04:49.939> there<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.180> radiation<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:50.870> you

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
hear that when there is radiation so you

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290 
hear that when there is radiation so you
know<00:04:51.169> when<00:04:51.319> there's<00:04:52.219> radiation<00:04:52.639> around<00:04:52.969> you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
know when there's radiation around you

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.110 
know when there's radiation around you
when<00:04:53.509> you<00:04:53.629> have<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.710> radiation<00:04:55.159> suit<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.789> you

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
when you have the radiation suit on you

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.459 
when you have the radiation suit on you
equipped<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.449> screen<00:04:59.689> flickering

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
equipped and but the screen flickering

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.369 
equipped and but the screen flickering
and<00:05:00.650> stuff<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.539> get<00:05:02.539> a<00:05:02.569> noise<00:05:02.779> on<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> screen

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
and stuff the get a noise on the screen

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.219 
and stuff the get a noise on the screen
or<00:05:03.590> whatever<00:05:03.969> will<00:05:04.969> be<00:05:05.180> less<00:05:05.509> noticeable<00:05:05.719> it

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
or whatever will be less noticeable it

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.300 
or whatever will be less noticeable it
will<00:05:06.409> be<00:05:06.529> a<00:05:07.150> smaller<00:05:08.150> effect<00:05:08.509> on<00:05:08.779> the<00:05:08.930> screen

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
will be a smaller effect on the screen

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.390 
will be a smaller effect on the screen
so<00:05:10.629> now<00:05:11.629> to<00:05:11.689> some<00:05:12.050> smaller<00:05:12.409> things<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.009> update

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
so now to some smaller things and update

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.339 
so now to some smaller things and update
they've<00:05:13.699> had<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:13.849> kevlar<00:05:14.360> pants<00:05:14.689> and<00:05:15.050> shoes

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
they've had a kevlar pants and shoes

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.119 
they've had a kevlar pants and shoes
which<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.460> guess<00:05:16.729> it's<00:05:17.060> pretty<00:05:17.659> good<00:05:18.099> armor<00:05:19.099> I

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
which I guess it's pretty good armor I

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.959 
which I guess it's pretty good armor I
think<00:05:19.550> it's<00:05:19.669> pretty<00:05:19.819> good<00:05:20.029> armor<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:21.849> you<00:05:22.849> can

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
think it's pretty good armor and you can

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.689 
think it's pretty good armor and you can
no<00:05:23.479> longer<00:05:23.750> stack<00:05:24.169> with<00:05:24.409> storage<00:05:25.009> boxes<00:05:25.520> as

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
no longer stack with storage boxes as

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.670 
no longer stack with storage boxes as
well<00:05:25.849> on<00:05:26.029> top<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.330> each<00:05:26.449> other<00:05:26.569> and<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.590> that's

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
well on top of each other and so that's

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.010 
well on top of each other and so that's
gonna<00:05:27.860> make<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.240> towers<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.270> lot<00:05:29.599> harder<00:05:29.870> I

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
gonna make the towers a lot harder I

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.089 
gonna make the towers a lot harder I
guess<00:05:30.259> because<00:05:31.300> I've<00:05:32.300> seen<00:05:32.440> players<00:05:33.440> building

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
guess because I've seen players building

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.399 
guess because I've seen players building
up<00:05:34.250> with<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.789> wooden<00:05:35.180> storage<00:05:35.449> boxes<00:05:36.080> and

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
up with the wooden storage boxes and

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.149 
up with the wooden storage boxes and
just<00:05:37.039> building<00:05:37.699> up<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:38.150> huge<00:05:39.050> Tower<00:05:39.469> and<00:05:39.710> on<00:05:39.889> top

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
just building up a huge Tower and on top

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.420 
just building up a huge Tower and on top
of<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.400> building<00:05:40.879> a<00:05:41.360> foundation<00:05:42.139> and<00:05:42.889> I'm

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
of that building a foundation and I'm

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.430 
of that building a foundation and I'm
building<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:43.849> house<00:05:44.029> on<00:05:44.300> top<00:05:44.479> of<00:05:44.690> there<00:05:44.900> which

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
building a house on top of there which

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.980 
building a house on top of there which
is<00:05:45.620> pretty<00:05:46.430> freaking<00:05:47.240> ridiculous<00:05:47.360> if<00:05:47.870> you<00:05:47.900> ask

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
is pretty freaking ridiculous if you ask

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.980 
is pretty freaking ridiculous if you ask
me<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:49.490> I've<00:05:49.669> also<00:05:49.759> done<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:50.509> that<00:05:50.659> you<00:05:50.779> can't

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
me and I've also done so that you can't

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.350 
me and I've also done so that you can't
place<00:05:51.229> foundations<00:05:51.949> on<00:05:52.250> anything<00:05:52.729> other<00:05:53.000> than

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
place foundations on anything other than

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.839 
place foundations on anything other than
what<00:05:53.900> is<00:05:54.500> called<00:05:54.710> terrain<00:05:55.099> I<00:05:55.400> think<00:05:55.669> they

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
what is called terrain I think they

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.600 
what is called terrain I think they
wrote<00:05:56.330> yeah<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:57.199> can't<00:05:57.860> place<00:05:58.069> finishing

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
wrote yeah I can't place finishing

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.369 
wrote yeah I can't place finishing
foundations<00:05:59.389> on<00:05:59.599> anything<00:05:59.870> other<00:06:00.139> than

winning<00:06:02.870> storage<00:06:03.169> boxes<00:06:03.620> I<00:06:03.830> guess<00:06:04.430> and

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
winning storage boxes I guess and

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.260 
winning storage boxes I guess and
barricades<00:06:06.889> are<00:06:07.099> no<00:06:07.279> higher<00:06:07.550> as<00:06:07.789> well<00:06:08.000> so<00:06:08.180> you

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
barricades are no higher as well so you

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.959 
barricades are no higher as well so you
can't<00:06:08.509> jump<00:06:08.750> over<00:06:08.930> them<00:06:09.289> that's<00:06:09.759> that's<00:06:10.759> good

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
can't jump over them that's that's good

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.890 
can't jump over them that's that's good
I<00:06:11.000> guess<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.860> it's<00:06:13.789> also<00:06:13.969> easier<00:06:14.569> to<00:06:14.629> play

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
I guess and it's also easier to play

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.950 
I guess and it's also easier to play
ceilings<00:06:15.729> if<00:06:16.729> you're<00:06:16.909> standing<00:06:17.150> under<00:06:17.810> the

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
ceilings if you're standing under the

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.149 
ceilings if you're standing under the
spot<00:06:18.169> you're<00:06:18.199> going<00:06:18.469> to<00:06:18.560> place<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.830> ceiling

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
spot you're going to place the ceiling

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.379 
spot you're going to place the ceiling
in<00:06:19.279> it<00:06:19.400> because<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:19.729> noticed<00:06:20.060> that<00:06:20.120> it's

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
in it because I noticed that it's

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.730 
in it because I noticed that it's
actually<00:06:20.839> pretty<00:06:20.930> hard<00:06:21.199> to<00:06:21.349> place<00:06:21.560> the

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
actually pretty hard to place the

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.070 
actually pretty hard to place the

ceiling you have to get exactly the
right<00:06:24.199> spot<00:06:24.500> able<00:06:25.089> to<00:06:26.089> place<00:06:26.629> the<00:06:26.810> ceiling

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
right spot able to place the ceiling

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.829 
right spot able to place the ceiling

hill stay not that steep hill but on a
hill<00:06:33.319> and<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:35.180> was<00:06:35.479> trying<00:06:35.719> to<00:06:35.779> place<00:06:36.020> my

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
and yeah it didn't work so I was kind of

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.620 
and yeah it didn't work so I was kind of
exposed<00:06:43.040> their<00:06:43.310> players<00:06:43.670> were<00:06:43.910> coming<00:06:44.330> trying
