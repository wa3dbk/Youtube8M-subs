00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of the reflection and again it's not

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
of the reflection and again it's not
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> show<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:29.970> until<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.660> something

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
going to show up until we get something

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.799 
going to show up until we get something
else<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.439> there<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> where<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> get

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
else on there and this is where you get

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
else on there and this is where you get
to<00:00:33.989> play<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.190> happens<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to play you get to see what happens if I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
to play you get to see what happens if I
do<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.530> happens<00:00:37.920> if

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
do this or if I do that what happens if

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.369 
do this or if I do that what happens if
I<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.700> lighten<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> sky<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I really lighten up the sky I make the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.970 
I really lighten up the sky I make the
sky<00:00:40.620> lighter<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sky lighter than it is here what will it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
sky lighter than it is here what will it
look<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> painting<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.960> really

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
look like because the painting is really

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
look like because the painting is really
all<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.620> relationships<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
all these relationships it's a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
all these relationships it's a
relationship<00:00:48.300> between<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.840> shape<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
relationship between this shape that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
relationship between this shape that
shape<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.129> shape<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.579> shade<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> shape

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
shape this shape that shade that shape

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
shape this shape that shade that shape
so<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.629> they're<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.870> working<00:00:52.140> together

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so if they're not working together

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000 
so if they're not working together
it's<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.629> paintings<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> work<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's the paintings not going to work so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
it's the paintings not going to work so
I'm<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> lighten<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> sky<00:00:57.149> let's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I'm going to lighten up the sky let's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.549 
I'm going to lighten up the sky let's
see<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> change<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
see what that change in that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.220 
see what that change in that
relationship<00:00:59.280> does<00:00:59.570> now<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> lighter

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
right here this would that would make

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.090

doing doing this and playing with it two

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.840 
doing doing this and playing with it two
three<00:03:32.870> times<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.560> can<00:03:34.100> lighten<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.549> sky<00:03:34.820> a

three times I can lighten the sky a
little<00:03:35.030> bit<00:03:35.239> more<00:03:35.480> what<00:03:35.720> happens<00:03:36.049> if<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
little bit more what happens if I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.420 
little bit more what happens if I
lighten<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> building<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.100> think<00:03:37.160> the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
much better this one is than this one

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.539 
much better this one is than this one
with<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.930> house<00:04:18.140> being<00:04:18.500> darker<00:04:18.979> with<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
grass being a little bit lighter so you

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.650 
grass being a little bit lighter so you
can<00:04:21.859> work<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.310> all<00:04:22.430> out<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.970> black<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.479> white

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
can work it all out in black and white

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.120 
can work it all out in black and white
you<00:04:23.990> can

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
you can

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.130 
you can
so<00:04:25.250> take<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> shot<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.850> your<00:04:26.120> painting<00:04:26.570> or<00:04:26.690> of

so take a shot of your painting or of
whatever's<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.040> color<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.150> could

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
whatever's in color and you could

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.220 
whatever's in color and you could
Photoshop<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:30.920> take<00:04:31.130> all<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
Photoshop it you can take all the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.600 
Photoshop it you can take all the
saturation<00:04:33.230> out<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.860> take<00:04:34.010> all<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.370> color

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
saturation out of it take all the color

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.850 
saturation out of it take all the color
up<00:04:34.850> out<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.110> Windows<00:04:36.440> program<00:04:36.830> I

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
up out of it in the Windows program I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.500 
up out of it in the Windows program I
think<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.340> can<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.760> in<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.970> Windows<00:04:38.270> photo

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
think you can do it in the Windows photo

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.250 
think you can do it in the Windows photo
editor<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.140> also<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.670> Photoshop<00:04:41.420> take

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
editor and also in the Photoshop take

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.050 
editor and also in the Photoshop take
all<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.650> color<00:04:42.890> out<00:04:43.010> of<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.490> turn<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.910> into

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
all the color out of it turn it into

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.960 
all the color out of it turn it into
black-and-white<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.050> squint<00:04:45.920> at<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> see

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
black-and-white and squint at it and see

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.820 
black-and-white and squint at it and see
which<00:04:47.330> one<00:04:47.600> looks<00:04:47.630> better<00:04:48.110> you'll<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.560> able<00:04:48.680> to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
which one looks better you'll be able to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.740 
which one looks better you'll be able to
see<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.040> think<00:04:49.220> if<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.640> just<00:04:49.670> squint<00:04:50.090> now<00:04:50.330> you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
see I think if you just squint now you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.270 
see I think if you just squint now you
can<00:04:50.900> see<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.290> this<00:04:51.410> one<00:04:51.620> looks<00:04:51.830> better<00:04:52.010> than

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
can see that this one looks better than

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.780 
can see that this one looks better than
that<00:04:52.460> one

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
that one

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.230 
that one
so<00:04:53.120> then<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.110> paint<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:54.800> way<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.940> paint

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
so then you paint it this way you paint

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.880 
so then you paint it this way you paint
it<00:04:56.360> with<00:04:56.450> this<00:04:56.660> in<00:04:56.840> mind<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.500> values

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
it with this in mind that the values

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.530 
it with this in mind that the values
have<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.250> be<00:04:58.280> like<00:04:58.580> whichever<00:04:58.970> one<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.390> could

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
have to be like whichever one you could

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.540 
have to be like whichever one you could
do<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.750> four<00:04:59.990> times<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.590> maybe<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.370> do

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
do it four times and maybe you do

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.490 
do it four times and maybe you do
another<00:05:01.850> one<00:05:01.970> down<00:05:02.270> here<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.840> looks<00:05:03.290> even

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
another one down here that looks even

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.620 
another one down here that looks even
better<00:05:03.800> than<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:04.520> play<00:05:05.000> around<00:05:05.270> with<00:05:05.480> it

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
better than that one play around with it

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.360 
better than that one play around with it
see<00:05:05.810> what<00:05:05.840> what<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.620> change<00:05:06.920> maybe<00:05:07.190> you

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
see what what you change maybe you

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.780 
see what what you change maybe you
change<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.880> sky<00:05:08.120> maybe<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:08.960> change<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.470> bush

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
change the sky maybe you change the bush

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.010 
change the sky maybe you change the bush
whatever<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.060> change<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.600> do<00:05:11.690> four<00:05:11.990> of

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
whatever and change it and do four of

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.540 
whatever and change it and do four of
and<00:05:12.350> pick<00:05:12.530> out<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.830> one<00:05:12.980> that<00:05:13.100> works<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.520> best

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
and pick out the one that works the best

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.970 
and pick out the one that works the best
then<00:05:14.240> run<00:05:14.660> with<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.990> on<00:05:15.200> your<00:05:15.380> big<00:05:15.530> painting
