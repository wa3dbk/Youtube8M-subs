kind of an embarrassing story the last
couple<00:00:30.230> of<00:00:30.470> trips<00:00:30.740> out<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.250> field<00:00:31.519> I

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
couple of trips out to the field I

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.520 
couple of trips out to the field I
couldn't<00:00:32.000> get<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.239> 900<00:00:32.750> megahertz<00:00:32.989> system

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
couldn't get that 900 megahertz system

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.700 
couldn't get that 900 megahertz system
to<00:00:33.680> work<00:00:34.780> more<00:00:35.780> than<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:36.820> few<00:00:37.820> hundred<00:00:37.879> feet<00:00:38.330> and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
to work more than a few hundred feet and

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.410 
to work more than a few hundred feet and
come<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.769> find<00:00:39.860> out<00:00:40.280> after<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:40.790> ordered<00:00:41.089> a<00:00:41.390> new

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
come to find out after I ordered a new

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.170 
come to find out after I ordered a new
one<00:00:42.110> point<00:00:42.559> two<00:00:42.739> gigahertz<00:00:43.040> law<00:00:43.430> made<00:00:43.670> system

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
one point two gigahertz law made system

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.960 
one point two gigahertz law made system
because<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:44.659> one<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.140> thought<00:00:45.350> was<00:00:45.500> junk<00:00:45.970> I

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
because this one I thought was junk I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.460 
because this one I thought was junk I
figured<00:00:47.809> out<00:00:47.930> what<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.379> problem<00:00:48.559> was<00:00:50.470> SMA

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
figured out what the problem was SMA

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.160 
figured out what the problem was SMA
connector<00:00:51.949> on<00:00:52.159> here<00:00:52.670> SMA<00:00:53.239> connector<00:00:53.659> on<00:00:53.780> here

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
connector on here SMA connector on here

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.160 
connector on here SMA connector on here
my<00:00:54.710> cable<00:00:55.129> had<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.729> female<00:00:56.150> on<00:00:56.299> both<00:00:56.540> sides<00:00:56.869> so

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
my cable had the female on both sides so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.280 
my cable had the female on both sides so
I<00:00:57.199> have<00:00:57.379> no<00:00:57.500> pen<00:00:58.239> connecting<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.360> two<00:00:59.570> active

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
I have no pen connecting the two active

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.740 
I have no pen connecting the two active
element<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.670> feel<00:01:01.850> kind<00:01:02.059> of<00:01:02.119> stupid<00:01:02.420> about

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
element so feel kind of stupid about

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.380 
element so feel kind of stupid about
that<00:01:03.049> but<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:05.449> works<00:01:05.840> again<00:01:06.500> too<00:01:06.890> I'm<00:01:07.610> glad<00:01:08.360> I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
that but it works again too I'm glad I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.330 
that but it works again too I'm glad I
didn't<00:01:08.630> burn<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.020> transmitter<00:01:09.770> up<00:01:09.980> because

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
didn't burn that transmitter up because

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.530 
didn't burn that transmitter up because
I<00:01:10.460> believe<00:01:10.730> you're<00:01:10.880> not<00:01:11.000> supposed<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.300> run

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
I believe you're not supposed to run

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.240 
I believe you're not supposed to run
those<00:01:11.690> without<00:01:11.900> an<00:01:12.170> antenna<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.740> there<00:01:13.070> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
those without an antenna on there and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.160 
those without an antenna on there and
that's<00:01:14.120> pretty<00:01:14.450> much<00:01:14.570> what<00:01:14.840> i've<00:01:14.960> been<00:01:14.990> doing

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
that's pretty much what i've been doing

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.500 
that's pretty much what i've been doing
so<00:01:15.890> anyway<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.670> went<00:01:16.760> ahead<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.030> put<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.240> on

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
so anyway I went ahead and put that on

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.040 
so anyway I went ahead and put that on
here<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.710> I've<00:01:19.580> got<00:01:19.790> my<00:01:20.150> circular<00:01:20.600> polarized

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
here and I've got my circular polarized

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.440 
here and I've got my circular polarized
antenna<00:01:22.450> mounted<00:01:23.450> right<00:01:23.690> there<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:25.450> 800

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
antenna mounted right there and 800

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.430 
antenna mounted right there and 800
milliwatts<00:01:26.780> transmitter<00:01:27.910> now<00:01:28.910> for<00:01:29.540> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
milliwatts transmitter now for the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.300 
milliwatts transmitter now for the
equipment<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.220> made<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.060> fuselage<00:01:32.860> out<00:01:33.860> of<00:01:34.159> some

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
equipment I made a fuselage out of some

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.830 
equipment I made a fuselage out of some
packing<00:01:35.060> foam<00:01:35.240> here<00:01:35.950> some<00:01:36.950> very<00:01:37.190> light<00:01:38.090> dense

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
packing foam here some very light dense

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.310

soft<00:01:39.530> packing<00:01:40.100> foam<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.390> got<00:01:41.510> my<00:01:41.630> GoPro<00:01:42.050> on

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
soft packing foam and I got my GoPro on

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.170 
soft packing foam and I got my GoPro on
the<00:01:42.560> front<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:43.550> going<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:43.970> this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
the front and I'm going to be using this

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.310 
the front and I'm going to be using this
as<00:01:44.360> an<00:01:44.450> fpd<00:01:44.930> camera<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.500> for<00:01:45.740> HD<00:01:46.130> recording<00:01:46.640> I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
as an fpd camera and for HD recording I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.590 
as an fpd camera and for HD recording I
set<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.470> up<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.710> one<00:01:49.159> battery<00:01:49.610> 13<00:01:50.120> thousand

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
set this up for one battery 13 thousand

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.620 
set this up for one battery 13 thousand
milliamp<00:01:50.870> hour<00:01:51.140> battery<00:01:52.150> which<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.180> those

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
milliamp hour battery which is those

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.250 
milliamp hour battery which is those
right<00:01:53.870> here<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:55.370> some<00:01:55.960> area<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.020> can

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
right here and I have some area I can

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.560 
right here and I have some area I can
cut<00:01:57.530> out<00:01:57.680> here<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.280> move<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.610> forwards<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
cut out here to move it forwards and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.750 
cut out here to move it forwards and
backwards<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:01.010> adjust<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.400> center<00:02:01.729> of

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
backwards to adjust the center of

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.820 
backwards to adjust the center of
gravity<00:02:02.330> but<00:02:03.110> I'm<00:02:03.200> lay<00:02:03.380> all<00:02:03.560> my<00:02:03.590> electronics

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
gravity but I'm lay all my electronics

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.700 
gravity but I'm lay all my electronics
out<00:02:04.400> pretty<00:02:05.060> well<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.659> CG<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.049> pretty<00:02:06.560> much

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
out pretty well so the CG is pretty much

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.999 
out pretty well so the CG is pretty much
right<00:02:07.010> on<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:08.479> my<00:02:08.690> 30th<00:02:09.319> speed<00:02:09.619> controller

prop<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.340> was<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.240> little<00:02:23.570> bit<00:02:23.690> concerned<00:02:23.840> about

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
prop I was a little bit concerned about

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.930 
prop I was a little bit concerned about
how<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.920> was<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.280> work<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.910> I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
how that was going to work on here I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.450 
how that was going to work on here I
haven't<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:26.420> an<00:02:26.510> amp<00:02:26.720> meter<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.290> yet<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.400> I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
haven't put an amp meter on it yet but I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.520 
haven't put an amp meter on it yet but I
get<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> ton<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.150> thrust<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.840> mean<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.140> has<00:02:30.320> got

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
get a ton of thrust I mean this has got

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.170 
get a ton of thrust I mean this has got
some<00:02:30.740> serious<00:02:30.770> going<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:31.880> serious

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
some serious going to have some serious

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.320 
some serious going to have some serious
vertical<00:02:32.600> climb<00:02:33.580> I'm<00:02:34.580> thinking<00:02:34.850> about<00:02:35.120> going

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
vertical climb I'm thinking about going

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.860 
vertical climb I'm thinking about going
ahead<00:02:35.480> going<00:02:36.260> maybe<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> 10-inch<00:02:37.100> prop

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
ahead going maybe to a 10-inch prop

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.640 
ahead going maybe to a 10-inch prop
because<00:02:38.870> that's<00:02:39.050> going<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.260> be<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> milli<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
because that's going to be a milli a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.900 
because that's going to be a milli a
little<00:02:39.860> bit<00:02:39.950> too<00:02:40.130> much<00:02:40.280> I'd<00:02:40.430> rather<00:02:40.460> have<00:02:40.880> a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
little bit too much I'd rather have a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.510 
little bit too much I'd rather have a
little<00:02:41.150> more<00:02:41.300> efficiency<00:02:41.990> than<00:02:42.440> thrust<00:02:42.950> so

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
little more efficiency than thrust so

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.870 
little more efficiency than thrust so
we'll<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:44.500> what<00:02:45.500> else<00:02:45.710> I've<00:02:45.980> got<00:02:46.160> my<00:02:46.370> Hornet

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
we'll see what else I've got my Hornet

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.310 
we'll see what else I've got my Hornet

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
receiver and I'll cover that up I failed

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.030 
receiver and I'll cover that up I failed
in<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.970> original<00:03:13.970> battery<00:03:14.540> bay<00:03:15.020> right<00:03:15.740> there

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
in that original battery bay right there

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.420 
in that original battery bay right there
with<00:03:16.190> foam<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:17.770> left<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.950> will<00:03:19.100> never<00:03:19.250> put

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
with foam and left that will never put

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.620 
with foam and left that will never put
the<00:03:19.520> receiver<00:03:19.850> they're<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.300> only<00:03:20.450> other

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
the receiver they're the only other

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.240 
the receiver they're the only other
thing<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.840> have<00:03:21.050> not<00:03:21.260> installed<00:03:21.500> yet<00:03:21.830> that's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
thing I have not installed yet that's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.360 
thing I have not installed yet that's
been<00:03:22.370> also<00:03:22.610> doing<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.300> Bay<00:03:23.570> right<00:03:23.780> there<00:03:24.050> is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
been also doing that Bay right there is

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.090 
been also doing that Bay right there is
my<00:03:25.370> current<00:03:25.700> sensor<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.390> UST<00:03:26.870> now<00:03:27.800> my

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
my current sensor for the UST now my

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.410 
my current sensor for the UST now my
antenna<00:03:28.730> runs<00:03:29.209> all<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.510> way<00:03:29.660> up<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.080> wing<00:03:32.080> and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
antenna runs all the way up the wing and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.500 
antenna runs all the way up the wing and
up<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.690> side<00:03:35.900> here<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.090> hopefully<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.450> will

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
up the side here so hopefully that will

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.410 
up the side here so hopefully that will
balance<00:03:38.720> out<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.440> drag<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.610> on<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.940> wing<00:03:41.120> tip

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
balance out the drag it on the wing tip

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.770 
balance out the drag it on the wing tip
but<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.020> get<00:03:42.260> from<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.590> circular<00:03:43.100> polarized

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
but I get from this circular polarized

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.990 
but I get from this circular polarized
cloverleaf<00:03:45.370> antenna<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.330> there<00:03:47.600> we<00:03:47.780> have<00:03:47.810> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
cloverleaf antenna so there we have it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.580 
cloverleaf antenna so there we have it
I'm<00:03:50.000> looking<00:03:50.540> forward<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.020> getting<00:03:51.170> out<00:03:51.350> there

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
I'm looking forward to getting out there

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.820 
I'm looking forward to getting out there
and<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.920> them<00:03:52.070> if<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.340> thing<00:03:52.550> flies<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:54.320> like

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
and see them if this thing flies I like

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.880 
and see them if this thing flies I like
the<00:03:55.239> foam<00:03:56.239> like<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:58.480> build<00:03:59.480> quality<00:03:59.780> of<00:04:00.620> its

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the foam like the build quality of its

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.229 
the foam like the build quality of its
really<00:04:01.370> easy<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.760> put<00:04:01.940> together<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:04.239> design

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
really easy to put together the design

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.820 
really easy to put together the design
of<00:04:05.270> this<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.720> lot<00:04:05.959> different<00:04:06.200> from<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.620> nine

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
of this is a lot different from the nine

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.490 
of this is a lot different from the nine
hundred<00:04:07.220> millimeter<00:04:07.610> pop<00:04:07.880> wing<00:04:08.350> think<00:04:09.350> that

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
hundred millimeter pop wing think that

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.380 
hundred millimeter pop wing think that
nine<00:04:09.680> hundred<00:04:10.010> millimeters<00:04:10.459> got<00:04:10.700> more<00:04:10.970> sweep

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
nine hundred millimeters got more sweep

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.460 
nine hundred millimeters got more sweep
and<00:04:11.660> it's<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.500> more<00:04:12.680> cord<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:15.140> one's<00:04:15.350> a

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
and it's got more cord this one's a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.810 
and it's got more cord this one's a
little<00:04:15.620> bit<00:04:15.890> less<00:04:16.190> sweet<00:04:16.520> water<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:18.820> some

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
little bit less sweet water so some

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.699 
little bit less sweet water so some
people<00:04:20.030> say<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.299> flies<00:04:20.510> okay<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.230> lot<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.500> people

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
people say it flies okay a lot of people

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.270 
people say it flies okay a lot of people
say<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.010> flies<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.430> crack<00:04:23.110> who<00:04:24.110> knows<00:04:24.350> got<00:04:25.100> it

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
say it flies like crack who knows got it

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.410 
say it flies like crack who knows got it
I'm<00:04:25.850> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.120> use<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.190> anyway

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
I'm going to use it so anyway

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.000 
I'm going to use it so anyway
that's<00:04:29.810> what<00:04:29.990> I'm<00:04:30.080> done<00:04:30.260> with<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.500> pot<00:04:30.650> point

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
that's what I'm done with the pot point

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.870 
that's what I'm done with the pot point
look<00:04:32.000> forward<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.540> making<00:04:32.990> flight<00:04:33.410> video<00:04:33.880> this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
look forward to making flight video this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.980 
look forward to making flight video this
weekend<00:04:35.300> we're<00:04:35.390> supposed<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.600> have<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> great

the twelve hundred millimeter pop wing

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.410 
the twelve hundred millimeter pop wing
dimensions<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:51.640> sweep<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.910> all<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.210> is

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
dimensions and sweep and all that is

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.570 
dimensions and sweep and all that is
very<00:04:54.170> very<00:04:54.320> very<00:04:55.070> similar<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:56.800> my<00:04:57.800> 52<00:04:58.220> inch

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
very very very similar to my 52 inch

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.830 
very very very similar to my 52 inch
zagnuts<00:04:59.330> wings<00:04:59.660> that<00:04:59.990> i've<00:05:00.170> been<00:05:00.380> flying<00:05:01.840> it's

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
zagnuts wings that i've been flying it's

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.830 
zagnuts wings that i've been flying it's
about<00:05:03.140> four<00:05:03.470> inches<00:05:04.360> smaller<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:05.810> the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
about four inches smaller in the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.730 
about four inches smaller in the
wingspan<00:05:07.150> but<00:05:08.150> laid<00:05:08.330> on<00:05:08.510> top<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:09.440> almost

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
wingspan but laid on top it's almost

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:25.900 
wingspan but laid on top it's almost
identical<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:22.840> will<00:05:23.840> say<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.440> zagnuts<00:05:24.920> is

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
identical I will say this the zagnuts is

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.250 
identical I will say this the zagnuts is
quite<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.570> bit<00:05:26.720> thicker<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:29.030> it's<00:05:29.660> probably<00:05:30.080> a

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
quite a bit thicker so it's probably a

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.630 
quite a bit thicker so it's probably a
slower<00:05:30.680> flying<00:05:31.400> wing<00:05:32.860> pop<00:05:33.860> one<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.160> probably

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
slower flying wing pop one is probably

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.220 
slower flying wing pop one is probably
going<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:35.000> want<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.780> go<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.930> little<00:05:36.200> bit<00:05:36.380> faster

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
going to want to go a little bit faster

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.910 
going to want to go a little bit faster
but<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.260> just<00:05:39.410> thought<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.590> was<00:05:39.800> interesting

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
but I just thought that was interesting

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.720 
but I just thought that was interesting
as<00:05:40.340> far<00:05:40.520> as<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.730> dimensions<00:05:41.180> were<00:05:41.300> concerned
