00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
working on things you'd think that we

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.550 
working on things you'd think that we
would<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.630> somehow<00:01:09.900> gotten<00:01:10.229> through

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
would have somehow gotten through

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
would have somehow gotten through
everything<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.729> there'd<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.030> nothing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
everything and that there'd be nothing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
everything and that there'd be nothing
else<00:01:12.479> evolving<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> point<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:13.890> oddly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
else evolving at this point but oddly

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640 
else evolving at this point but oddly
enough<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
enough there still is and I think

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.060 
enough there still is and I think
there's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.250> sweetness<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.560> how<00:01:19.560> are

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there's a sweetness to that how are

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
there's a sweetness to that how are
things<00:01:20.420> today<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:21.780> between<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> two

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
things today right now between the two

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.660 
things today right now between the two
of<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> they're<00:01:24.000> great<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.540> mean<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.670> it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
of you they're great I mean you know it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.789 
of you they're great I mean you know it
has<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.180> always<00:01:27.450> been<00:01:27.600> easy<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.140> either<00:01:28.530> one

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
has not always been easy for either one

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.630 
has not always been easy for either one
of<00:01:28.829> us<00:01:29.240> having<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> couple<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.490> know

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
of us having been a couple back you know

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
of us having been a couple back you know
in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> early<00:01:33.570> days<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.380> nothing<00:01:34.680> like

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
in the early days there's nothing like

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
in the early days there's nothing like
success<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.600> sort<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> shake<00:01:36.869> things<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
success to sort of shake things up I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
success to sort of shake things up I
think<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> catalyst<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.180> us

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
think that was a catalyst for us

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
think that was a catalyst for us
breaking<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:41.040> many<00:01:41.310> ways<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.530> yet<00:01:44.009> through

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
breaking up in many ways and yet through

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
breaking up in many ways and yet through
all<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.630> both<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> find<00:01:46.470> our

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
