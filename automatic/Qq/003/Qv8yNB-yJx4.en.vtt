me the thing that stands out to me and
the<00:00:55.440> mood<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.340> am<00:00:56.670> loving<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.210> probably

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the mood that I am loving is probably

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
the mood that I am loving is probably
one<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.780> favorite<00:00:58.320> modes<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> moment

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
one of my favorite modes at the moment

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
one of my favorite modes at the moment
is<00:00:59.629> capture<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> flag<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.910> it's<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.090> okay

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is capture the flag now it's just okay

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
is capture the flag now it's just okay
so<00:01:03.719> first<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.040> maps<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.939> suit

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so first off the maps really suit

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
so first off the maps really suit
capture<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> flag<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> tell<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.220> maps

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
capture the flag you can tell these maps

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
capture the flag you can tell these maps
were<00:01:08.850> designed<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.479> capture<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> flag<00:01:10.260> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
were designed for capture the flag so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
were designed for capture the flag so
you've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.159> basic<00:01:11.729> middle<00:01:12.570> route<00:01:12.869> but

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you've got your basic middle route but

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
you've got your basic middle route but
then<00:01:13.560> they've<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.850> plenty<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
then they've got like these plenty of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
then they've got like these plenty of
flanking<00:01:15.750> routes<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.680> see

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
flanking routes but you don't really see

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.249 
flanking routes but you don't really see
the<00:01:17.189> flanking<00:01:17.640> routes<00:01:17.820> until<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> learn<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the flanking routes until you learn the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
the flanking routes until you learn the
maps<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> learning<00:01:20.400> curve<00:01:20.729> with

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
maps so there is a learning curve with

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
maps so there is a learning curve with
these<00:01:21.180> maps<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.110> absolutely<00:01:22.799> awesome

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
these maps which are absolutely awesome

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.609 
these maps which are absolutely awesome
the<00:01:23.820> map<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.360> looking<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the map you're looking at right now is a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.030 
the map you're looking at right now is a
key<00:01:26.250> SR<00:01:26.610> railroad<00:01:27.299> Kaiser<00:01:27.750> rail<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:28.979> know

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
key SR railroad Kaiser rail I don't know

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
key SR railroad Kaiser rail I don't know
how<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> pronounce<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.820> burner<00:01:30.119> yeah<00:01:30.689> Kearse<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
how to pronounce it burner yeah Kearse I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
how to pronounce it burner yeah Kearse I
railroad<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> yeah<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> can

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
railroad I think it is and yeah you can

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
railroad I think it is and yeah you can
see<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.350> huge<00:01:34.770> railroad<00:01:35.460> but

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
see there's like a huge railroad but

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.210 
see there's like a huge railroad but
around<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> you've<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.229> mountains<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
around it you've got these mountains and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.770 
around it you've got these mountains and
you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> actually<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> mountains

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you can actually go around the mountains

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.410 
you can actually go around the mountains
and<00:01:39.990> capture<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> flag<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.000> yeah<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and capture the flag and so yeah so

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
and capture the flag and so yeah so
that's<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.780> cool<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> reason<00:01:43.829> I'm

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that's really cool so the reason I'm

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
that's really cool so the reason I'm
loving<00:01:44.460> capture<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> flag<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.720> does

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
loving capture the flag is it does

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
loving capture the flag is it does
something<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> no<00:01:46.979> other<00:01:47.009> mode<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
something that no other mode can do it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.130 
something that no other mode can do it
forces<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> rush<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.720> sit<00:01:51.990> back

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
forces you to rush now if you sit back

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
forces you to rush now if you sit back
in<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.380> own<00:01:52.619> base<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.369> much<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
in your own base not much is going to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
in your own base not much is going to
happen<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.479> you're<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:55.020> doing<00:01:55.290> anything<00:01:55.560> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
happen and you're not doing anything for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.920 
happen and you're not doing anything for
the<00:01:56.009> team<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> move<00:01:57.659> forward

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the team you have to move forward

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.410 
the team you have to move forward
because<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.560> flags<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.640> bases<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
because the flags and the bases are so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
because the flags and the bases are so
far<00:02:00.689> separated<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.469> each<00:02:01.560> other<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
far separated from each other that you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
far separated from each other that you
really<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.390> move<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.380> like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
really have to move and I really like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
really have to move and I really like
that<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.460> enjoy<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.149> they're<00:02:06.420> built<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that I really enjoy how they're built it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.180 
that I really enjoy how they're built it
and<00:02:06.990> everything<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:07.979> they've

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and everything and the way they've

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.010 
and everything and the way they've
designed<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.819> maps<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.810> really

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
designed the maps because it really

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.790 
designed the maps because it really
suits<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.830> said<00:02:11.099> but

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
suits that like I said but

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.470 
suits that like I said but
