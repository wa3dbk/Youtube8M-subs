00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.080
 wen 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.500
 open 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.260
 hello to all so on this video I 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.630
 So you'll tuna we talk about the game 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.070
 said first that I play more me 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.230
 present i will introduce you to my 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.600
 chain with in last position 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.540
 the different games that I 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.950
 so go play first when you can 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.310
 so the currently I play on a game 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.280
 which is called auguin is a mmo is this 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.160
 so you are for a player and you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 have not complicated at all so there 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.920
 you have you are on different 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.330
 planets so there you have a planet 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 which is called ground as you can 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 to see him there and then to move forward 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 in the game you must always 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 so you have three resource 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 primary 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.640
 so that they are the terrariums the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
 crystal and the metal so then so 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.180
 it's a game where the goal of the game is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 of comfort his planet 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 so what initially the planet to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.259
 the obvious is not a single building its 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 pallets so there as you can the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.510
 see the age now so the load 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.400
 as you can see there I did 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.880
 different resources so I improved 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.510
 metal momint - crystal mines - 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.280
 guitar there 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.820
 we have so my status 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.070
 auditorium for looting terium more 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 match I was also so is in the process 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.260
 solar electric in order to be able 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.790
 so accentuate the production so there 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.130
 as you can see it's all age and 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.040
 everything set to 100% for sow croisic and I 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.930
 as you can see 33 that me 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.480
 energy rest so time to watch 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.420
 how is this calculation so so they do 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.630
 to calculate his 33 they make 212 held 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 the production -179 that I consume and 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.000
 So the consumption occurs due 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 so had to be called interiors of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.350
 crystal mines and the metal mine 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.060
 whose surfaces vary meaning 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.250
 paramount for once you have 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.170
 build all that with those ci has it a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.510
 Once I built where you have 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.180
 then to continue going in 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 the facility in order to build the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.760
 main building 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.470
 that will allow you to almost do 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.730
 different conquests and who are going 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.650
 will make progress in research 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.530
 the first building that advised 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.670
 build the robot factory because 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.200
 when you go see why straitjacket 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.280
 neighborhood marked on 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.470
 he signs two robots can produce 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340
 sent robots that serve to the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.409
 construction of France 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.950
 the planetary infrastructure so in fact 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.650
 says that initially you do not need to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.840
 rest so that's the first thing that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.340
 you have to build once you 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.989
 have it built it helps to increase 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.409
 the production speed of construction 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.519
 buildings 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.200
 so once one has built 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.260
 every building you go 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.819
 build more the higher level is going 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.209
 allow you to easily play 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.480
 fascinating to play so build 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.330
 faster so 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.739
 then the next thing is to do 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.890
 more research to be able to 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.909
 do the research can after so 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.159
 today and spatial power 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.580
 build there at that moment all that 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.830
 is a spaceship 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.819
 then you have a defense corner so 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.129
 there as you can see I 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.069
 currently two lances put two 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.860
 missile launchers and more fleet 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.280
 garnet the galaxy so that's the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.269
 galaxy with all the planets that ya 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.489
 so here it's the whole planet that has 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.549
 alas enough the elected how can I not 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.889
 still have so that's it for this 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.329
 presentation of this game of om so 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.280
 now I told you about me a little 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.669
 I introduce myself and so my name is 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.780
 Roman I'm 21 years old and I live in 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.780
 Charente Maritime in France 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.110
 so I decided to postpone his 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.110
 gameplay 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.760
 excuse me to have a little fun for 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.229
 to entertain you to please 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.800
 so now I'm going to you 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.800
 talk about them 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:54.870
 I will tell you what to do them 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.660
 on my channel so on this channel so 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.440
 you're going to have to have the game so 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.150
 this game so then the water if you 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.320
 introduce another game but tomorrow this 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.530
 will be another game you present this 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.270
 would be age of empires elsewhere and like 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.919
 you could see him earlier tonight 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.780
 the first two cities and my first 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.970
 video that I did it's a video of 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.400
 world of warcraft on which I will be 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.490
 in company certainly from a friend to 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.050
 me who will accompany me support of our 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.200
 friend of mine who accompanied like this 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.639
 on these games so you introduce yourself 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.840
 several gameplay optics when we 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.740
 see what we did to you 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.169
 have fun to relax 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.930
 then when later later in 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.849
 the month or in later in the future 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.970
 so little borrowed I will introduce you 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.860
 videos on ps3 so with some 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.080
 call of duty videos so request 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.010
 going to take a step from the mill to have 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.360
 accused of 2 of 3 2 call of duty bo1 bo2 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.560
 here is for these gameplay so she you 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.870
 was presenting so it will often be you 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.060
 have 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.120
 you'll see on his videos with edge and 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.380
 7 with lg this place and my account and 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.940
 I believe in the team el g7 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.650
 it's an intimate who greets me 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.930
 welcomed as long as they are super nice 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.050
 elsewhere about whether watching 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.270
 this video then I will make too big 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.830
 which will therefore other wounds troops 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.200
 dispatches on a pile of others 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.270
 games and other little videos like that 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.470
 gameplay dimitri commented on the same 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:26.260
 on far cry du and csx I speak 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.620
 then need for speed them it's a 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.440
 name of the father of the tomb raider does not know it 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.330
 also we say spinter cell head ps 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.800
 if you like ps that moment you 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.290
 can you tell me then you will introduce 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:44.470
 some videos on the ps so here we go 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:47.620
 so on that I hope like this 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.650
 first so I hope you know 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.000
 a little more about me there I continue to 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.630
 play on to gays but I you 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.580
 will present her to you and finance 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.710
 an artwork facing a quick presentation 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.720
 of this game and I'll talk more about it 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.240
 details so after tomorrow certainly 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.610
 where I will introduce you to a lot more 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.220
 this game here I hope we under that 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.230
 you said that you appreciated and 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.440
 that you will enjoy the videos that 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.570
 I will do during the future have 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.240
 stopped do not hesitate to leave a small 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.360
 I like and subscribe on this thank you 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.360
 well
