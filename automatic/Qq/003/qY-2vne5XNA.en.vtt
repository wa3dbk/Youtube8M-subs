last<00:05:56.949> map<00:05:57.160> pack<00:05:57.310> was<00:05:57.460> actually<00:05:57.760> pretty<00:05:57.880> decent

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
last map pack was actually pretty decent

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.219 
last map pack was actually pretty decent
for<00:05:58.300> being<00:05:58.570> such<00:05:59.080> small<00:05:59.350> maps<00:05:59.590> but<00:06:00.490> uh<00:06:01.229> yeah

this<00:06:02.889> map<00:06:03.070> pack<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.610> think<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.240> this<00:06:04.330> is<00:06:04.479> the

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
this map pack I think that this is the

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.879 
this map pack I think that this is the
best<00:06:04.720> one<00:06:04.900> you<00:06:05.350> know<00:06:05.440> what<00:06:05.530> I<00:06:05.560> mean<00:06:05.590> I've<00:06:05.800> only

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
best one you know what I mean I've only

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.590 
best one you know what I mean I've only
played<00:06:06.100> once<00:06:06.400> on<00:06:06.520> each<00:06:06.550> of<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.820> maps<00:06:07.000> but<00:06:07.539> I

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
played once on each of the maps but I

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.940 
played once on each of the maps but I
can<00:06:07.780> already<00:06:07.900> tell<00:06:08.169> that<00:06:08.229> this<00:06:08.380> map<00:06:08.620> pack<00:06:08.800> is

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
can already tell that this map pack is

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.670 
can already tell that this map pack is
by<00:06:09.130> far<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.870> it's<00:06:10.870> gonna<00:06:11.020> be<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:11.320> best<00:06:11.470> I

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
by far the it's gonna be the best I

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.830 
by far the it's gonna be the best I
think<00:06:11.889> for<00:06:12.039> sure<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.310> feels<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.639> best<00:06:12.820> it<00:06:13.150> is

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
think for sure it feels the best it is

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.320 
think for sure it feels the best it is
the<00:06:14.020> best<00:06:14.200> I<00:06:14.500> like<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.010> way<00:06:15.099> it<00:06:15.190> feels<00:06:15.330> feels

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
the best I like the way it feels feels

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.719 
the best I like the way it feels feels
great<00:06:16.539> that's<00:06:16.960> what<00:06:17.139> that<00:06:17.950> this<00:06:18.190> is<00:06:18.340> all<00:06:18.490> just

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
great that's what that this is all just

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.570 
great that's what that this is all just
we<00:06:19.599> just<00:06:19.780> need<00:06:19.900> to<00:06:20.020> accept<00:06:20.139> that<00:06:20.740> sometimes<00:06:21.250> we

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
we just need to accept that sometimes we

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.920 
we just need to accept that sometimes we
say<00:06:21.729> stuff<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.030> sounds<00:06:22.570> like<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.780> could<00:06:22.810> be
