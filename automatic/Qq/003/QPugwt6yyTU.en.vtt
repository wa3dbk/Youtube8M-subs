00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
because everybody else has snapchat so I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
because everybody else has snapchat so I
guess<00:01:20.880> under<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> same<00:01:21.840> logic<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.380> everybody

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
guess under that same logic if everybody

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
guess under that same logic if everybody
was<00:01:23.040> jumping<00:01:23.490> off<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> bridge<00:01:24.030> should<00:01:24.689> Hannah

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
was jumping off a bridge should Hannah

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
was jumping off a bridge should Hannah
and<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.220> everybody<00:01:26.850> else<00:01:27.090> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and I do that because everybody else is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560 
and I do that because everybody else is
doing<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.930> joking<00:01:28.229> aside<00:01:28.470> though<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> want

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
doing all joking aside though we do want

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
doing all joking aside though we do want

losing a good amount of weight that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.230 
losing a good amount of weight that
sounds<00:02:01.710> terrible<00:02:02.340> why<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> hell<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
sounds terrible why the hell would you

sounds terrible why the hell would you
want<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.049> actually<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
want to do that actually I think it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
want to do that actually I think it
might<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.329> might<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> pretty

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
might be a it might actually be a pretty

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.839 
might be a it might actually be a pretty
good<00:02:07.619> idea<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.129> some<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.700> might<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
good idea for some people it might be

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.880 
good idea for some people it might be
beneficial<00:02:09.119> reason<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.530> you're

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
beneficial reason for that is if you're

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.640 
beneficial reason for that is if you're
focusing<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.910> diet<00:02:12.150> around<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.810> basic

an extended period of time for potatoes

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.780 
an extended period of time for potatoes
for<00:02:16.600> example<00:02:16.630> adding<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.950> some<00:02:17.980> greens<00:02:18.520> and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
maybe some vegetables it can I think in

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
sometimes we're just overly stimulated

sometimes we're just overly stimulated
by<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.100> variety<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.580> food<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.420> in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
by the variety of food that we have in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.970 
by the variety of food that we have in
our<00:02:34.660> life<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:34.990> if<00:02:35.140> you're<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:35.740> just

our life so if you're to really just

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.490 
our life so if you're to really just
simplify<00:02:36.970> your<00:02:37.090> diet<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.570> one<00:02:37.810> simple<00:02:38.140> starch

relationship with food by the end of it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.510 
relationship with food by the end of it
you<00:02:43.000> might<00:02:43.209> absolutely<00:02:43.420> hate<00:02:44.290> potatoes<00:02:44.950> but

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
you might absolutely hate potatoes but

you might absolutely hate potatoes but
how<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> think<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:46.120> can<00:02:46.270> really<00:02:46.510> benefit<00:02:46.989> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
how I think that can really benefit you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.100 
how I think that can really benefit you
is<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:48.340> by<00:02:48.520> focusing<00:02:48.970> on<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.660> staple

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
is just by focusing on the one staple

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.640 
is just by focusing on the one staple
food<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.570> either<00:02:52.930> 10<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.350> 60

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it's just so easy to unwind with a glass

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's just so easy to unwind with a glass
of<00:03:38.680> wine<00:03:38.739> since<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.430> habit<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:39.910> first

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
of wine since it's a habit so first

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.150 
of wine since it's a habit so first
thing<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.930> want<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.170> do<00:03:41.290> Hannah<00:03:41.650> told<00:03:42.010> me

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
thing that you want to do Hannah told me

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.680 
thing that you want to do Hannah told me
that<00:03:42.340> basically<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.239> she<00:03:43.360> did<00:03:43.480> was<00:03:43.660> she

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
that basically what she did was she

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.930 
that basically what she did was she
basically<00:03:44.620> quit<00:03:44.920> overnight<00:03:45.340> she<00:03:45.579> just<00:03:45.790> got

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
basically quit overnight she just got

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.569 
basically quit overnight she just got
rid<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.299> alcohol<00:03:46.630> from<00:03:46.780> her<00:03:46.930> house<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.579> I

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
rid of the alcohol from her house and I

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.460 
rid of the alcohol from her house and I
think<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.209> actually<00:03:49.450> including<00:03:50.200> other

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
think that actually including other

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.590 
think that actually including other
activities<00:03:51.070> instead<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.489> unwinding<00:03:52.420> with<00:03:52.480> a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
activities instead of unwinding with a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.880 
activities instead of unwinding with a
glass<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.989> wine<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.200> think<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.560> really<00:03:53.709> good

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
glass of wine I think is a really good

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.360 
glass of wine I think is a really good
idea

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
idea

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.819 
idea
so<00:03:54.640> usually<00:03:54.940> using<00:03:55.690> sparkling<00:03:56.200> water<00:03:56.500> and

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
so usually using sparkling water and

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.069 
so usually using sparkling water and
reading<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.820> think<00:03:58.060> would<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.360> nice<00:03:58.780> way<00:03:59.049> for

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
reading I think would be a nice way for

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.430 
reading I think would be a nice way for
you<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.410> unwind<00:03:59.860> I'm<00:04:00.390> be<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.900> generous<00:04:02.320> with

you to unwind I'm be be generous with
yourself<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.070> in<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.430> way<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.730> if<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.090> want

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
yourself and in the way that if you want

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.210
