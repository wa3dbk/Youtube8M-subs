00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the past two weeks I have been totally

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.189 
the past two weeks I have been totally
neglecting<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.380> hair<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:27.019> had<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
neglecting my hair and I had this

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.950 
neglecting my hair and I had this
handled<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.519> weeks<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.539> hair<00:00:30.810> was

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
handled in two weeks and so my hair was

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
handled in two weeks and so my hair was
like<00:00:31.080> completely<00:00:31.640> matted<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> point

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
like completely matted like to the point

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.580 
like completely matted like to the point
where<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:33.960> almost<00:00:34.200> locking<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.380> had

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
where it was almost locking so if I had

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
where it was almost locking so if I had
to<00:00:37.800> tangled<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.370> hair<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.390> had

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to tangled my hair I would have had

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
to tangled my hair I would have had
severe<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> breakage<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
severe and breakage so I was just like I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
severe and breakage so I was just like I
rather<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.410> short<00:00:43.800> hair<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> have

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
rather just have short hair than to have

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.440 
rather just have short hair than to have
being<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.510> broken<00:00:46.320> ends<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.700> that's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
being like broken ends and so that's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.010 
being like broken ends and so that's
what<00:00:48.600> made<00:00:48.780> me<00:00:48.899> decide<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:50.600> eventually<00:00:51.600> big

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.430 
maybe even like a 4b um it's kind of a
little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.410> loose<00:03:35.769> now<00:03:36.100> but<00:03:36.760> um<00:03:37.139> I'm<00:03:38.139> sure

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
little bit loose now but um I'm sure

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.860 
little bit loose now but um I'm sure
that's<00:03:38.680> from<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.220> relaxed<00:03:39.579> dance<00:03:39.880> being<00:03:40.660> on
