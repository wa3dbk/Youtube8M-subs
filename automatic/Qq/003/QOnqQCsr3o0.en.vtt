00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to a minecraft view of 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.000
 minecraft pocket and today the whole 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.710
 simply a modification that calls itself 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 inventory retreat means this one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 our inventory will do that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.769
 small but very practical and fine 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 and I think before I give them big 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 start talking like direct x so we 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.210
 Just go for a box 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.609
 in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 that is totally now that is already 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.550
 sorted so you can also unsorted 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.830
 leave so I go again now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 here are just some 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 items here purely mixed look easy 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.009
 We now have different blocks 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 we do all my the crate a 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.430
 mixture then again maybe here 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 travel blog and when we did that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.370
 we can sort them easily as well 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.559
 we want that means you will be in the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 arranged or completely normal 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.899
 one after the other or from top to bottom 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 So there are some possibilities 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.480
 we can discuss too 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.219
 options 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.690
 that means we can adjust if 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.579
 this test button we saw 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 we displayed clicking a box 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 should and where we do it automatically 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 there are number options to sort 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.969
 we automatically when we push rather 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 can be quite normal and very inventory 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.000
 sort that I will now again 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 show if we are normal now if we 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 Something mixed it in here with it 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 you, for example , the whole of her 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 separated and again separated if we 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 now rather dry as the whole easy 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.229
 and then it becomes, so to speak 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.580
 inventory sorted which on the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.320
 options then just go to the controls 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.150
 Excuse me if we leave then 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.890
 go inventory or a box and then 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 Here at the point point point 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.329
 Can we be the hard drives to the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.150
 shortcuts what is it for 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.500
 so to speak so abbreviations yes you can 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.689
 you look at yourself 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.820
 about specific key combination room 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.409
 set certain things and that can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.619
 one at or account that is also 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.380
 you should leave in the middle click 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.240
 So the unnecessary car ran that I bet 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 now show that too 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.250
 actually quite good so if I am now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.100
 For example, I take here I have 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 I'm giving out of the game mode degree and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.860
 Let's take a blog of it when I do 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 Now you can set it up 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 that then directly refilled 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.280
 that means I have 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 that all blocks are set by this yes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.200
 I have finished the whole thing and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.360
 then we can easily adjust 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.129
 as I had set that now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.019
 that means it will be filled immediately 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.480
 that means we have now for example 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.400
 two of them now keep pushing 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.010
 continue and then you can set that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.329
 that it will stop automatically 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.370
 So the abbess is refilled 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.599
 filed and then and then can come 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.790
 has set that up again 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.260
 pulled over this is the deck 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.730
 as I guess that watching us now 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.060
 Just let's just go 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.190
 Let's go in our box on point 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.769
 dot point and that's what the story has to offer 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.829
 for that one can make out others 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.450
 mohr option stop automatic one endures 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.120
 that if you have armor in the inventory 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.579
 this is equipped but have sound 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.760
 and should the whole thing if you already have things 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:16.290
 to be sorted 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.060
 yes and then there are still so mapping 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.579
 files there you can do it all over again 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.319
 deny access now so denied 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.940
 there you can again certain 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 adjust settings but now 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 actually unnecessarily the whole is here 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.549
 if that's enough we can do it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.980
 seeds and that's just easy 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.530
 quickly in multiplayer his boxes or 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.849
 rearrange other and after completed 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.319
 so fast is a very good one 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.329
 possibility is definitely too 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.359
 recommend and I say thank you 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.470

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.400

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.579
 automatic still a bit down 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.949
 this just scrolls to the download here 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.489
 click on it and it will open 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:04.019
 it's free we wait five seconds and 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.790
 then skip the whole thing now 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.079

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.229
 start the or we start at the 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.849
 download in the folder we save that 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.410
 Whole where we want to see we need 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.940
 oslo has to be installed 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 But I get the installation 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.630
 think here and there we have to 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.910
 in 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.680
 android will have it on the desktop 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.890
 just press windows button r 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.290
 percent sign ap the ta percent sign 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.900
 Enter a point team 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.370
 in and then we have the here 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.400
 mods folder if we stick to the motto 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.320
 install and easy citrix only 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.040
 in here that was ever we need 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.840
 not do 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.700
 so we have the whole thing installed 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.980
