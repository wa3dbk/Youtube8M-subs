00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
bought both for them and I can imagine

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.260 
bought both for them and I can imagine
i'm<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.400> able<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> sell<00:01:41.790> them<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
i'm going to be able to sell them for a

because the only reason they're going to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
because the only reason they're going to
sell<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.750> those<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:53.159> know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
sell is because they have those you know

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
sell is because they have those you know
they<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.549> chemistry<00:01:54.000> styles<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.390> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
they have those chemistry styles on so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.030 
they have those chemistry styles on so
that's<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:55.500> sick<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

market and see if there's any more with

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.870 
market and see if there's any more with
chemistry<00:02:04.740> styles<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> nope<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.759> all

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
chemistry styles on it nope they all

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
chemistry styles on it nope they all
have<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.360> basic<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.590> i'm

going to and then i'm going to show you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650 
going to and then i'm going to show you
guys<00:02:10.500> another<00:02:10.950> method<00:02:11.129> which<00:02:11.459> will<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.940> which

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
guys another method which will not which

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.920 
guys another method which will not which
will<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:12.989> deal<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.620> vine

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
will not deal with like vine

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.929 
will not deal with like vine
and<00:02:14.230> stuff<00:02:14.409> but<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.890> always<00:02:15.609> check<00:02:15.640> these

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
and stuff but and always check these

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.640 
and stuff but and always check these
methods<00:02:16.329> because<00:02:16.629> you<00:02:16.870> know<00:02:16.989> some<00:02:17.260> people<00:02:17.290> are

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650

quite<00:02:17.920> idiotic<00:02:18.189> at<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.819> game<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.209> they<00:02:19.269> will

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
quite idiotic at this game and they will

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.780 
quite idiotic at this game and they will
just<00:02:19.540> list<00:02:19.810> some<00:02:20.319> random<00:02:20.560> player<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.640> you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
just list some random player that you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.789 
just list some random player that you
know<00:02:21.909> is<00:02:22.030> worth<00:02:22.180> quite<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> bit<00:02:22.569> for<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.349> 200

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
know is worth quite a bit for like 200

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.229 
know is worth quite a bit for like 200
coins<00:02:23.920> or<00:02:24.159> something<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.609> always<00:02:24.819> check<00:02:24.969> this

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
coins or something so always check this

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.179 
coins or something so always check this
method<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:25.780> see<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.409> can<00:02:26.590> grab<00:02:26.769> yourself

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
method and see if you can grab yourself

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.880 
method and see if you can grab yourself
a<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.640> cheap<00:02:27.909> player<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:29.379> anyway

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
a really cheap player and but anyway

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.679 
a really cheap player and but anyway

you<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.150> these<00:04:28.330> methods<00:04:28.750> tend<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.230> work

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
you know these methods tend to work

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.650 
you know these methods tend to work
better<00:04:29.560> at<00:04:29.740> night<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.550> know<00:04:30.670> which<00:04:31.330> ever<00:04:31.540> you

for 2,000 so we'll type in his name see
what<00:04:36.610> how<00:04:36.820> much<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.330> know<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.540> cheapest<00:04:37.840> by

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
what how much you know the cheapest by

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.740 
what how much you know the cheapest by
now<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.350> on<00:04:38.500> oz<00:04:39.130> minh<00:04:39.430> he's<00:04:40.300> gone<00:04:40.480> for<00:04:40.630> two

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
now is on oz minh he's gone for two

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.570 
now is on oz minh he's gone for two
thousand<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.830> cheaper<00:04:42.220> spire<00:04:42.400> now

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
thousand here and it's cheaper spire now

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.120 
thousand here and it's cheaper spire now
is<00:04:42.990> 2200<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.320> would<00:04:44.440> not<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.800> good<00:04:44.860> buy

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
is 2200 so that would not be a good buy

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.680 
is 2200 so that would not be a good buy
because<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.640> would<00:04:45.730> actually<00:04:46.060> lose<00:04:46.210> profit

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
because you would actually lose profit

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.930 
because you would actually lose profit
on<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.260> EA<00:04:47.410> tax<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.460> know<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.730> was<00:04:48.880> a

on the EA tax but you know this was a

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.400 
on the EA tax but you know this was a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.410 
know I still I still do trade with
silver<00:05:39.100> ppl<00:05:39.430> plays<00:05:39.580> because<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:40.030> works<00:05:40.180> so

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
silver ppl plays because it works so

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.260 
silver ppl plays because it works so
well<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.890> but<00:05:41.890> this<00:05:42.280> is<00:05:42.340> like<00:05:42.640> what<00:05:42.880> time's<00:05:43.090> it

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
well and but this is like what time's it

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.580 
well and but this is like what time's it
now<00:05:43.330> it's<00:05:43.480> like<00:05:43.600> coming<00:05:43.900> up<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.080> four<00:05:44.320> o'clock

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
now it's like coming up to four o'clock

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.290 
now it's like coming up to four o'clock
so<00:05:44.800> it's<00:05:45.190> not<00:05:45.280> really<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.520> good<00:05:45.670> time<00:05:45.730> to<00:05:46.060> trade

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
so it's not really a good time to trade

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.880 
so it's not really a good time to trade
and<00:05:46.600> that<00:05:46.750> is<00:05:46.840> why<00:05:46.990> I'm<00:05:47.080> getting<00:05:47.290> a<00:05:47.440> bit<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> lot

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
and that is why I'm getting a bit a lot

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.530 
and that is why I'm getting a bit a lot
but<00:05:48.070> if<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.580> use<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.940> method<00:05:49.120> at<00:05:49.390> night

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540
