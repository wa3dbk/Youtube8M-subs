 not having this season 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.399
 so, let's begin 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.399

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.540
 that is, almost in the very agreement 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.540
 combination 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.620
 Ie agent world 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.130
 so that it looks like the original 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130

 to pass tis format components itself 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 however i need to go to the stream command 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.479
 do we turn 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479

 still our picture format has changed 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.659
 in 2 square 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.879

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.199
 we reach the decline 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.709
 joe demonstrate 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 which is visually yo 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.439
 by the hour 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.159
 but it is possible that the first framework 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.759
