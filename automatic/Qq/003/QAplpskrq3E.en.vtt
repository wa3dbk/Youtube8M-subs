00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.390
 behind my back 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.309
 It is installed fence of corrugated board 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 frame if you saw our previous 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.750
 Pulley set nicks and Shtaket 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.759
 also there are no differences but there 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 today we wanted to talk about full 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.039
 installation cycle and the problem of choice we 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
 we are near the village of Sychev and thunder here 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.510
 not the best clay and hammer to me 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.430
 it would be very difficult but in such a ground 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.949
 clogged would become very 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.269
 firmly and very long 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.329
 originally this fence was planned 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.450
 800 meter high of two way 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.790
 sheeting 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 but during a conversation with the customer a plan 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 changed the fence grew by 20 centimeters 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 and became one-sided 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 and the reason is when you send 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 colored decking inside his 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.100
 small as in this case area 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.680
 you immediately see its small size 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.410
 become darker in general impression not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.989
 those that were expected are another thing if 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.820
 Decking light or directed to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.730
 plot is not colored side 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.449
 then one of depression is not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.600
 will arise 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.450
 and so the frame is ready it consists of tables 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 60 to 60 and lacquer 40 to 25 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.520
 we set would become strictly according 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520
 level 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.759
 for this fence we made reinforced 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.710
 set gate this means that besides 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.859
 he will strengthen the main frame with additional 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.409
 profile and profiled in such a gate 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.750
 it is not ice that is inserted again but inside the frame 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.539
 the people are not only firmly but still 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.069
 Aesthetically looks we fasten the sheets we 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.049
 we do it on self-tapping screws 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.060
 a bit more expensive will be installation 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.859
 sheets on the rivets however against 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.640
 rights theft wore it usually not 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:49.159
 saves saves combined approach 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:02:01.069
 this or riveting plus screws or 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:03.079
 screws plus bolts last element 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.270
 our today's fence has become here 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.780
 such is the finishing bar which 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.310
 worn on top of the sheet and does not require that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.379
 that she was fastened she just 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 just the bee comes out the total cost 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.489
 a similar fence for May 2013 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.799
 amounted to 74 thousand entered here entered himself 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.750
 fencing set of corrugated 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.450
 skeleton gate reinforced dismantling the old 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 fence frame painting 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.519
 complementary profile element of this will give 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.859
 bar and delivery more than 100
