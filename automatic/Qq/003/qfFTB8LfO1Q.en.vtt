months ago so I'm just going to show you
guys<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.160> build<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.940> single-player

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
guys how to build this in single-player

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.319 
guys how to build this in single-player
because<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.460> GTA<00:00:35.730> 5<00:00:35.969> online<00:00:36.090> it's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
because if I do it in GTA 5 online it's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.700 
because if I do it in GTA 5 online it's
gonna<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.600> hard<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> hardtop<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
gonna be hard to get the hardtop and I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
gonna be hard to get the hardtop and I
don't<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.399> money<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> spare<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
don't have that much money to spare in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
don't have that much money to spare in
GTA<00:00:39.809> online<00:00:39.840> anyway<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> waste<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
GTA online anyway so it's a waste of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.139 
GTA online anyway so it's a waste of
money<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> guys<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
money but if you guys can get the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.250 
money but if you guys can get the
hardtop<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.540> build<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:42.989> GTA<00:00:43.230> online

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
hardtop and build it in GTA online

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
hardtop and build it in GTA online
that's<00:00:43.710> great<00:00:44.210> anyway<00:00:45.210> beats

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that's great anyway beats

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
that's great anyway beats
build<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.469> simple<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
build is really simple because the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
build is really simple because the
customization<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> stallion<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
customization with the stallion is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
customization with the stallion is
pretty<00:00:48.899> limited<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.920> pretty<00:00:50.070> much<00:00:50.160> looks

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
pretty limited and it pretty much looks

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.180 
pretty limited and it pretty much looks
like<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.879> plymouth<00:00:51.449> barracuda<00:00:51.770> stock<00:00:52.770> anyway

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
like the plymouth barracuda stock anyway

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400 
like the plymouth barracuda stock anyway
so<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:53.969> you've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.079> change

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
so all you've got to do really is change

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
so all you've got to do really is change
the<00:00:55.530> color<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> metallic<00:00:56.340> black<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.059> for

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the color to a metallic black and for

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.000 
the color to a metallic black and for
extra<00:00:57.660> shine<00:00:57.899> I've<00:00:58.140> recommend<00:00:58.590> adding<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
extra shine I've recommend adding a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
extra shine I've recommend adding a
pearlescent<00:00:59.399> blueish<00:00:59.940> silver<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.140> you've

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pearlescent blueish silver then you've

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080 
pearlescent blueish silver then you've
want<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> wheels<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.520> black<00:01:02.789> top

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
want to change the wheels to black top

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840 
want to change the wheels to black top
under<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.750> muscle<00:01:04.470> class<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> change<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
under the muscle class and change the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
under the muscle class and change the
color<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.479> black<00:01:06.720> steel<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> also

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
color of that to black steel then I also

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.590 
color of that to black steel then I also
recommend<00:01:08.939> putting<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> lower<00:01:09.390> suspension

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
recommend putting the lower suspension

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
recommend putting the lower suspension
on<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> build<00:01:11.970> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
on and there we are for the build it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
on and there we are for the build it's
really<00:01:12.479> simple<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.900> those<00:01:13.229> three<00:01:13.439> things

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
really simple just those three things

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
really simple just those three things
that<00:01:13.799> you've<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> change<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.420> do

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that you've got to change and now we do

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
that you've got to change and now we do
recommend<00:01:15.930> lowering<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> manually<00:01:16.860> after

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
recommend lowering it manually after

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
recommend lowering it manually after
you've<00:01:17.400> come<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> ALS<00:01:18.360> customs<00:01:18.810> as

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you've come out of the ALS customs as

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
you've come out of the ALS customs as
the<00:01:19.170> wheels<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.650> quite<00:01:19.890> small<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> does

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the wheels are quite small and it does

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
the wheels are quite small and it does
give<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> illusion<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> fitment<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
give the illusion that the fitment that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.730 
give the illusion that the fitment that
Letty's<00:01:23.520> barracuda<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.750> even

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
Letty's barracuda actually has even

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
Letty's barracuda actually has even
though<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> real<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.250> sits<00:01:26.520> high<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> wheels

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
though the real one sits high the wheels

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
though the real one sits high the wheels
are<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.659> small<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> stallion<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
are just too small on the stallion to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
are just too small on the stallion to
fit<00:01:28.979> nicely<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.909> they've<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> better

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
fit nicely so they've just got a better

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
fit nicely so they've just got a better
fit<00:01:30.840> meant<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> ride<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> lower<00:01:32.700> rather

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
fit meant when the ride is lower rather

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569 
fit meant when the ride is lower rather
than<00:01:33.270> high<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.740> lower<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.189> you've<00:01:35.310> got<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
than high so to lower all you've got to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.069
