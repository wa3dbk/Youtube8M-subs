gameplay video showing dynamic DNA in
NBA<00:00:32.669> live<00:00:32.940> 09<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> dynamic<00:00:38.520> DNA<00:00:38.940> basically<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
NBA live 09 so dynamic DNA basically it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
NBA live 09 so dynamic DNA basically it
breaks<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.559> three<00:00:40.890> main<00:00:41.129> areas<00:00:41.370> first

tendencies and player tendencies is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
tendencies and player tendencies is
basically<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> decision-making<00:00:47.190> process<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
basically a decision-making process that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.069 
basically a decision-making process that
every<00:00:48.180> player<00:00:48.329> goes<00:00:48.690> through<00:00:48.960> whether

they're going to drive to the right

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.279 
they're going to drive to the right
drive<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> left<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> shot<00:00:52.079> and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
points to the fact that he should post

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.310 
points to the fact that he should post
up<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.850> Garnett<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.630> Matt<00:03:09.780> take<00:03:10.020> us<00:03:10.140> away
