00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Gundam 1/60 Scale 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.150
 Mass production type Gergug 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:18.849
 The 1/60 scale mass production type Gergug was released in March 1983. 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:22.920
 Of course it is the last kit of 1/60 scale , and the contents are same with Shahr's gel gug. 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:27.810
 The figure of the Zion army was also attached 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.770
 It was released when I forgot more than a year to be delayed by Charg Gel Gug of the same scale 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
 It is not Christmas, but I was surprised to see a big child left in the store 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.260
 The 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.510
 I really can not buy a kit that is stupid at such a time- I already have a mobile suit next month 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.910
 Variations of the kit will be released 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.220
 It was a time Te is to weak to drink or to buy a high-mobility type Zaku 2 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 I saved my money, but at the time it was through 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.420
 Is prepared to deal kit price is also Deca drinking do it by the box to be 2500 yen 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.770
 Even if I change it, I can see where I'm going to hide- 0 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.470
 The ultimate Gerugg at that time was surely only there, and it was a great place. 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.190
 Hey you 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.690
 Certainly features き っ と shoulder width is wide, something short foot 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.800
 A total of fist is in Sunge to'm totally collapsed impression bonus 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.500
 But what I said was that Gakincho at the time , including this one, was cool. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.220
 Value to true 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 For me, the head is the best done with the old kit gelugug excellent 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.620
 If you buy the wheat cute AA batteries terms of Mono Eye is capable of running 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 You can make it glow, but you can not exchange it even if you lose wheat 9 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.930
 It is still as usual that the battery box has no switch, and two batteries 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.800
 It hurts that it will surely become heavy if we put in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.460
 It was not reproduced in the 1/144 or 1/100 kit 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:46.560
 I'm also glad I realized the movement of the head and nose and shoulder 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 It is a bit disappointing that the movable range of the elbows and knees is narrow, especially because the elbow joints are weak 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.920
 I need to pay attention to my legs 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.100
 The It can be in the shape of Ha was outstanding the installation of Nde a wide range of movement of the ankle 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.509
 I am 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.650
 If you look at it now, your eyes will only go to a point that is useless 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.100
 It's Ali in 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:08.369
 Erg was not kitted in the Perfect Grade series 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.269
 I'm what this kit 1/60 scale best kit of still 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.140
 Joint If you recovered is better to use the heavy-duty parts it Yosage 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:20.430
 In'm just proportions strange place too there are various parts of the volume 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.990
 I such sure to garbled do it by extending the various parts in the cut was stuck was or Prabang 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:30.550
 I think it is better to extend at Toka Prabang especially Nde thigh is too short 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.930
 I'm sure I'm such a place you want to change the mounting position we have that too far is huge as hand 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:39.790
 It is safer to divert it from other large kits than to recover your joints 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:44.320
 It would be easier if I was supposed to be a god, but I do not come out so much in anime 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.010
 It is difficult to grasp the image because it is a mobile suit, but now it has appeared in various works 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.189
 I am honest but honest 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.060
 I got a bazooka in the Zeta Gundam and I was broken down 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.480
 There is only an image of Naginata swinging in the Gatapon Warrior Scramble Wars. 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.799
 Ne 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 Not of Gundam boom generation human So buy it Does not schedule is likely 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:06.459
 Well now the child also'm would think from the time being put into the hands Nde basic physical principle 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.459
 There are a lot of guys who don't know 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.010
 What is that, is it delicious
