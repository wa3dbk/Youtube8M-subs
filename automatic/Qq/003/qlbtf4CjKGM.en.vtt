00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 Clear 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.129
 that kids of high heels doctor write 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.119
 and we keep discovering the secrets 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.130
 here from mother and kids this time I'm going 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.230
 to bring the achievement that many are 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.680
 asking are the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.779
 questions with regard to how to 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.390
 performs the achievement of stuck in the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.310
 time tells us that mobility uses and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
 improves all the traps before the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.260
 round 10 kids the first thing we have 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.440
 what to do to achieve this achievement 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.369
 what I tell you is very simple 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.720
 get the guard's key first 

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:46.309
 jaws at this moment on screen we are 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.839
 seeing how to have the guard key 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.330
 in case you did not know how 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.580
 it's just about looking for it 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.040
 basically once we find him 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.939
 we put in afterlife mode and already with 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.739
 this electrocuted on the cpu of the 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.239
 computer that is holding it and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.059
 well now we're going to start 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.360
 What do we have to do? 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.049
 basically is to use the traps if you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 they realize they use and improve the traps 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.260
 more does not say that all the traps have 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 to be improved 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.190
 but if it says that you all have to use them and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.020
 good kids, let's start first 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.300
 with which everyone knows that is the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.430
 the knives or I do not know what it's called but 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.080
 well this trap is in the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 guard's office in garn guards 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.580
 howard deaths office but in this is from 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.060
 a thousand points the cost I recommend 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.920
 kids that are going to use it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 so basically take advantage of the are not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.670
 thousand points that will take us there and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.490
 Well, it really was worth it 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.250
 those thousand points that we spend guaje to me 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.229
 if I use them, I say that they are going to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.520
 win but well let's continue with 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.080
 the next the following traps 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.330
 find the cafeteria this trap the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.850
 we know like the acid trap kids 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.280
 here it is very simple again a thousand points 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.040
 we activate the trap and ready we have 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.290
 two traps used and we only need 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.880
 three and you say hey what is the other 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.610
 trap there are many who have not had the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 opportunity to see the map well or not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 they have fixed the correct thing so we throw 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.690
 let's go to the area where is the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.760
 dock for these shows I use the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.110
 gondolas to make me more 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.910
 Economic instead 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.890
 to the 10,000 doors that come 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.110
 buying from above until you can leave 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
 to the dock watching you all over the area 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.100
 tunnels agree so well that's 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.960
 as my recommendation to you and 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
 you like and for which no 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.760
 problem what if kids remember that 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.050
 it's before round 10 so good what 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.120
 only thing that we have to do from 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.400
 now is to get the last 1000 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.620
 points and right now if it's going to come so 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.300
 we needed the key of the guard let's go 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
 to use it in this which is one of the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 pieces that we need when we are 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.310
 doing the achievement of nobody escapes 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.220
 alive and well there we are going to activate the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.050
 trap that is in that tower 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.270
 we use this box to knock us down and 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.580
 enter afterlife mode at the moment of 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.900
 do these guys are going to go running what 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.450
 faster than they can because this is from 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.700
 time and if they realize there is a 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.440
 voltmeter in the tower at the moment that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.950
 the electro we have closes in the 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.500
 door and the trap in this case the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.930
 sniper becomes a rocket trap 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 launcher and with these guys we have already 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.870
 used the three traps and used the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.540
 trap that is improved 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.069
 as you see the logo is very simple 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.659
 perform only a little bit of 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.950
 understand well what you decide to achieve and 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.379
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.239
 achievement of stuck in time if you have 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.310
 Any doubt some comment I hope that 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.590
 let me all all all 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.510
