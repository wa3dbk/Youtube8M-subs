00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of the way then on the side with the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
of the way then on the side with the
thick<00:01:08.010> hair<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
thick hair you are going to take a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
thick hair you are going to take a
little<00:01:10.380> piece<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.400> front<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> her<00:01:11.939> face

little piece right in front of her face
so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.650> probably<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so you can see it's probably about an

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
so you can see it's probably about an
inch<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> hair<00:01:15.950> comb<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:18.500> spray<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.710> down

inch of hair comb it out spray it down
again

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
again

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
again
so<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.030> damp<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.320> spray<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.680> rest<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
so it's damp and then spray the rest of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.890 
so it's damp and then spray the rest of
the<00:01:23.189> hair<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.659> free<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> flyaways<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
the hair so it is free of flyaways and

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.999 
the hair so it is free of flyaways and
then<00:01:27.900> you're<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> twist<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.970> hair

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
then you're going to twist the hair

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
then you're going to twist the hair
towards<00:01:32.009> her<00:01:32.400> head<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> pick

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
towards her head so that when you pick

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
towards her head so that when you pick
up<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.770> piece<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.189> hair<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:37.520> twists<00:01:38.520> under<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
up a piece of hair it twists under so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
up a piece of hair it twists under so
it's<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.079> gonna<00:01:40.320> fall<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
it's not gonna fall out and you just

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
it's not gonna fall out and you just
keep<00:01:45.360> wrapping<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> hair<00:01:46.170> until<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.619> run<00:01:46.979> out

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.000 

if<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.090> gets<00:01:55.300> messy<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.050> can<00:01:56.080> just<00:01:56.530> spray<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010
