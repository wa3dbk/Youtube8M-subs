00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
wood for the project that we're about to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
wood for the project that we're about to
commence<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> soar<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
commence so I'm just going to soar it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
commence so I'm just going to soar it
off<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.420> explain<00:00:52.170> what's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
off and then we're explain what's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:32.630 
off and then we're explain what's
happening<00:00:52.710> those<00:00:53.010> girls

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.870 

is<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> offending<00:01:34.240> article<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:36.550> next

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
is the offending article and the next

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.559 
is the offending article and the next
step<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:38.409> smuggle<00:01:39.159> these<00:01:39.420> watches<00:01:40.420> off

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
step is to smuggle these watches off

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.330 
step is to smuggle these watches off
whether<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.140> branches<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.679> growing<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.130> to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
whether the branches are growing and to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.160 
whether the branches are growing and to
peel<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> bark<00:01:42.819> off<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.840> need<00:01:44.050> an

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
peel the bark off so you need an

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.710 
peel the bark off so you need an
appropriate<00:01:44.440> sharp<00:01:45.210> blade<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.539> some

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
appropriate sharp blade of some

this is an old meat cleaver which
hopefully<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:52.000> job

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.270 

right<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.349> move<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.709> vice<00:02:16.950> now

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
right you can see up move to vice now

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.940 
right you can see up move to vice now
that<00:02:17.970> holds<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.750> firmer<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.830> more

position<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.700> blade<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.330> we<00:02:22.200> like

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
position with the blade and we like

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.380 
position with the blade and we like
safety<00:02:22.830> first<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.549> best<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.909> hold<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.330> as

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
safety first so it's best to hold it as

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
safety first so it's best to hold it as
long<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.750> can

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310

complicated this is the easiest way I
found<00:04:29.169> drill<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.830> hole<00:04:30.060> not<00:04:31.060> too<00:04:31.270> big<00:04:31.540> about

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
found drill the hole not too big about

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.020 
found drill the hole not too big about
the<00:04:32.169> same<00:04:32.410> size<00:04:32.710> as<00:04:32.979> one<00:04:33.160> piece<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.669> an<00:04:33.760> elastic

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
the same size as one piece of an elastic

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.230 
the same size as one piece of an elastic
then<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.050> get<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> piece<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.650> cold<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.940> quite

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
then you get a piece of cold it's quite

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.940 
then you get a piece of cold it's quite
strong<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:37.720> not<00:04:37.870> too<00:04:38.080> thick<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.650> thread<00:04:38.919> it

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
strong but not too thick you thread it

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.969 
strong but not too thick you thread it
through<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.430> hole<00:04:39.700> into<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.660> loop<00:04:40.870> then<00:04:41.830> you

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
through the hole into a loop then you

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.360 
through the hole into a loop then you
get<00:04:42.160> hold<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.510> elastic<00:04:44.250> thread<00:04:45.250> it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
get hold of the elastic thread it

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.530 
get hold of the elastic thread it
through<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.790> loop<00:04:46.290> Bend<00:04:47.290> about<00:04:48.389> just<00:04:49.389> about

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
through the loop Bend about just about

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.360 
through the loop Bend about just about
as<00:04:49.810> much<00:04:50.020> as<00:04:50.080> will<00:04:50.440> go<00:04:50.590> through<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:52.060> wood<00:04:53.370> hold

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
as much as will go through the wood hold

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.070 
as much as will go through the wood hold

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
wrap the string around your hang simple

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.659 
wrap the string around your hang simple
as<00:05:04.930> that

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
as that

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.219

they<00:06:12.469> will<00:06:12.649> grow<00:06:12.889> tree<00:06:15.490> so<00:06:16.490> this<00:06:16.610> is<00:06:16.789> a<00:06:16.819> short

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:17.059 
they will grow tree so this is a short
