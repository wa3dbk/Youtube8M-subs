 box in Berlin 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.560
 still now I play here why 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.970
 beautiful carpet when we become one 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.210

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.390

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.000
 corner this is a new shelf 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.450

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.330

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.330
 drawer 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.870

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.180

 then it's harder and harder and so on 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.500

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.840

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.330
 short shaky in close-up 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.550
 because unfortunately, part of the video 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.110
 somehow the file could not read 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.800
 and of course I wanted you now 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.930

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.360
 but I'm interested in the books 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.630
 and then until next time 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.630
 shoots
