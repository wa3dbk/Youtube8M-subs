millimeter<00:02:14.769> lens<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.540> faster<00:02:16.959> at

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
millimeter lens you know I get faster at

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.240 
millimeter lens you know I get faster at
making<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.349> change<00:02:17.680> after<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.010> use<00:02:18.130> this

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
making that change after you use this

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.350 
making that change after you use this
quite<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.489> bit<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.849> just<00:02:19.060> gives<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
quite a bit but it just gives you a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.300 
quite a bit but it just gives you a
decent<00:02:20.050> place<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.380> your<00:02:20.530> lens<00:02:20.739> does<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.040> even

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
decent place so your lens does not even

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.920 
decent place so your lens does not even
have<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.670> sit<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:21.940> down<00:02:21.970> on<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.269> ground<00:02:22.569> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
have to sit it down on the ground and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.750 
have to sit it down on the ground and
search<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> cap<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.400> always<00:02:24.610> there

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
search for it the cap is always there

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.430 
search for it the cap is always there
because<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.269> velcro<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:26.110> makes<00:02:26.319> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
because it's on the velcro this makes it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.410 
because it's on the velcro this makes it
easy<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.739> switch<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.130> back<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.519> forth<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.269> I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
easy to switch this back and forth so I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.540 
easy to switch this back and forth so I
find<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.900> very<00:02:29.440> successful<00:02:29.860> system<00:02:30.370> for

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
find this a very successful system for

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.580 
find this a very successful system for
using<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.170> something<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.440> can

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
using and I think it's something you can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.870 
using and I think it's something you can
really<00:02:32.709> enjoy<00:02:32.950> using<00:02:33.220> if<00:02:33.489> you're<00:02:33.640> doing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880
