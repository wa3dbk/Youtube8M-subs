disgusting with one block high so it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.020 
disgusting with one block high so it
would<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.430> been<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.670> him

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
when the water would hit it would just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.030 
when the water would hit it would just
break<00:01:02.670> those<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> boat<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.500> like

Noah's<00:01:32.369> Ark<00:01:32.610> wasn't<00:01:33.060> anything<00:01:34.040> beautiful<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
Noah's Ark wasn't anything beautiful on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.749 
Noah's Ark wasn't anything beautiful on
the<00:01:35.610> inside<00:01:35.900> maybe<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.320> could<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> been<00:01:38.070> but

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the inside maybe it could have been but

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.600 
the inside maybe it could have been but
it's<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.329> very<00:01:40.170> unlikely<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.159> was<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it's very very unlikely that it was it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's very very unlikely that it was it
was<00:01:41.640> probably<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:43.009> wooden<00:01:44.009> shelves<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
was probably just wooden shelves of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360 
was probably just wooden shelves of

was<00:01:50.040> Ark<00:01:50.220> had<00:01:50.370> two<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> each<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.420> there's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
was Ark had two of each in so there's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
was Ark had two of each in so there's
two<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.870> each<00:01:52.050> anyone<00:01:52.260> there<00:01:52.700> um<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
two of each anyone there um this is the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
two of each anyone there um this is the
part<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> hardest<00:01:58.440> it<00:01:58.620> was<00:01:58.710> just

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
part that was the hardest it was just

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
part that was the hardest it was just
all<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.820> lighting<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> had<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> figure<00:02:00.870> out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
all this lighting I had to figure out

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
all this lighting I had to figure out
the<00:02:01.530> exact<00:02:01.890> area<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.430> lighting<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.970> put<00:02:04.010> like

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
the exact area of lighting and put like

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.620 
the exact area of lighting and put like
everywhere<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.970> there's<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:06.480> much

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
everywhere because there's so much

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.790 
everywhere because there's so much
darkness<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:08.190> should<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.210> put<00:02:09.930> lighting<00:02:10.710> on

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
darkness I should have put lighting on

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.350 
darkness I should have put lighting on
these<00:02:10.950> corners<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.700> didn't<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.060> guess<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
these corners but I didn't I guess I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.630 
these corners but I didn't I guess I
could<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.050> later<00:02:13.490> all<00:02:14.490> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
could just get to that later all the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.490 
could just get to that later all the
lighting<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.030> done<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.420> either<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.080> torch

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
lighting is done with either a torch

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.200 
lighting is done with either a torch
redstone<00:02:17.370> torch<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:18.030> these<00:02:18.330> lovers<00:02:23.210> nothing

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
redstone torch or these lovers nothing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.400 
redstone torch or these lovers nothing
complicated<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:24.930> all

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
complicated at all

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.590 
complicated at all
I<00:02:25.670> think<00:02:26.670> there's<00:02:26.790> some<00:02:26.940> lights<00:02:27.150> behind<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
I think there's some lights behind the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.180

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
things mmm getting tricky on me they

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.170 
things mmm getting tricky on me they
getting<00:05:00.150> tricky<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.780> me<00:05:01.340> but<00:05:02.340> as<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:03.030> was<00:05:03.120> saying

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
getting tricky on me but as I was saying

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.150 
getting tricky on me but as I was saying
they<00:05:03.990> would<00:05:04.110> have<00:05:04.199> been<00:05:04.289> spawned<00:05:04.650> all<00:05:04.860> over

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
they would have been spawned all over

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.350 
they would have been spawned all over
and<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.370> would<00:05:05.460> have<00:05:05.520> been<00:05:05.639> spoiling<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.120> top

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
and it would have been spoiling the top

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.020 
and it would have been spoiling the top
and<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.380> behind<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.370> rooms<00:05:08.699> they

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
and like the behind the rooms they

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.640 
and like the behind the rooms they
probably<00:05:09.780> should<00:05:09.990> show<00:05:10.139> you<00:05:10.199> that<00:05:10.289> so<00:05:10.530> you

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
they would have gone spawned all over

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.490 
they would have gone spawned all over
there<00:05:29.120> if<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.240> guys<00:05:30.330> thinks<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.780> thinks<00:05:31.289> if

improvements obviously this isn't

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.490 
improvements obviously this isn't
historically<00:05:46.830> correct<00:05:47.099> with<00:05:47.900> Noah's<00:05:48.900> Ark

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
historically correct with Noah's Ark

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.529 
historically correct with Noah's Ark
because<00:05:50.599> there<00:05:51.599> is<00:05:51.720> redstone<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.530> there<00:05:52.740> and

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
because there is redstone in there and

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.969 
because there is redstone in there and
powered<00:05:54.539> lamps<00:05:55.139> I<00:05:55.349> don't<00:05:55.560> think<00:05:55.740> he<00:05:55.860> had

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
powered lamps I don't think he had

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.779 
powered lamps I don't think he had
powered<00:05:56.370> lamps<00:05:56.849> he<00:05:57.389> had<00:05:57.510> torches<00:05:58.139> I<00:05:58.320> would<00:05:58.530> say

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
powered lamps he had torches I would say

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.170 
powered lamps he had torches I would say
he<00:05:59.789> had<00:05:59.880> torches<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.639> think<00:06:02.729> that's<00:06:03.000> about

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
he had torches so I think that's about

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.240 
he had torches so I think that's about
