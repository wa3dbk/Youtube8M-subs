00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.810
 And then, how are you doing today? 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.330
 boxing 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.440
 rings that came to me today is the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 box attack 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.500
 I bought from the martins bookstore sources and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 is a mission that has long been six 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 books is technology itself and they only 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 an edition that I wanted very much 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.020
 tse time the selection was exhausted 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 This issue here is an issue that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.579
 they say I see around the internet I do not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.079
 I know if it's true to leave too, not too 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.690
 I looked for a very thorough research on 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.820
 There but say these houses here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.300
 they were drawn by the tone itself 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 than in the first edition when it is then there 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 good guys okay box 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.059
 I already wanted my Lord of the Rings there 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.589
 long since the time of the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 movies release 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.329
 I remember that at the municipal library 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.809
 in my city had the book and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.909
 single volume that was still film cover 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.090
 balance or sleep only that at the time 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.580
 I was afraid to face the book is I 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 had already put the hobbit before in this 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 edit that is slightly different in cover 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 hard 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 cute is all illustrated association 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.400
 here now but finally the iveco colored 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.660
 on some maps of us the actual images 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.730
 cool but anyway is very good says 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.560
 edit here and then probably I 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.780
 I'll cut your part off by opening the box 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.230
 can lower both sampled 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.750
 cutting the water from the box is at last the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.800
 Here the obvious is the box with 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.480
 many difficulties but opens good 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.370
 conquer the three points 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.670
 It's the goiÃ¡s I go until now you guys think 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.670
 that there 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.060
 sending is not bookmark is 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.870
 You need a lot of it did not return to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 order is the first book is the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.870
 Ring reminding society that tell 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 which are not hardcover, this staff is a 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.569
 cover if my well reinforced cardboard well 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 thicker than the hardcover but 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.250
 she on the more malleable cover so the tank 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.140
 I even like these issues until 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.190
 because it has more to what hardcover 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 same 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:42.200
 so here's a clap for knowing that he 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.709
 has no station at all 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.709
 of this 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.940
 Well, I thought it was okay. 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:01.340
 on tape 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:03.459
 ok maybe two towers too and if it contains 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.459
 a map 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:15.620
 so do not talk the photo here on the touch 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.780
 military also the return of the king 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 I think there is one more cut in the house 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.109
 beautiful here both of us 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.079
 then the one who thinks this whole thing will end 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.989
 also the society the ring society to 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:32.359
 plate I think it 's the hood older 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:40.040
 many should stay here as well 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:43.069
 cover also the same thing as 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.000
 the others nothing different 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.850
 I am what I thought the return of the king 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.660
 It's bigger but it's thicker than the book. 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:00.079
 ring society your personal team is 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.630
 have the same size as robert rivers so 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.329
 It's just to show you and me. 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.639
 I'll fight and I'll start this way. 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.240
 that descended to have in that list that has here 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.830
 I finished delivery 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.410
 but I will not take too long even coli 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.200
 It's a promise I made to myself. 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.050
 even so one of the rings is here so 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.750
 personal is the video for the 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.990
