00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.330
 Road traffic noise poses for wide 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 parts of the population seriously 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.610
 widespread health hazard 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.880
 is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 the cost of sound isolation 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.410
 noise barriers and health services 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.810
 the authorities are currently carrying one of the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.619
 most efficient and cost effective 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.109
 solutions for the reduction of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.510
 traffic noise is cars with quiet tires 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.210
 equip 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 In Europe, tires must 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 comply with emissions standards and before 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.610
 there is a type-examination 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.140
 the dutch examining authority rdw 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 runs a test track for mature 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 Noise measurements is a bumper with test 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.360
 tires and drives to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 Test track along the route 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 installed microphones take the tire 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 therefore on the when driving one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 Standardized asphalt track is created 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 the test is made by a mess stand 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.660
 controlled and recorded the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.859
 technician in mesz booth monitors the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.239
 incoming data and the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.689
 speed with the car 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.790
 passes between the microphones 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.040
 the instruments register the tips 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 the at the level that is the maximum 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.770
 noise level when the car is the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.540
 Microphones happened because engine noise 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 tire would interfere with noise measurement 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.759
 the driver shuts off the engine 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 before he reaches the microphones and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.590
 then drive past them as soon as that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 Car is out of range of the microphones 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.680
 He starts the engine again for everyone 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.310
 The measurements are taken eight times 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.890
 repeated 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.040
 to get accurate and consistent results too 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.040
 receive 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 Two types of tires are tested 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.470
 a standard tire and a low noise or 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 quietly mature, according to official 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.420
 Type examination causes the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 standard tire noise emissions of 74 5 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 decibel the standard tire becomes at 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 light gray vehicle mounted driver and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 technicians remain in contact 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.010
 make sure the car is the one 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.380
 80-kilometer microphones 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.700
 happens 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.670
 The driver turns onto the test track 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.140
 and turned off the engine so that only becomes 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.860
 the mature noise from the microphones 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 recorded this test results for the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 standard tires 74 7 decibels in the minimum 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.350
 deviation from 0 2 decibel proves the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.300
 high reliability of different 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.480
 tests and now the quietly mature the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.030
 official type examination resulted in 68 3 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.510
 decidable, therefore, more than five decibels 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 less than the standard tire these 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.550
 Low-noise tires are being added 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.550
 dark gray car mounted the decibel 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.650
 scale is logarithmic that is three 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.650
 decibel less means halving 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.480
 the noise level drops by five 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.850
 decibel corresponds to a noise reduction 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 by two thirds 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.420
 as with the standard reference tires 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.520
 agree with the results of the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.680
 type testing and this test measurement 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.209
 very good match 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.220
 the difference between the standard 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.080
 mature and the quieter tire 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.030
 well over 5 decibels 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.489
 the impressive lowering of the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.500
 Noise levels means that the tires of the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.150
 dark gray cars just a third so 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.570
 cause a lot of noise like that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.340
 standard tires of the light gray car with 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.110
 other words a car with 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.550
 standard tires cause the same amount 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.410
 Noise like three cars with low noise tires 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.700
 to prove this changed the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.010
 technician the attitudes of the 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.260
 instruments and monitors another 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.209
 reading now we can enter 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.290
 passing car with three 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.640
 Compare passing cars 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.160
 At first, the standard tire will be renewed 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.810
 tested and the pass is bekele 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.120
 for a period of one second 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.650
 converted 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.420
 at the standard tire the result is 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.520
 with this method 74 8 decibel 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.110
 then the three dark gray cars 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.780
 with different types of quieter ones 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.300
 tires stocked the official eu 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.350
 test results are all at least five 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.640
 decibel quieter than the standard tire 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.530
 they drive so close succession 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.320
 between the microphones soaked 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.090
 Safety allows the mature noise 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.940
 All three of these cars will be on 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.450
 one second converted the result 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.780
 is 74 5 decibels for all three together 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 for comparison with the car with the standard 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.900
 tires were measured 74 8 decibels 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.600
 So we see that on the street three 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.910
 cars with low noise tires in about 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.350
 have the same noise level as a 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.240
 car with a set of standard tires though 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.970
 low noise tires are as safe as 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.430
 standard tires stretch tests and 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.630
 Experience from practice shows that 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.669
 quietly ripen without 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.220
 Designing security losses and 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.169
 to let produce 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.940
 as proof, wet brake tests are included 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.050
 all four previously on the noise test 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.330
 tire types involved 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 First the type of tire is tested 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.020
 of the four at the European 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.890
 type testing the longest wet braking distance 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.890
 had expelled 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.259
 He is one of the quiet types you could 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.430
 suspect that the others have a shorter one 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.430
 show brake way 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.940
 the next one is the louder one 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.159
 standard tires in the official 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.470
 European test fall short of all 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.849
 four tire types the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.389
 minimum requirements of at least 20 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.490
 percent 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.490
 that means they are all very safe 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.470
 Contrary to expectations , the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.870
 standard tires have a slightly longer bough 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.310
 brake way on the cones are on the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.470
 Performances of standard tire 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.210
 reset to see if the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.030
 quieter tires can keep up 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.340
 The test will be quiet with the first sentence 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:02.159
 Tires repeatedly for reliability 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.159
 of the first safety test 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.710
 These quieter tires cut again 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.430
 Good off and the result will be with bowling 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.090
 now follows two more quieter 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.090
 mature guys 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.490
 all quieter tire types turn out to be 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.670
 in grip tests on wet roadways 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.950
 even better than the standard tire 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.420
 This practical example shows that it 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.250
 No compromise on tires or tires 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.940
 there is a connection between noise and 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.860
 security 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.110
 the quieter tires can be compared 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.690
 to standard tires just as safe or 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.000
 be even safer by five decibels 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.770
 quiet tires are already available 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.110
 old tires could be next 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.180
 due change without problems and 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.310
 cost-effective by noise on mature 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.160
 to be replaced the road traffic noise 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.990
 could be lowered by two thirds what 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.260
 in about the removal of seven of 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.720
 ten cars could be that easy 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.400
 at least 210 million victims of 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.870
 Road traffic noise in Europe 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.970
 relief 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.420
 quiet tires provide an efficient 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.040
 fast and cost-effective option 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.300
 to protect their health and theirs 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.300
 improve the quality of life
