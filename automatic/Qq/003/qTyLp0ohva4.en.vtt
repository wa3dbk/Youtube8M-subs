00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.320
 Hello everyone 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.140
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.490
 to maintain his nails after 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.460
 a second pause here it goes better 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.039
 like that puts you so blue pressure 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.409
 mans actually me I removed the gel that 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.839
 I had on the nails using a 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.640
 nail file type like this with 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.849
 a grain still quite thick and a 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 finer grain when we come close to 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.470
 the nail and so the next step after 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.130
 have removed all or the gel it's from 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.860
 to pass a block like these ones so we 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.500
 found mostly, especially 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.220
 start the websites or even in 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.190
 shop 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.400
 here to polish the nails and I'm going 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.850
 serve me in fact both sides the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 the smoother in fact so the one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.310
 which is the least smooth of the two I'm going 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.060
 use in the first place for it actually 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.179
 put there often not really limay but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.429
 to try to make the surface of 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:22.179
 the nail really smoother so here 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.909
 I check here to the touch already we have 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:29.109
 has something already two of very 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.210
 different to the touch and then so I 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:36.280
 I'll finally apply I'm going to rub 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.689
 with the party so luce 30 or there I 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.170
 going to actually make shine a 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.170
 good angle 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:52.100
 I do not forget the sides here so 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.590
 already I see the difference is then 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.220
 so I will apply products 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.750
 like this one so here it is 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 only a UV protection for 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.320
 nails but I also 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.880
 wait for me to find him here I have 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.870
 also this kind of product that is 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.650
 practically finished which is the so the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.570
 calcium product of peggy wise 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.540
 I also have different hardener varnishes 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.930
 so here I am I I I advocate rather 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.550
 the hardener this one there he did it 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.710
 his time he is a little too thick he 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.020
 gives more really much about the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.750
 nails so suddenly as for now 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.120
 I have this one and I find it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 well enough here I am going to apply the one 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:47.980
 there I apply of course toulouse 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:59.630
 without forgetting the bottom if we have them 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 long nails I'll wait for that 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 dry and then and then suddenly I 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.600
 if you're going to make bets 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.250
 point 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.630
 here and then I'll wait for it 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.750
 dry you apply a second 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.880
 layer 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.270
 so here I applied my second 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.209
 layer of the live protect coup de 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.680
 at peggy wise and suddenly I will come 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.970
 implicated her from him criticism hull 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.560
 So here's this one going to nuts 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.770
 coconut 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.990
 it's my favorite of the moment 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.170
 in any case she is very very good 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.560
 and I'm going to come applied on 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.910
 the entire nail and even below 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 history of doing things well 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.040
 that's the whole outline of the nail because 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.890
 that a break of frost it still remains 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.230
 something that goes that goes anyway 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.670
 come attack the nail even though it's very 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.670
 well done, here we go 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:17.580
 that's the important thing that's good 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:20.100
 take care of it after that once 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:26.270
 blow I applied my oil for 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:28.620
 cuticles i'm going to come massaged my finger 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.950
 in order to properly penetrate him the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.950
 cuticle 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.000
 that's after what I advocate so 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.280
 it's nice to really apply 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.500
 a hardener rather than there the protect 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.000
 light that I especially that all the more 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.280
 we do not really realize it as 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.580
 that but it is a little tinted alone at 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.560
 peggy wise to blow even in the light 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.720
 black for example that makes it to 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.980
 make the nails fluorescent so the 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.270
 sure some colors it can be 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.220
 nice for people who go in 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.700
 nightclub or for me you do not know 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.900
 too much the case so suddenly this is it 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.390
 because I did not say six o'clock 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.180

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.800

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.780
 will come to apply a co2 rate 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.850
 from above to try to harden them a 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.500
 little bit and especially I'm going to do very 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.950

 length finally that I appreciate a lot
