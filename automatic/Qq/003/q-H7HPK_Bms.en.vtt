in<00:01:53.010> front<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.580> we're<00:01:53.670> gonna<00:01:53.760> come<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
in front here so we're gonna come up the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
in front here so we're gonna come up the
the<00:01:54.510> shallow<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.530> over<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> top<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the shallow up over the top and down the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.800 
the shallow up over the top and down the
back<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> hopefully<00:01:57.180> there's<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.510> couple<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
back and hopefully there's a couple of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.800 
back and hopefully there's a couple of
fish<00:01:57.990> sitting<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.619> well

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.240 

cast<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.399> current<00:02:05.880> let<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> sink<00:02:06.869> down

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.470 

once<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> hits<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.849> start<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.209> slow

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
once it hits we just start that slow

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.330 
once it hits we just start that slow
retrieve<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.319> again<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.860> swimming

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
retrieve and again it's just swimming

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.800 
retrieve and again it's just swimming
right<00:02:14.489> along<00:02:14.790> near<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> bottom<00:02:15.630> with<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
right along near the bottom with a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.360 
right along near the bottom with a
striped<00:02:16.140> bass<00:02:16.319> are<00:02:16.560> sitting<00:02:16.890> waiting<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
striped bass are sitting waiting for the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.510 
striped bass are sitting waiting for the
bait<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> come<00:02:18.090> by<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.690> ambush<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.820 

you<00:02:26.210> can<00:02:26.360> use<00:02:26.480> different<00:02:26.690> size<00:02:26.930> heads<00:02:27.500> for

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
you can use different size heads for

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.190 
you can use different size heads for
these<00:02:27.920> situations<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.000> sluggos<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.960> find

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
these situations with the sluggos I find

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.470 
these situations with the sluggos I find
the<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.470> ounce<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.430> areas<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.150> fish

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
the one ounce in the areas that I fish

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.790 
the one ounce in the areas that I fish
generally<00:02:32.780> work<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.600> just<00:02:36.350> heavy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
generally work well I like it just heavy

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.040 
generally work well I like it just heavy
enough<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.280> tick<00:02:37.490> bottom<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.210> as<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> tide

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
enough to tick bottom and as the tide

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.260 
enough to tick bottom and as the tide
with<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.800> slow<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.190> as<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.460> tide<00:02:40.670> increase<00:02:41.150> or

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
with the slow go as the tide increase or

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.300 
with the slow go as the tide increase or
the<00:02:41.330> current<00:02:41.660> increases<00:02:42.230> I'll<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.190> adjust

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the current increases I'll just adjust

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.250 
the current increases I'll just adjust
how<00:02:43.730> far<00:02:44.030> up<00:02:44.240> current<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.720> cast

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
how far up current I cast

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.930 
how far up current I cast
I'm<00:02:45.590> always<00:02:45.740> casting<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.310> little<00:02:46.490> further<00:02:46.670> out

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I'm always casting a little further out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.460 
I'm always casting a little further out
a<00:02:46.970> little<00:02:47.210> closer<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.780> working<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.140> entire

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
a little closer in working the entire

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.070 
a little closer in working the entire
stretch<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.070> water

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.130 

so<00:02:56.680> next<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.910> buck<00:02:58.420> tail<00:02:58.660> jig<00:02:58.960> with<00:02:59.110> a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
so next up is a buck tail jig with a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.400 
so next up is a buck tail jig with a
trailer<00:02:59.650> trailer<00:03:00.150> I'll<00:03:01.150> carry<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.630> range<00:03:02.080> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
trailer trailer I'll carry a range of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.860 
trailer trailer I'll carry a range of
sizes<00:03:02.650> from<00:03:03.310> three-quarters<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.150> an<00:03:04.360> ounce<00:03:04.480> up

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
sizes from three-quarters of an ounce up

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.230 
sizes from three-quarters of an ounce up
to<00:03:05.110> two<00:03:05.410> maybe<00:03:05.680> two<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.100> half<00:03:06.280> ounces<00:03:06.520> and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
to two maybe two and a half ounces and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.020 
to two maybe two and a half ounces and
I'll<00:03:07.600> change<00:03:08.320> sizes<00:03:09.310> depending<00:03:09.550> on<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
I'll change sizes depending on the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.450 
I'll change sizes depending on the
current<00:03:10.300> flow<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:11.800> can<00:03:11.830> go<00:03:12.040> with<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> lighter

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
current flow you can go with the lighter

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.490 
current flow you can go with the lighter
jig<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.480> got<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.690> work<00:03:13.810> at<00:03:13.960> up<00:03:14.110> current<00:03:14.470> a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
jig you got to work at up current a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.140 
jig you got to work at up current a
little<00:03:14.710> bit<00:03:14.830> more<00:03:15.010> cast<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.490> up<00:03:15.610> current<00:03:15.970> more

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
little bit more cast it up current more

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.530 
little bit more cast it up current more
in<00:03:16.570> order<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> men<00:03:17.320> 10<00:03:17.770> bottom<00:03:18.160> better<00:03:18.540> right

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
in order to men 10 bottom better right

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.730 
in order to men 10 bottom better right
now<00:03:19.660> I'm<00:03:19.750> going<00:03:19.900> with<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.350> out<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:20.650> we're

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
now I'm going with a one out so we're

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.930 
now I'm going with a one out so we're
gonna<00:03:20.800> throw<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> up<00:03:21.280> current<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> little<00:03:21.850> bit

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
gonna throw it up current a little bit

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.480 
gonna throw it up current a little bit
of<00:03:22.030> weighs<00:03:22.270> difference<00:03:23.230> between<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.950> buck<00:03:24.220> tail

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
of weighs difference between a buck tail

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.570 
of weighs difference between a buck tail
jig<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.120> let's<00:03:25.480> say<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.080> rubber<00:03:27.010> bait<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.310> was

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
jig and let's say the rubber bait I was

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.340 
jig and let's say the rubber bait I was
throwing<00:03:27.790> before<00:03:28.210> provides<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.020> little<00:03:29.230> bit

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
throwing before provides a little bit

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.820 
throwing before provides a little bit
wider<00:03:29.620> profile<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.960> peanut<00:03:32.500> bumper

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
wider profile so with the peanut bumper

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.430 
wider profile so with the peanut bumper
that<00:03:32.950> are<00:03:33.100> around<00:03:33.400> or<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.180> mullet<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.410> a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
that are around or the mullet just a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.780 
that are around or the mullet just a
little<00:03:35.650> better<00:03:36.060> simulating<00:03:37.060> those<00:03:37.210> bait<00:03:37.570> fish

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
little better simulating those bait fish

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.890 
little better simulating those bait fish
but<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:39.850> still<00:03:40.000> do<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.210> same<00:03:40.390> basic<00:03:40.600> thing

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
but we still do the same basic thing

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.560 
but we still do the same basic thing
we're<00:03:41.050> gonna<00:03:41.170> cast<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.650> current<00:03:45.360> hits<00:03:46.360> just

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
we're gonna cast up current hits just

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.880 
we're gonna cast up current hits just
let<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.900> sink<00:03:47.170> down<00:03:47.440> until<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.890> hits<00:03:47.920> bottom

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
let it sink down until it hits bottom

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.560 
let it sink down until it hits bottom
once<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.070> there<00:03:51.340> it's<00:03:51.520> just<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.820> slow<00:03:52.150> steady

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
once it's there it's just a slow steady

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.280 
once it's there it's just a slow steady
swim<00:03:53.850> tail<00:03:54.850> that's<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.390> back<00:03:55.630> basically

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
swim tail that's on the back basically

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.900 
swim tail that's on the back basically
gives<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.650> all<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.890> action<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.430> want<00:03:57.730> you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
gives it all the action that I want you

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.730 
gives it all the action that I want you

what I tried to do is vary my caste

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.950 
what I tried to do is vary my caste
distance<00:04:20.609> I'll<00:04:21.609> cast<00:04:21.910> across<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.509> channel

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
distance I'll cast across the channel

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.360 
distance I'll cast across the channel
I'll<00:04:23.139> do<00:04:23.319> short<00:04:23.710> I'll<00:04:23.919> throw<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> little

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
I'll do short I'll throw a little

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.760 
I'll do short I'll throw a little
further<00:04:24.639> up<00:04:24.940> current<00:04:25.449> a<00:04:25.509> little<00:04:25.720> less<00:04:25.990> up<00:04:26.229> that

further up current a little less up that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.890 
further up current a little less up that
way<00:04:26.889> you're<00:04:27.069> covering<00:04:27.610> every<00:04:28.210> square<00:04:28.539> inch<00:04:28.780> at

way you're covering every square inch at

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.689 
way you're covering every square inch at
the<00:04:28.930> bottom<00:04:29.020> hopefully<00:04:29.889> finding<00:04:30.280> those<00:04:30.460> fish

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
the bottom hopefully finding those fish

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.040 
the bottom hopefully finding those fish
they're<00:04:30.910> sitting<00:04:31.210> down<00:04:31.360> there<00:04:31.569> in<00:04:31.720> front<00:04:31.900> of

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
they're sitting down there in front of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.570 
they're sitting down there in front of
you<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.889> one<00:04:33.009> I'm<00:04:33.099> gonna<00:04:33.220> work<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.520> a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
you so this one I'm gonna work it a

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.770 
you so this one I'm gonna work it a
little<00:04:33.789> bit<00:04:33.910> closer<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.599> little

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
little bit closer just a little

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.900 
little bit closer just a little
underhand<00:04:35.229> flip<00:04:35.349> I<00:04:35.830> find<00:04:36.639> doing<00:04:36.759> the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
underhand flip I find doing the

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.550 
underhand flip I find doing the
underhand<00:04:37.330> cast<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.780> lot<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:37.990> times<00:04:38.199> helped<00:04:38.440> me

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
underhand cast a lot of times helped me

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.740 
underhand cast a lot of times helped me
it<00:04:38.680> helps<00:04:38.889> me<00:04:39.069> to<00:04:39.250> stay<00:04:39.310> closer<00:04:40.000> as<00:04:40.300> opposed<00:04:40.630> to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
it helps me to stay closer as opposed to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.110 
it helps me to stay closer as opposed to
always<00:04:41.199> casting<00:04:41.680> far<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.610> make<00:04:42.789> sure<00:04:42.970> that

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
always casting far I can make sure that

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.909 
always casting far I can make sure that
I<00:04:43.180> work<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.660> water<00:04:43.900> at<00:04:44.169> my<00:04:44.380> feet<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.800> lot

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
I work that water at my feet and a lot

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.800 
I work that water at my feet and a lot
of<00:04:44.949> times<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.639> fish<00:04:45.849> are<00:04:46.000> lying<00:04:46.240> right<00:04:46.660> up

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
of times the fish are lying right up

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.270 
of times the fish are lying right up
against<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.289> edge<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.710> walls<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.190> these

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
against the edge of the walls of these

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:57.390 
against the edge of the walls of these
channels<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:56.470> can't<00:04:56.740> achieve<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.190> same

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
channels you can't achieve the same

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.129 
channels you can't achieve the same
thing<00:04:57.639> with<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.880> overhand<00:04:58.300> cast<00:04:58.599> but<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.930> find

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
thing with the overhand cast but I find

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.260 
thing with the overhand cast but I find
it's<00:04:59.289> just<00:04:59.409> a<00:04:59.470> little<00:04:59.650> easier<00:04:59.830> personally<00:05:00.699> to

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
it's just a little easier personally to

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.149 
it's just a little easier personally to
make<00:05:01.599> sure<00:05:01.810> that<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.259> shorter<00:05:02.710> cast<00:05:02.949> by

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
make sure that I do the shorter cast by

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.469 
make sure that I do the shorter cast by
doing<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.520> little<00:05:03.669> underhand<00:05:04.120> flip<00:05:06.479> the

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
doing that little underhand flip the

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.360 
doing that little underhand flip the
same<00:05:07.720> thing<00:05:07.990> cast<00:05:08.319> it<00:05:08.500> up<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.800> hit<00:05:08.919> bottom<00:05:09.130> and

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
same thing cast it up it hit bottom and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.939 
same thing cast it up it hit bottom and
we're<00:05:09.520> swinging<00:05:09.849> it<00:05:09.940> right<00:05:10.120> back<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.800> hits

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
we're swinging it right back in the hits

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.600 
we're swinging it right back in the hits
can<00:05:12.130> really<00:05:12.340> come<00:05:12.520> any<00:05:12.729> time<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.210> retrieve

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
can really come any time in the retrieve

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.890 
can really come any time in the retrieve
you<00:05:15.610> can<00:05:15.759> get<00:05:15.909> a<00:05:15.940> hit<00:05:16.120> while<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.419> sinking

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
you can get a hit while it's sinking

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.659 
you can get a hit while it's sinking
while<00:05:17.380> it's<00:05:17.530> swinging<00:05:17.800> while<00:05:18.220> it<00:05:18.340> gets<00:05:18.490> in

straight retrieve set the hook there we
go<00:05:33.009> we're<00:05:33.159> swinging<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.610> back<00:05:33.789> down<00:05:34.090> again

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.749 

adding<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.409> little<00:05:38.620> little<00:05:39.219> something<00:05:39.610> every

once in a while here but for the most
part<00:05:41.259> it's<00:05:41.560> just<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.830> straight<00:05:42.130> swim<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.610> that

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
part it's just a straight swim in that

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.959 
part it's just a straight swim in that
tail<00:05:43.289> that<00:05:44.289> might<00:05:44.469> have<00:05:44.590> been<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.710> hit<00:05:44.979> again

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969

tail that might have been a hit again
set<00:05:46.240> up<00:05:46.360> on<00:05:46.479> everything<00:05:47.009> but<00:05:48.009> that<00:05:48.159> tail<00:05:48.340> is
