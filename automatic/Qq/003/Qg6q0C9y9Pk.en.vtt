00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.810
 yes I'm sad tostedter I have her 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.370
 because of the room she called 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.690
 I know what they said I know what 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.650
 My mother 18 years ago on the fifth 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.050
 March said which is the sixth 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.030
 noble gas what they said they were 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.869
 scientist is the sixth noble gas 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.690
 So what radon is it a question 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:34.620
 or your answers 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:39.640
 a question the answer 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.210
 next question or pkv so that the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 tricky so the original series before the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.020
 next generation but picafort kirk 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.540
 correct that was already the first hurdle 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.970
 for the roommate creates the allowed 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.070
 enter 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.070
 that's pretty generous 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.660
 the bedrooms are probably 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 That's what counts 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.700
 is because their existence of conditions 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 no but no possibility 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.850
 its existence is perceived by it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.220
 depending on whether they are the second and third 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 hurdle master 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.720
 s3 any more demanding than that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 previous sit down 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 no, there I am 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.000
 what is the difference this chair is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.650
 ideally located both in relation to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 heat source in winter as well 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.460
 fresh air flow in the summer he stands 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.810
 also directly to the tv so this one 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.310
 Angle is allowed me in that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.900
 deepen or program-a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.760
 player without me talking through 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.350
 that's the reason why 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.800
 me this place for all times 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.440
 You may also have reserved 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.670
 category 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:05.479
 this is not a chair for my my 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.080
 so they said on the phone that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:14.000
 your field of study physics is yes 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.910
 experimentalphysics what is that? 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.890
 they do not matter to you every day 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.540
 university drive you and you have one 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 vehicle a car yes and you would me 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.690
 they can not drive with them either 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:33.350
 I can already do not want it 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.700
 I do not turn can receive that 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.660
 is a point was in my favor 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.310
 leave me the evaluator 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.200
 That was just a question last in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.820
 a postapocalyptic world which 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680
 task would be the highest priority 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.180
 to arrange the search for one 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.770
 renewable food source 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 Restoring a government of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.900
 reproduction or preservation of the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.130
 human knowledge for me it would be 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.760
 preserving the knowledge that is correct 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.200
 However, I would have every answer 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.470
 accepted apart from the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470
 procreation 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.390
 come see me show the rest of you 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.140
 Apartment too well I have the hurdles 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.880
 mastered 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.900
 they will not become the second one 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:23.100
 cocky that's the bathroom is the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.100
 defecate regularly 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.010
 it does not matter if you only appreciate it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.800
 the wan empty your darminhalt 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.120
 I had to have a little if you have to 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.630
 I'm sorry I do not rent 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.630
 substantially 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.800
 for time in the morning so around 88 can 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.070
 they do not have them I give them seven 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.790
 should be good then 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.320
 third hurdle they have mastered 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.320
 quite attained to see the room 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.530
 this is no my room is not 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.550
 human that my room they enter 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.320
 sleep your book the question is 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.660
 because no one can go in as they 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.170
 but a human are they are one 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.799
 human or not just a little one 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:27.080
 joke 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:29.650
 she often says that to her more often 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.650
 room 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.710
 they are allowed to paint it over
