00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.490
 Good people, Leandro Branches the website 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 teacher let's buy one more point 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 video where windows 2012 serves the video 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 class today I want to show you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.779
 how to create a reservation on your server 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 dhcp we have already learned the first 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 video how to install and configure the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 scope and agassi service penalty 2012 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.230
 serva if you do not think video is just 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.060
 click on that image that appeared in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 you will be redirected to the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 first class that addresses this issue the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 which is a reservation in some 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.500
 moments inside the company 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.390
 you need that certain 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 certain workstations 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.809
 computers or printers or 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 network equipment has an ip is fixed 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.079
 always that p 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 but if you set it on hand you will 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.739
 have a very administrative effort. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.820
 big will give you a headache will get 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.620
 that every time you format the machine 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 put that little arm 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.309
 This will give you work so you can 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 do the following tied up your server 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.220
 dhcp that certain mec always goes 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.640
 receive from your given dhcp ip 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 then you will set ip there in dhpp 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.909
 ensuring that that season that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.220
 network equipment has always received the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.119
 same address and the procedure 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.759
 simple 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 Come on, I'll open my servant here. 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:29.850
 2012 I'm going to go here on my server 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:36.210
 dhcp government itself the dhpp it is already in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.700
 and here in my scope I 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 I can see in active concessions and see that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.229
 I have three situations here picking up is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 ip 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.939
 at that moment on the server and the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 are ip 192 168 0 50 per month and 2 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 192 168 0 15 for ps3 and 192 168 0 200 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 to the pc1 my address could go 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.969
 deliver ip 250 to 200 with the exception of 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.439
 160 total 165 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.080
 so I want, for example, what 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.099
 station picks up the ipê 170 to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.870
 first thing i have to do 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.180
 to discover mac address what the market 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.590
 physical address of the network card 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.349
 address does not change because it has been crashing 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.150
 on the network card of that 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.810
 equipment at the station 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.120
 to discover this in the equipment 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.280
 you can see the manual or med you had 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 on the equipment itself in the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.700
 computers are very yes, I you, here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.239
 any season 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.640
 for example if the windows 7 April to oms 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:49.930
 of liking the command and pp with fini 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:54.030
 and you may observe that the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.760
 physical machine address 00 15 5 of 0 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.879
 06 50 so that address written in 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.470
 hexadecimal value or values from 0 to 9 and 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.540
 of the f1 and the first three digits is a 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.569
 manufacturer's code and the last three 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.280
 digit sequential number one this 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.829
 address as your chance of a car 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 when the car is manufactured that chances 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.250
 receives a numbering 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.109
 when this network card was manufactured 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.419
 did not receive this denomination then you 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.090
 You will notice this numbering coming back here pro 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.440
 my 2012 servant 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.019
 I can also see if the numbering in 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.840
 active awards such as pec2 he 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.639
 shows that any unique identification 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.129
 mac address this machine as I will 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:43.329
 want this reservation come here reservation come 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:47.169
 here in the new action menu reserve the name 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.799
 for this reservation for example windows 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.799
 7 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.320
 I'll put the Ipe 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:04.960
 lines leads to her 10 170 inside the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:15.460
 number can have a mac of this 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:17.790
 machine 00 15 5 of 100 6 505 boston com 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.790
 a description 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.120
 types allowed i'll leave both 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 add close then I have one 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.000
 booking here 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.169
 the next time that station he 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.740
 ask me p 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.550
 he will always take p 170 here in 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.160
 accounts for the note is that the reservation 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.100
 here came 170 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.410
 the description is reservation is inactive 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.740
 I will now force the station because it 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.020
 procedure occurs the man who in the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.930
 station with windows 7 and I'll be 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.090
 first command ip config bar milesi 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.240
 for the machine to deconfigure sp that 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.770
 she had beauty released sp 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.440
 and now the ip config bar command 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.270
 renew the concession and that is to say 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.280
 perform that procedure again 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.729
 I explained in the first videotape 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.349
 which is the dhcp brush of hcp off of 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.539
 ufpr quest dhcp sk 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:34.729
 he requested the server ip again 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:37.310
 dhcp the dhcp server has to check that 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.680
 that mec is already in reserve 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.680
 enabled and send me the ipê 170 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:55.400
 so he received 192 168 0 175 back 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:58.340
 here for my dhcp server should 5 for 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.570
 update here we like booking now 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.400
 is active 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.190
 we went another way to make reservation 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.550
 the machine is already getting ip here 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.090
 on my server here eg pc3 eu 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:18.889
 I'll give you a nei right and add the 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.460
 reserve converted with this 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:25.430
 to reserve what happened 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:30.470
 he has already created a reservation for me that 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.240
 always pick up this pa-151 in the 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.789
 first time I did manually seeing 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.180
 here in reservations and now I 've come here 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.449
 in the active concession and 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.900
 I was running on a reservation 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:50.000
 then this machine with this mech 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.770
 here you will always take the sp 15 Tahi one 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.930
