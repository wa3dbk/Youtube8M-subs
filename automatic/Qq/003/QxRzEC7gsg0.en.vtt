very<00:04:33.360> difficult<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:34.310> little<00:04:35.310> bonus<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:36.000> that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
very difficult a little bonus is that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.360 
very difficult a little bonus is that
this<00:04:36.540> fabric<00:04:37.050> tends<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.530> grow<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> little<00:04:38.100> bit

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370

this fabric tends to grow a little bit
in<00:04:38.520> width<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.810> be<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.020> little<00:04:40.380> more<00:04:40.650> deeply

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
in width and to be a little more deeply

difference<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.790> not<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.300> noticeable<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:46.170> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
difference is not that noticeable to the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.180 
difference is not that noticeable to the
eye<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.630> texture<00:04:48.630> gives<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.770> fabric
