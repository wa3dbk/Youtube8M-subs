00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello tankers with you slims obernik 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.070
 Today's issue we have a review of the Soviet 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.379
 heavy tank sixth level kv-2 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.230
 you know friends I have a small 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.630
 feeling sad that it's late enough 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.539
 I took this beautiful tanchik 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.210
 I missed the best in times because 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.490
 Quite recently - 2 with his devil 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.890
 tube loaded with gold shells 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.169
 brought a rustle to the whole random and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.820
 competent platoon of three square-2 in general 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.060
 distributed vanshot 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.850
 left and right by the way says more 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.670
 there used to be some kind of separation and then 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.340
 to you at all was just a mega cool bend 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.580
 car but unfortunately at that time 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.190
 slim in general did not play in the tank but not the essence 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 at the moment kv-2 still remains 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.660
 in my hangar 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.340
 sometimes I have a great desire 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.860
 roll it out randomly with your devil 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.110
 pipe kv-2 and at the moment not bad 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.110
 feels top of the list with sixes 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 Yes, and at the bottom of the list getting to the eight 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.780
 KV -2 will not leave anyone without damage 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.119
 It's clear that not everything is so simple kv-2 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.060
 quite addicted tanchik of course 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.490
 we need living allies to be 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.429
 guard and help KV-2 when he leaves 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.069
 on the wildest long kd which is 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.079
 about 20 seconds understandably 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.600
 play play carefully from some 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.880
 shelter where are we going to hide when 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.069
 it will be necessary to recharge so 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.679
 it turned out and in this fight is understandable 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:36.229
 that I drove to the right flank so 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.149
 say peck st chic because there is armor 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.049
 less damage respectively 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.880
 more 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.100
 on damage by the way I did it 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.909
 bout all I'm good enough nastrelyal 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.009
 more than eight and in principle 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.679
 got honored master but not the essence 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's go back all the same to our 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.609
 review 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.979
 and as usual we begin it with the story kv-2 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.139
 This is a Soviet heavy assault tank. 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.450
 the initial period of the great patriotic 

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:05.509
 war abbreviation apt-2 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.340
 means komente and voroshilov official 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.660
 the name of the serial Soviet heavy 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 1939 tank release 43 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.010
 years this machine was designed 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.210
 Design Bureau of Leningrad 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.540
 Kirov factory 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.300
 January 1940 due to acute 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.580
 the need for well-defended tanks 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.720
 with powerful weapons to combat 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.610
 falsifications 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.820
 mannerheim lines during 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 Soviet-Finnish War of 1939 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.710
 the forties a month later whom 2 was 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.890
 officially adopted and 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.860
 mass produced until July 41 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.620
 the reason for withdrawal was 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.470
 started the great patriotic war 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.020
 a total of 200 four tanks were produced 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.480
 KV-2 which were actively used in 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.690
 fighting and ferb 1 year and then 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.670
 almost all were lost in the game 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.790
 kv-2 as we said 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.640
 Tanchik is not lost 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.160
 his chip is of course 150 two 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.490
 millimeter achieve which can 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.340
 give out just awesome amount 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.580
 damages but understandably this is a weapon 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.910
 we are not the only one you have a choice 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.050
 Basically, you can try it in the role 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.270
 conventional tank with conventional 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.630
 but no less chips then in this 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.400
 case you do not feel the benefits 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.400
 I would like to highlight 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.530
 y-2 due to its 150 two 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.480
 millimeter cannon he can 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.810
 guaranteed to damage any 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.970
 the enemy machine we have is useful as 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.890
 at the bottom and at the top of the team list 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.680
 principle, this will be clearly 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.650
 shows quite specific 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.960
 the gameplay is a lot like me including 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.660
 find this car really quite 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.450
 fanovaya quite simple pumping 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.670
 cars to top condition is all 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.600
 pros and cons we are and of course 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.890
 same weak armor bad review 150 two 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.650
 millimeter aha curl 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.950
 It has a long overcharging large scatter 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.200
 and the time information the instrument goes down 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.360
 only 5 degrees 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.120
 because of the large silhouette and visibility 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.380
 forced to rely on shelter like 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.570
 it was said before 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.930
 slow speed at 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.330
 whom 2 is only 35 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.010
 kilometers but now a few words about 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.690
 tactics in the gameplay itself first 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.030
 all would advise to climb on a construction site 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.310
 disable head-ons and assault by playing 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.860
 KV-2 you do not need them if you 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.690
 chose gun 107 millimeter sys-6 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.970
 are you any special so are you here too 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.500
 no, because kv-2 turns into ordinary 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.540
 heavy i think most of you 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.310
 agree with me what to buy apt-2 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.940
 playing with a gun here six is ​​just 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.790
 blasphemy 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.770
 After all, the main feature of the KV-2 is 150 2 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.290
 millimeter howitzer requiring 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.120
 a kind of tactics and should 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.710
 immediately warn that the most 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.780
 this tool will be comfortable when 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.800
 one hundred percent crews and extra 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.200
 equipment 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.960
 car demanding hands otherwise you 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.290
 risk being useless for yourself 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.960
 so for our team with the gun m10 we 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.800
 in fact south tower of a no armor 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.530
 and kpk 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.720
 but without an artillery sight, but 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.800
 we have sniper our element 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.260
 this melee left came down zhahnuli 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.020
 and in the shelter to recharge on the open 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.660
 places without much need do not climb bad 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.070
 review and great silhouette works against 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.110
 us so that not 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.870
 be a single shot tank try 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.730
 strike and when the enemy is distracted or 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.130
 until he can answer you 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.920
 looks the other side recharges and 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.170
 so on good idea would be help 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.020
 great uncles fight against yourself 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.880
 similar if the enemy is engaged in a shootout and 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.190
 simply does not have the ability 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.110
 switch on you can put 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.740
 decent damage and substantially help 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.830
 team 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.570
 the main thing is not to substitute a blow for 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.090
 opponents of the seventh level and above 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.140
 disassemble you with two three shots not 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.780
 straining 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.090
 land mines is the easiest and most reliable 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.980
 choice for this gun thanks 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.380
 large caliber damage passes 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.570
 almost always and with considerable 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.060
 however, remember that on the mechanics of the game 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.100
 full damage from landmine will take place only when 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.200
 breaking through in this case at eighty 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.720
 six millimeters for non penetration damage 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.520
 immediately cut twice plus extra 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.590
 depending on thickness 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.980
 armor that is hitting a machine gun nest 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.530
 ball bots 3 4 we can deal damage to him 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.140
 up to 1000 units and hitting the gun mask 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.300
 only about 300 so when 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.170
 opportunities aim places with the most 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.080
 thin armor 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.380
 also advantages of land mines include 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.830
 that they are good at criticizing modules and crew 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.290
 armor-piercing shells have low 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.520
 armor penetration but then inflict 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.590
 big damage 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.110
 tool 10 can be used from 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.330
 long distance main shoot when 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.230
 complete information, although here as a matter of fact 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.460
 roulette 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.910
 even with 400 meters or more you can get 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.520
 do the whites of the eyes along the moving target 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.160
 anticipation and remember that 150 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.130
 two millise explosive has splash 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.560
 even if it is not very big but for example 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.590
 stop the firefly hitting the ground nearby 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.660
 with him and knock down the caterpillar we can 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.780
 the same reason, shoots completely at close range 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.120
 you shouldn't hurt yourself if you 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.160
 hit the top do not rush forward 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.870
 head proceed carefully 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.690
 don't forget to leave the shelter on 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.730
 recharge and don't go alone 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.870
 an experienced enemy can take advantage of your 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.930
 long recharge 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.849
 and by spoiling your life on this from me 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.009
 everything with you was slam collects
