00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.390
 I show you 85 between the screen skirt 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.630
 white 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.540
 and we already cleaned the concealer 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.160
 we already change display and exit screen 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.660
 white yet then what are we going to 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.120
 to do is that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.700
 let's review or look for a map of 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 of a display of 80 and 50 that I have 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.050
 one that can not happen to edit at 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.010
 computer and let's take the readings 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.870
 of if we do not have a master's degree like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 this one that indicates a watercolor the 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.800
 track that is our voltage manual 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.980
 we have to get us a reader of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 to be able to measure the voltages 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 required to be sending you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.330
 let's start making here the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.760
 voltages and this track here has to 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.410
 have it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.109
 well here we are going to take first 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.720
 readings with the magister and here he says 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.440
 that a high voltage is coming 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.170
 I like a value here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 here we see that here they usually have 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 that arrive 26 fallen back detects us 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.430
 and all these chips above is not 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.800
 they have reading d 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.270
 let's say of a high voltage 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.229
 that's why here shows the eve that is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 low voltage 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.020
 but when the first form 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 we see as it shows a reading a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.350
 voltage here we continue with the earth 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.570
 there we see that it matters high because this 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.330
 It has 2.8 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.760
 here we see that it shows us a voltage h 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.070
 of high drops 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.340
 here is 1.8 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.979
 and after that the first one would have to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.800
 show a voltage value and in this 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.410
 case is not showing anything the second 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.350
 it is land from there because from above 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.090
 third if it has 1.88 the fourth has 1 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.570
 point within the tour at 15 has a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 point sun that and the sixth has 1 point 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.780
 Soles and those on the side were 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.630
 they go to the controllers so they do not 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.480
 generate no voltage reading 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.330
 it is like this our love such that is 1.8 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.900
 Holidays the last shows 2.8 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.910
 as we see in the review the only one that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.310
 is not giving us any reading any 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.890
 value is the first should have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 1.8 the one that would have the capital as in 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 this one that takes out and we're going to see with him 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 with the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.290
 with the voltage reading multimeter 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.140
 and let's see how much voltage is 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.130
 reaching each bread and here we see that there 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.130
 26 volts 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.400
 which is the required to be able to illuminate 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.220
 the leds that's why using white screen 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.440
 they mean that in a problem leds and 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.340
 here we use the reading of 2.8 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.150
 here we see that there are 1.7 and we start from 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.120
 the first 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.159
 I do not like any value 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.920
 no reading the second is earth 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.010
 but now if we see that the third one has 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.960
 1 point of 39 1.8 volts the fourth 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.460
 as well 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.720
 the fifth also and the sixth also 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.270
 they mean that the problem is in the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.190
 first track is not sending 1.8 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.640
 volts and that the pizza that you have to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.600
 repair 3 let's look at helpful 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.580
 scratch the plane so you can look at 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.620
 where it takes us to the track and be able to do 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.620
 a bridge if it is necessary to do it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.270
 we have already been able to make the bridge and see 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.640
 as it gives us an image 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.130
 that we were able to get the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.260
 required voltage that was 1.8 volts 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.580
 to enable already see it in the image 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.580
 and let's see 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.010
 later we no longer arrive 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.990
 the 1.8 high and that here already shows 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.389
 a value 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.389
 when we can 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.430
 already shows us a high voltage that are 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.870
 1.8 and let's see 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.870
 the voltage reading 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.650
 and there we see 1 point of 39 votes like 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.689
 that others 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.820
 lines that have that same value 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:07.390
 What we have been able to do is that we did 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.950
 we looked at the line where it was taking us 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.950
 where this plan took us 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.659
 where does this line take us that is not 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.129
 reaching the voltage and realized 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.129
 that has to do with a controller 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:27.250
 send that voltage and it comes out of the processor 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.350
 and it was these areas that we see here where 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.030
 is the only driver of this the 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.600
 display here the other three are in 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.370
 this area and from there it was our turn to do 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.220
 a procedure to the soldering iron since it is 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.009
 coated with the resin remove the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.250
 resin very delicately and usually it 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.380
 will join the tracks and from there withdraw the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.360
 controller and make the bridge in this 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.080
 case then I simply work with the 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.570
 necessary bridge because the other two 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.330
 other points that bring or not I did 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.039
 source and work normally however 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.849
 there is no more you can do all the 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.720
 full bridges 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.150
 and the one we're going to see 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.550
 then like 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.450
 we could do this here we see the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.300
 image to use it better here we see 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.070
 that the controller the pizza that does not 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.910
 was working was the first of 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.620
 up that goes this red driver that 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.980
 I have it points low in the plane 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.530
 service and it's the first contact that 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.360
 it has to do with this kind line 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.849
 be 1.8 volts 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.639
 what we did was remove it and then 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.460
 make the bridge to the line and be able 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.710
 solve and there we see as we have already 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.270
 could give service solution to boot 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.229
 professional technical service in 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.229
 mobile phone
