world of military watches you've got
some<00:01:41.920> very<00:01:42.130> interesting<00:01:42.219> brands<00:01:43.209> I<00:01:43.359> think<00:01:44.079> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
some very interesting brands I think the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.230 
some very interesting brands I think the
one<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.740> kind<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.249> really<00:01:45.579> know<00:01:45.729> is<00:01:45.939> the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
one that we kind of really know is the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.919 
one that we kind of really know is the
Tudor<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.069> Tudor<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.880> men's<00:01:49.149> issued

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
Tudor these are the Tudor a men's issued

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.319 
Tudor these are the Tudor a men's issued
mainly<00:01:50.590> from<00:01:51.569> 1973<00:01:52.569> through<00:01:53.229> 83<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.609> earlier

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
mainly from 1973 through 83 the earlier

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.639 
mainly from 1973 through 83 the earlier
ones<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.959> 74<00:01:56.859> ones<00:01:57.209> would<00:01:58.209> be<00:01:58.239> with<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.439> black

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
ones the 74 ones would be with the black

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.929 
ones the 74 ones would be with the black
dial<00:02:00.039> which<00:02:00.609> was<00:02:01.329> later<00:02:01.599> replaced<00:02:02.079> by<00:02:02.499> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
dial which was later replaced by the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.960 
dial which was later replaced by the
blue<00:02:03.939> dials<00:02:04.450> blue<00:02:04.840> dials<00:02:05.289> seem<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.799> be<00:02:05.919> more

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
blue dials blue dials seem to be more

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.920 
blue dials blue dials seem to be more
fondant<00:02:07.420> because<00:02:07.660> they<00:02:08.619> were<00:02:08.680> less<00:02:09.340> prone<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
fondant because they were less prone to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.260 
fondant because they were less prone to
condensation<00:02:11.160> having<00:02:12.160> said<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.000> a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
condensation having said that this is a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.160 
condensation having said that this is a
later<00:02:13.540> Black<00:02:14.460> 183<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.840> know<00:02:16.960> they<00:02:17.140> are

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
later Black 183 so you know they are

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.800 
later Black 183 so you know they are
they<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.770> around<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.490> with<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.940> maxi

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
they are around but it's with the maxi

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.530 
they are around but it's with the maxi
plot<00:02:20.050> dial<00:02:20.590> now<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.580> all<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.820> them<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.210> think<00:02:22.420> my

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
plot dial now of all of them I think my

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
plot dial now of all of them I think my
favorite<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.050> probably<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.680> one<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> black

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
favorite is probably this one the black

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.610 
favorite is probably this one the black
one<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> early<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.240> because<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.900> it's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
one the early one because it's just it's

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.640 
one the early one because it's just it's
