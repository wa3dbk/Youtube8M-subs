about global warming is an issue that my

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.330 
about global warming is an issue that my
administration<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.770> concerned

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
about deeply deeply in a deep kind of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.149 
about deeply deeply in a deep kind of
concerned<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.860> uh<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.810> don't<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.200> start<00:01:20.040> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
day and I think about the warming of the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
day and I think about the warming of the
globe<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.490> how<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> warmer

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

God rest assured that the issue of
global<00:01:28.740> warming<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.460> something<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> my

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
global warming is something that my

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.280 
global warming is something that my
administration<00:01:30.860> takes<00:01:31.860> very<00:01:31.950> seriously<00:01:32.130> the
