00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello this is my first video lesson and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.069
 today I want to show you how to remove 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.679
 or change windows password it works 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.040
 in all window versions of windows to us 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.789
 I checked only on 7 let's first 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.240
 create a password control panel 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.240
 account 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.640
 choose a user about changes by 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.660
 district give it change your current password 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:40.200
 there was such a fish 9 we introduce a new 123 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 123 here from 1 to 3 digits 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 close now we need an image 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.610
 Disk link to this image I throw in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 description of the video because you write it down 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 on the pig but what way will 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.750
 do i did like this so here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.500
 choose this image and now we need 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 to restart a computer 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.150
 here we press enter for loading with 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.150
 this disk 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.380
 the interface here is pretty simple three languages 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.680
 English German Russian and so 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.690
 reset change password select 1 she 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.570
 automatic costs but to find out 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.490
 password, you can choose the second 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.229
 in principle it is possible but it is very 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.570
 long this program will work 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.180
 let's go back to the beginning here we choose 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.530
 reset or change further here it is 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.570
 automatically fills 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.390
 now we need to select a user 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.820
 to which we want to remove the password or 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.479
 change if you want to delete something 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.030
 just press reset immediately and if 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:08.420
 want to change enter here new 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.150
 password 123456789 0 and click well 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.450
 reset change this one button i don't 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.769
 I will create a file and everything is now possible 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.820
 press exit reboot wait while she 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.560
 boot principle know the password you can 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.690
 but it will be a lot of time 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 just takes microsoft very well 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.090
 bother with it and somehow it 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.230
 you just need to guess it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 loading windows 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 Well, for example, enter the old password 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:09.870
 there from 1 to 3 3 does not fit and now 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:14.200
 enter all numbers 3 4 6 7 8 9 0 okay 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 see it works it was my first lesson
