 Hello and welcome dear viewers to the second 3d graphics card 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.680
 Wiese's test clarifies in the last issue we presented him among others 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.759
 the 3d graphics card from Elser before the test results at that time was not 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.790
 intoxicating meanwhile there is a beta-driver of parents with whom 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.410
 Most problems are fixed on the driver you can find on the Eldor CD 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 6 90 in the directory Peter if 95 Victory 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.439
 or on this CD in the program directory 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.640
 with the new pastor is running 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840
 with both the two megawatts and the four gigabyte version 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.310
 the Victory card 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.560
 the free sale begins 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.430
 Game for example, side effects even though this does not represent 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.440
 This also mirrors do not run on such optical gimmicks 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 renounce 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.650
 more too 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.710
 you just have to know more that you will find on this CD 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.010
 with the beta driver 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.700
 not a trace anymore 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.070
 in the old swimming pool 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.410
 for him too the map of Matrox is also in the last issue 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 not good way came 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.100
 We can now give the all - clear, they learn more in the test of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.550
 current issue 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.780
 A promising new development comes from Rocket 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.930
 The White Stripes marriage is a pure accelerator card without VGH features 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 she always needs an additional graphics card in the system via one 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.620
 Included cable will be the output of the normal video card with the input 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.240
 connected to the long shot card 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.250
 At the output of the widest 3d then the video cable of the monitor is infected 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 the long shots only active when games use the 3d functions 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.330
 with a clear building then the card turns off the normal VW has 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.890
 Porsche also internally 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.940
 Advantage of this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.940
 you do not have to go back to your old post and favorite color 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.760
 At around 90 frames per second, this card has also been one of the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.590
 fastest test candidates 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.840
 OcÃ© deeper to the card the customized full version of this 2 with 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.500
 Not only does Hans Penz enjoy it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.200
 With around 30 frames per second, you can not grasp super before the resolution 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 through the corridors 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.760
 The textures of the robots and walls are well filtered so no 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.890
 sharp pixels can be seen 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.710
 but the whole thing has its price with the full versions of Descent 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 2 and some sugar as well as several others play the card 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.420
 Expected to cost 500 marks 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.239
