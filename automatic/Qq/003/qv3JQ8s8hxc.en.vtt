how to make your own texture template I

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.519 
how to make your own texture template I
know<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:05.970> quite<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.330> bit<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.690> video<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:07.230> there

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
know it's quite a bit of video out there

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.839 
know it's quite a bit of video out there
everybody<00:00:08.069> get<00:00:08.550> their<00:00:08.849> own<00:00:09.110> way<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> doing<00:00:10.620> it

everybody get their own way to doing it
this<00:00:11.849> way<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.480> didn't<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.040> depends

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
this way I didn't see it it just depends

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
this way I didn't see it it just depends
how<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.639> put<00:00:15.000> your<00:00:15.179> layer<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.809> mini<00:00:16.049> layer

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
how you put your layer and a mini layer

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.310 
how you put your layer and a mini layer
you<00:00:16.680> put<00:00:17.270> what<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.510> did<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.340> use<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.990> paper<00:00:21.990> that

you put what I did I use the paper that
come<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> 12<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:24.390> 12

come in the back of are a 12 by 12
design<00:00:25.170> theory<00:00:25.769> paper<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
design theory paper and and like this I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.560 
design theory paper and and like this I
get<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> 1<00:00:29.939> inch<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.080> 3/4<00:00:31.890> inch<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.210> oh

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
get the 1 inch and the 3/4 inch and I oh

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
get the 1 inch and the 3/4 inch and I oh
my<00:00:34.350> oh<00:00:35.570> that's<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:40.079> layer<00:00:40.800> are

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
my oh that's like all my the layer are

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.270 
my oh that's like all my the layer are
to<00:00:41.879> everything<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.870> too<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> would<00:00:44.010> take

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
to everything it's too so I would take

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180 
to everything it's too so I would take
this<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:46.230> glue<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this and I would glue this with the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.350 
this and I would glue this with the
Tombo<00:00:47.899> multi-purpose<00:00:49.070> glue<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:51.329> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
Tombo multi-purpose glue and when you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490 
Tombo multi-purpose glue and when you
glue<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.160> make<00:00:53.160> sure<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.730> glue<00:00:54.059> off<00:00:54.500> all

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
glue it make sure you get glue off all

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.330 
glue it make sure you get glue off all
around<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:57.329> before<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.620> glue<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
around and then before you glue it on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.299 
around and then before you glue it on
your<00:00:59.550> board<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.239> say<00:01:00.930> lay<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.680> about

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
your board I would say lay it out about

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
your board I would say lay it out about
all<00:01:02.609> where<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.739> glue<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
all where you want it and then glue it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
all where you want it and then glue it
because<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> did<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because the first one I did it's this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.990 
because the first one I did it's this
one<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> mess<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
one and it was a mess and then I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
one and it was a mess and then I
couldn't<00:01:12.810> switch<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.680> half<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
couldn't switch it because half of it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
couldn't switch it because half of it
was<00:01:14.640> glue<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.869> sure<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.110> get

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
was glue so I would make sure you get

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
was glue so I would make sure you get
plenty<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.950> glue<00:01:17.220> didn't<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.090> glue<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
plenty of glue didn't put glue in the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.580 
plenty of glue didn't put glue in the
back<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> do

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
back and go there so now you know to do

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340 
back and go there so now you know to do
this<00:01:22.830> part<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.090> did<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.750> advance

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this part and I did it all in advance

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
this part and I did it all in advance
because<00:01:25.590> after<00:01:26.130> you're<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.030> make

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
because after you're going to do it make

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
because after you're going to do it make
sure<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> let<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.409> dry<00:01:28.979> completely<00:01:29.630> before<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
sure to let it dry completely before you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
sure to let it dry completely before you
pass<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.530> through<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.920> big<00:01:32.100> shot<00:01:32.159> because

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pass it through your big shot because

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
pass it through your big shot because
it's<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.509> roll<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.560> say

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it's all going to roll out I would say

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's all going to roll out I would say
do<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:34.979> today<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.610> tomorrow<00:01:36.500> pass<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.770> through

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
do it today and tomorrow pass it through

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.030 
do it today and tomorrow pass it through
your<00:01:38.189> big<00:01:38.400> shot<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.720> did<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> same<00:01:40.439> thing

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
your big shot and I did the same thing

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.370 
your big shot and I did the same thing
and<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> star<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.790> die

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
and with the star this is from the die

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
and with the star this is from the die
cut<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.860> die<00:01:47.490> let<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.240> big<00:01:48.509> shot

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
cut the the die let go in the big shot

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139 
cut the the die let go in the big shot
it's<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> number<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.820> like

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it's the one the number to get like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's the one the number to get like
three<00:01:51.509> different<00:01:51.659> size<00:01:52.200> star<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> it's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
three different size star and I you it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.830 
three different size star and I you it's
got<00:01:54.869> four<00:01:55.170> difference<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.000> size<00:01:57.000> star<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
got four difference that a size star and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.830 
got four difference that a size star and
I<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.979> small<00:01:59.729> medium<00:02:00.119> large<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.540> didn't

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
I use the small medium large I didn't

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.160 
I use the small medium large I didn't
use<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> bigger<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
use the bigger one and you see all the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
use the bigger one and you see all the
dirty<00:02:04.409> spot<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.159> that's<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> glue<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
dirty spot there that's the glue and I

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.999 
dirty spot there that's the glue and I
use<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.550> eraser<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.119> erase<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.440> but

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
use my eraser to erase a lot of it but

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.980 
use my eraser to erase a lot of it but
it's<00:02:11.190> still<00:02:11.370> some<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.030> there
