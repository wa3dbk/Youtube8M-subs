00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
this is the biggest point of contention

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.480 
this is the biggest point of contention
in<00:00:09.400> roofing<00:00:09.820> today<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.410> before<00:00:12.100> I<00:00:12.129> answer

that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.670 
that
couple<00:00:13.780> things<00:00:13.900> which<00:00:14.140> are<00:00:14.260> going<00:00:14.350> to<00:00:14.470> lead

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
couple things which are going to lead

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.050 
couple things which are going to lead
into<00:00:14.950> and<00:00:15.519> support<00:00:15.969> a<00:00:16.209> lot<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.940> lot<00:00:18.940> of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
into and support a lot of the a lot of

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.190 
into and support a lot of the a lot of
what<00:00:19.180> I'm<00:00:19.270> going<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.480> say<00:00:19.630> about<00:00:19.840> how<00:00:19.990> long

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
what I'm going to say about how long

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.359 
what I'm going to say about how long
he'll<00:00:20.560> only<00:00:20.770> last

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
he'll only last

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.240 
he'll only last
so<00:00:21.750> today<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.960> cedar<00:00:23.200> that<00:00:23.439> we<00:00:23.560> that<00:00:23.920> we<00:00:24.040> cut

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
so today the cedar that we that we cut

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.280 
so today the cedar that we that we cut
down<00:00:24.279> that<00:00:24.580> we<00:00:24.670> mill<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.360> very<00:00:25.750> very<00:00:25.960> young

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
down that we mill is very very young

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.359 
down that we mill is very very young
growth<00:00:26.950> so<00:00:27.460> it's<00:00:27.640> infant<00:00:28.180> growth<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:30.099> cedar

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
growth so it's infant growth the cedar

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.620 
growth so it's infant growth the cedar
and<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.500> we<00:00:33.010> start<00:00:33.310> out<00:00:33.460> today<00:00:33.790> at<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.360> grave

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
and so we start out today at a grave

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.069 
and so we start out today at a grave
disadvantage<00:00:35.430> over<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:37.329> folks<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:37.899> were

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
disadvantage over the folks that were

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.110 
disadvantage over the folks that were
strolling<00:00:38.590> sea<00:00:38.829> rules<00:00:39.100> in<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.460> 50s<00:00:39.880> in<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
strolling sea rules in the 50s in the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.819 
strolling sea rules in the 50s in the
sixties<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.720> seventies<00:00:40.750> eighties<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.829> so

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
sixties the seventies eighties and so

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.280 
sixties the seventies eighties and so
that<00:00:44.980> puts<00:00:45.160> us<00:00:45.280> at<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.430> disadvantage<00:00:46.290> so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
that puts us at a disadvantage so

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.600 
that puts us at a disadvantage so
there's<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.530> disadvantage<00:00:48.040> there<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.430> next

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
there's a disadvantage there the next

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.120 
there's a disadvantage there the next
thing<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.570> most<00:00:49.750> predominant<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.680> the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
thing is and the most predominant of the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.370 
thing is and the most predominant of the
offenses<00:00:52.000> I'll<00:00:52.180> call<00:00:52.420> them<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.020> way<00:00:53.200> that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
offenses I'll call them is the way that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
offenses I'll call them is the way that
the<00:00:53.530> cedar<00:00:53.770> is<00:00:54.070> installed<00:00:54.520> and<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.400> because

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
the cedar is installed and and because

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.210 
the cedar is installed and and because
because<00:00:58.090> largely<00:00:58.510> today<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.140> it's<00:00:59.440> it's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
because largely today it's it's it's

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.860 
because largely today it's it's it's
installed<00:01:00.730> in<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.970> deficient<00:01:01.450> matter<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:01.810> I'll

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
installed in a deficient matter and I'll

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.130 
installed in a deficient matter and I'll
give<00:01:02.020> you<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.200> reasons<00:01:02.530> why<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:02.950> minute

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
give you the reasons why in a minute

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
it depends on a lot of things and but I

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.629 
it depends on a lot of things and but I
would<00:03:24.130> say<00:03:24.400> no<00:03:25.209> less<00:03:25.480> than<00:03:25.690> 20<00:03:25.989> years<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.430> if
