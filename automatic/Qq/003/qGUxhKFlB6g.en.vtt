 I am a nutrition consultant and distributor 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.390
 independent of herbalife and today I 'm going 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.500
 Herbalife which is fiber is a product 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.500
 exclusive is this from here 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.010

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.689
 contraindication and is a blocker of 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.640
 fats without any effects 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.230
 secondary, unlike the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.450
 fat blockers that can 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.280
 others sell the pharmacy 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.580
 natural components that they carry when 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.300

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.930
 cellulose et cetera and well then in the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.989
 market there are many fibers but it is in 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.970
 concrete has the hiccup with is a fiber 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.090

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.300
