surface one thing I was skeptical about
was<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.710> clear<00:01:35.070> plastic<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
was the clear plastic on the back of the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
was the clear plastic on the back of the
case<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.110> luckily<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.770> wrong<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
case but luckily I was wrong and it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
case but luckily I was wrong and it
functions<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:39.180> well<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.869> extremely

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
functions very well as it is extremely

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
functions very well as it is extremely
hard<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.860> rigid<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.400> protects<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> glass

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
hard and rigid which protects the glass

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
hard and rigid which protects the glass
back<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> Nexus<00:01:43.079> 4<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.009> also<00:01:44.130> four

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
back of the Nexus 4 there are also four

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.520 
back of the Nexus 4 there are also four
small<00:01:45.030> plastic<00:01:45.329> feet<00:01:45.750> around<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.170> edge<00:01:46.259> which

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
small plastic feet around the edge which

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.530 
small plastic feet around the edge which
means<00:01:46.799> when<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> plastic<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> surface

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
means when the plastic is on the surface

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
means when the plastic is on the surface
it<00:01:48.899> isn't<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.320> touching<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> won't

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it isn't actually touching so it won't

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
it isn't actually touching so it won't
get<00:01:51.060> scratched<00:01:51.360> however<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.079> could<00:01:52.259> still<00:01:52.470> get

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
get scratched however it could still get

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
get scratched however it could still get
scratched<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> bag<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.909> thing<00:01:54.180> i<00:01:54.390> don't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
scratched in a bag one thing i don't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.840 
scratched in a bag one thing i don't
like<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:55.049> functionality<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.369> case<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
like about functionality of this case is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.120 
like about functionality of this case is
that<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.479> black<00:01:57.689> plastic<00:01:58.049> i<00:01:58.530> found<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> be

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that the black plastic i found to be

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.580 
that the black plastic i found to be
more<00:01:59.369> slippery<00:01:59.790> than<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.210> phone<00:02:00.420> itself<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
more slippery than the phone itself so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
more slippery than the phone itself so
if<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.070> more<00:02:02.340> robbery<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:03.149> even<00:02:03.689> had<00:02:03.960> more

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
if it was more robbery or even had more

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
if it was more robbery or even had more
of<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.439> texture<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> would<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> big

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of a texture that would be a big

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
of a texture that would be a big
improvement<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.540> looks<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:06.960> case<00:02:07.320> are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
improvement the looks of this case are

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.440 
improvement the looks of this case are
very<00:02:07.710> nice<00:02:07.950> first<00:02:08.489> glance<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.060> looks<00:02:09.300> like

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
very nice first glance it looks like

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
very nice first glance it looks like
that<00:02:09.569> isn't<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.020> case<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that isn't a case on it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
that isn't a case on it
if<00:02:11.069> only<00:02:11.280> making<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.849> look<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.450> packed

a place that I often see cases be let
down<00:02:31.409> as<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.920> buttons<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:33.120> usually

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
down as the buttons they are usually

down as the buttons they are usually
either<00:02:33.750> hard<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.379> access<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:35.099> too<00:02:35.430> mushy<00:02:35.700> but

either hard to access or too mushy but

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580 
either hard to access or too mushy but
these<00:02:36.209> protrude<00:02:36.599> enough<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.049> they<00:02:37.170> aren't<00:02:37.319> too

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
these protrude enough so they aren't too

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
these protrude enough so they aren't too
hard<00:02:37.859> to<00:02:38.040> click<00:02:38.340> also<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.299> nice<00:02:39.599> tactile

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
hard to click also have a nice tactile

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.860 
hard to click also have a nice tactile

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
feedback from the press one complaint I

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.050 
feedback from the press one complaint I
do<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.250> possibly<00:02:44.700> too

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
do have is that they are possibly too

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180 
do have is that they are possibly too
easy<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.599> click<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.379> found<00:02:46.590> myself<00:02:46.829> using
