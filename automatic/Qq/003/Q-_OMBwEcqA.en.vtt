I<00:02:23.209> don't<00:02:24.209> think<00:02:24.269> these<00:02:24.510> superstars<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.290> any

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I don't think these superstars have any

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.170 
I don't think these superstars have any
intention<00:02:26.189> of<00:02:26.250> taking<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.670> easy<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.030> each

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180

signed up for King and quite frankly I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.759

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
the fans to say they've never set foot

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.520 
the fans to say they've never set foot
inside<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.969> ring<00:02:38.299> no<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.019> they<00:02:39.109> spend<00:02:39.409> their
