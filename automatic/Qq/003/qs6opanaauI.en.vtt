00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.620

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.780
 back because they put days that 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.090
 stupidity because they put guides I do not know 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.709
 but it hit me with the same flange now 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.709
 I have already done as the guides 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.790
 the trees of the woodland 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.580
 I went to the first wooded area 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.320

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.690
 know and you will do 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.090
 methodology or they wanted to slow down the mango 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.489

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.489
 I have avoided your braking 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.760

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.720
