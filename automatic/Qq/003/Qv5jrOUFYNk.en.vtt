00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.660
 hello everyone this is today's video 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.390
 like every Friday I want to bring you videos 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.020
 out of ten arrived in the city and then 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:36.140
 let's see what for us is ok 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.519
 then the store is in the front 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.360
 to the speaker where he was during the first 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:47.839
 week of play and then we have a 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.650
 paraphernalia increase a leader in all 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.239
 for a long time now it was absurd 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.199
 that you're still there if you don't 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.110
 you will have to take it is one of the sacred and no 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.970
 it is not one of the most exotic is the armor 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.810
 strong for the Titan simply the most 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.450
 useful then hip hop I would say to merge 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.970
 take for the second titan actually 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.369
 then monkeys king of the alpha wolf crest of the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.860
 alpha wolf which is an armor for the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.360
 not the strongest hunter second 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.820
 me if you really want a piece for the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.560
 lucky raspberry chest is better too 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 why to revive i 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.390
 team mates got vaguely strong 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.070
 I don't know depends on the mode if you do ad 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 dp more example do skirmish there 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.700
 maybe it can be useful though 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.330
 still prefer other types of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.610
 exotic the for the hunter the helmets 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.650
 they are the exotic ones to use if you want 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.640
 or the arms if you like the skin 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.210
 like I do but that's another one 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600
 speech 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.650
 the lines of the empty bite he already had 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.390
 sold our emptiness that I am not 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.390
 bad they believe ours so you don't 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 I can guarantee 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.580
 but the ability allows you to re-enter 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 with 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.820
 with grenades ready and if you have a singer 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.880
 of the sun with two grenades you can be 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.130
 useful then the weapon for sale this 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.870
 week and last word 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.530
 we turn word that I had already reviewed 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.050
 long ago I sincerely hoped nejad al 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.500
 day in the lord of thunder in short 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.110
 something that I didn't feel right 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.380
 take the weapon yes and no the sense the rome 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.260
 it is beautiful and very beautiful in my opinion it is strong 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.290
 it depends on me depending on the situation 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.440
 so think again 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.900
 titan and you have strange coins 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.890
 count you will come in a non 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.330
 the last words much better 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.510
 the paraphernalia if you don't have it use 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.250
 obviously for the hunter must live 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.540
 resume losing the wolf's cemetery 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 alpha is not a serious loss for the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.840
 put the empty bite already sold them 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.060
 so I don't know 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.500
 you say yes I would take 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.330
 however the armor sincerely though 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.959
 instead you have all the last annuities 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 speech and have some fun doing do 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.489
 cowboy finally revels in exotic g for 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.049
 the helmet that I can't take because 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.720
 there were enough particles of light in 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.580
 how much I spent on emblems either 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.820
 stupid, however, I wanted environments 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.040
 so curiosity then telemetry for 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.560
 portable cannon pulse gun e 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.080
 I don't need any shotguns 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.910
 these fantastic emerald coil e 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.239
 vacuum thruster to enhance the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.710
 your goshawk if rare and heavy synthesis 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.040
 that I won't take it because 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.180
 lead to arrangements we see are 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.140
 already 21 even perfect so ok 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.480
 so this is the option of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.830
 week you feel you had to like it that is 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.010
 was useful the online vinegar that is 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.360
 subscribes tv in this video 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.280
 I will begin to put another at the end 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480
 of the video so maybe let me know 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.600

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.600
 Hello
