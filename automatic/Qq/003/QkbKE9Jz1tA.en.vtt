00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
definitely not labeling is because you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.599 
definitely not labeling is because you
know<00:00:56.070> those<00:00:56.219> pueblans<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:57.570> uh<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:58.489> don't<00:00:59.489> know

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
how to explain they call her the red

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160 
how to explain they call her the red
that<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> candy

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that they have it's it's like a candy

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
that they have it's it's like a candy
cane<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.680> reminds<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.360> being<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
cane it reminds me of like them being a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
cane it reminds me of like them being a
candy<00:01:07.049> cane<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.890> bright

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
candy cane because it's a very bright

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.070 
candy cane because it's a very bright
red<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:09.090> bright<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:11.390> he<00:01:12.390> could<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> sin

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
red very bright and up he could be a sin

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.670 
red very bright and up he could be a sin
alone<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.070> doubt<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:16.290> looks<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.590> a
