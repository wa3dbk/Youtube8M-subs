00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello dear viewers and welcome to one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.529
 new episode of my way to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 success we are going to start with our first 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.179
 contest with our barclays premier 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.429
 league series a higher team on while 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.929
 two begging striker from Belgium who left 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.269
 with breeze merckx of course and for the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 rest basically our whole team but erica 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 does a video start what i am 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.260
 ask if you like something or if the video 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.130
 can like it 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.320
 and for the people who wonder 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 why many youtubers ask all sides 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 if you can look like the video that has 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 actually a simple reason that is that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 if you like a video then others will 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.090
 also see that you will be the light then the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 video so say get more exposure 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.579
 I already speak crimes in my English language 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
 Dutch sentences 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.030
 when fall in jip and janneke language 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.710
 basically just means you us 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.239
 indirectly 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 that is how indirect support stood up 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.420
 don't like the video because then 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 it would be very grateful 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.160
 of course everything about the gameplay 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 Here we are scoring more dirty with 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.980
 chicken or am take i just forget it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.020
 as concert must be every time 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 pronounce cold enough and rant 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'm in that will not also leave a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 get a penalty and he will 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 fine shooting in the left corner because me 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 notice that keepers have a lot of trouble here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 have quitting arrow runs out 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.640
 like you with me is nonsense because he comes 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 also here yes he brings the score slightly 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 closer to the draw of course the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 that my goalkeeping is just completely wrong 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 the devil dives two directions cannot 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.890
 stop and finally how the sonic 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.630
 equal height 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.150
 So of course I want to come up with that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 we are not doing very well and me 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.790
 you go a header 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 is not going well but then he gives me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 finally heard what it actually was 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 must occur 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 We win the year is just 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.869
 that's it for playing around in the wat 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.890
 lower divisions 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.390
 watching was one of those people who 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.680
 give that kind of presents and it is 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 actually just an early one 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.250
 Sinterklaas to not leave we made 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.790
 here the five three one decisive 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.130
 contest 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 so with 5 3 inside what a great 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.210
 result is the meaning to be found for 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.630
 the match go again with us for it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.040
 team 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 and you see that some have changed 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
 i thought yes this link is not good with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.450
 Serina and I really liked sharing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.159
 very bad 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.899
 she entered the school for a full 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.909
 premier league team uses some players 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.890
 from my fitness team and then another one 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.450
 couple bought green in the kitchen and so 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.920
 what you've just seen if you have anything 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.299
 need more time then I stop there 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.740
 just the video 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.110
 we can also take a look but it is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.030
 actually a fairly basic series 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.099
 harbor buck jumped lectines like that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.290
 spectacular is not what starts out 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.939
 so very well that underwent 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.829
 everyone knows ring new all that guy 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.629
 he has even more sweat because wanted 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.310
 night sweatband so heaven will be fine 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.180
 in that shoot and der in one this all the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.069
 of deerlijk as we have of course 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.560
 our five and six plays on that and that 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.109
 did score a wild special 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.700
 advantage i was your head lukaku and lukaku 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.010
 that was called a base there is also 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 sometimes called lukaku as in the cow 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 of course and that runs and so just 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 plenty of oathkeeper and that cow had nothing 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.420
 but also to see you again 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.189
 free with lukaku and is already out of every 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.019
 decision to come one-on-one 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.889
 who shoots him very perfect complement to 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.180
 the keeper 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.920
 so what the shoes were actually with 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.260
 three one more the despite that early 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.329
 backlog what is green 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.280
 very cheap was also a thing 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.409
 say that or like you ask you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.840
 imagine you think guus hiddink 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.370
 from the orange team must be yes or no 100 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.530
 of course 6 out of past results 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.269
 really to write the house even though it says 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.200
 which is already what i get out of as well 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.540
 loss of latvia 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.220
 if i don't happen so scared yes 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.959
 I think salvation and performance are dirty 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.299
 so far not very much 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.489
 fantastic spectacular all the way 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.049
 seen yesterday magda is dead red 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.970
 slightly fantastic , I must say 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.250
 with really amazing how that guy at 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.829
 PSV to rap because he is really one 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.389
 wonder player that case so yes I think 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.190
 erased a bit without flash result 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.269
 disappointing completely in contrast with 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.530
 Louis van Gaal 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.060
 but what does the van lab but in the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.549
 reactions know I am very curious what 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.510
 you think about this subject and me 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.379
 maybe they had to come in for something 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.729
 discussion 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.440
 join and every now and then the kids 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.879
 answers you because I do read 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.590
 every comment some may think 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.930
 also they do not always read but I read 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.609
 principle always but i usually sit mine 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.139
 mobile and then a little crooked 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.340
 respond or clay them via mail 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.120
 for example and then I just can't 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.829
 respond 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.629
 but I read all of us so don't be 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.430
 scared I always just read your input 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.199
 vogue were those busy leather is going 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.819
 back the gameplay again and see it 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.430
 here with a bit more rosy what for ours 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.229
 side because lukaku proof is a value 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.510
 and i must say that the lukaku really 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.949
 is so much better than last year 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.479
 years as may follow wit must said 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.889
 plays it very sloppy 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.269
 more I find him, on the other hand, is very bad 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.370
 have fun playing and he is just super 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.799
 powerful that you definitely need in this 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.689
 year sure with tendon that is still competition 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.250
 we just play with us again 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.919
 bakery family team because of course 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.750
 plays never wanted you never range 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.250
 never change a winning team are both 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.430
 and so can stand the is 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.530
 opponent fc rex 84 knows for sure 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.480
 not bad of course with diego 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.650
 costa nerds probably the best 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.750
 striker from the game 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.890
 if you assume sweat and pies rating 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.330
 on fitness 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.190
 ok i empty air you get an arrow 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.870
 who and bed sign will just put it in 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.030
 Shooting well is lucky 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.890
 via the bottom of the bar my goals 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.810
 of course goals are always what 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.280
 a philosophical political among others 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.110
 with your Holland Mahatma image 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.240
 say gandhi and then say the cage 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.560
 van hamill just wasn't leaving 2 0 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.690
 and that's it 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.400
 she could hardly argue with anything 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.750
 so down to the atmosphere the three points 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.520
 home so I end it 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.650
 liked the episode about scoping 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.640
 I don't leave a like or huge 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.440
 so don't buy it new it can always be 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.450
 I can do me on twitter and instagram 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.350
 the left stand for the description, and to 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.680
 the four boys 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.680
 later on
