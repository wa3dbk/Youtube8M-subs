00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
brass it tends to thread in real nice so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
brass it tends to thread in real nice so
I'm<00:01:29.460> using<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> brass<00:01:30.060> nipples<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.659> stick

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I'm using the brass nipples that stick

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'm using the brass nipples that stick
out<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> 3/8<00:01:32.189> inch<00:01:32.400> air<00:01:33.150> line

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
out and then just a 3/8 inch air line

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080 
out and then just a 3/8 inch air line
and<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> connects<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> each<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and it connects to each one of them and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.410 
and it connects to each one of them and
then<00:01:36.960> those<00:01:37.200> lines<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.799> run<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> you'll

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
then those lines just run up and you'll

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
then those lines just run up and you'll
have<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> common<00:01:40.020> manifold<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
have a common manifold up here and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
have a common manifold up here and
that's<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.930> brass<00:01:43.170> nipples<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that's got three brass nipples also on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
that's got three brass nipples also on
it<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> half<00:01:45.509> inch<00:01:45.720> threaded<00:01:46.170> end

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it that's got a half inch threaded end

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.760 
it that's got a half inch threaded end
on<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.290> thread<00:01:49.590> any

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
on it that way you can thread any

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
on it that way you can thread any
half-inch<00:01:50.700> pipe<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:52.740> your

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
half-inch pipe right into that for your

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
half-inch pipe right into that for your
air<00:01:53.070> source<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> makes<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.170> nice

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
air source so that makes it pretty nice

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.850 
air source so that makes it pretty nice
that<00:01:56.399> way<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:57.170> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> mount<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.590> horns

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that way you can kind of mount the horns

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
that way you can kind of mount the horns
in<00:01:58.979> different<00:01:59.310> locations<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.479> feed<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
in different locations and just feed the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.770 
in different locations and just feed the
air<00:02:00.960> lines<00:02:01.200> into<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> set<00:02:03.630> up

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
air lines into them I'm going to set up

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
air lines into them I'm going to set up
back<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> try<00:02:05.070> these<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.520> yet

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
back here I'm going to try these out yet

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.819 
back here I'm going to try these out yet
all<00:02:06.390> hooked<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:06.960> we'll<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:07.710> they

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
all hooked up so we'll see what they

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:41.790 
all hooked up so we'll see what they
sound<00:02:08.039> like
