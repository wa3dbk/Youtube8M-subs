00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.670
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.939
 Today we will learn to customize clothespins. 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.260
 The materials that we will need are: paint, markers, brushes, a bit 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.040
 of lace and a pinza. 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.760
 We take the clamp in this way. 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.589
 We start by painting the clip in white. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.260
 And we also painted a small triangle, which will be the collar of the shirt. 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.260
 Now we paint the other part in black. 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.399
 Once we have dried the paint we go with the small details. 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 With the brown marker we will make the girl's hair. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 One part and the other. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.020
 We will also paint the back part. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.320
 With a red marker we will make the lips. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.760
 One part and the other. 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
 And now we only have to do the eyes. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.960
 Now we only have to put in the bottom 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.420
 a piece of blonda a little wrinkled that will make a tail. 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.060
 We stick it in the back. 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.450
 Thus. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.560
 When we have the tail, we take two more pieces of lace, we roll and fold 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.700
 a little 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.220
 And, in this way, we put glue on it. 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.360
 We hit it on the head. 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.280
 To make us the veil of the bride. 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.410
