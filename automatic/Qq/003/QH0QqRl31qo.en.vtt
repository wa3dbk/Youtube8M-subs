and<00:02:55.189> I<00:02:55.700> did<00:02:55.909> find<00:02:56.150> when<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.329> was<00:02:56.510> pulling<00:02:56.720> them

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
and I did find when I was pulling them

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.460 
and I did find when I was pulling them
up<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.650> where<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.879> had<00:02:59.269> whole<00:02:59.480> bunch<00:02:59.720> was

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
up that where I had whole bunch was

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.319 
up that where I had whole bunch was
where<00:03:01.069> there<00:03:01.189> was<00:03:01.310> nothing<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.760> front<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.209> it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
where there was nothing in front of it

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.470 
where there was nothing in front of it
so<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.590> plant<00:03:03.950> was<00:03:04.129> crowded<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:05.120> example

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
so if the plant was crowded for example

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.879 
so if the plant was crowded for example
some<00:03:05.629> of<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.750> gladiolas<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.439> right<00:03:06.590> next<00:03:06.739> to

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
some of the gladiolas was right next to

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.670 
some of the gladiolas was right next to
the<00:03:06.950> potatoes<00:03:07.430> then<00:03:07.939> the<00:03:08.329> crop<00:03:08.680> directly

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
the potatoes then the crop directly

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.890 
the potatoes then the crop directly
behind<00:03:09.919> the<00:03:10.250> gladiolas<00:03:10.730> was<00:03:10.909> smaller<00:03:11.389> I<00:03:11.599> got

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
behind the gladiolas was smaller I got

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.589 
behind the gladiolas was smaller I got
more<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.889> little<00:03:13.189> ones<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:14.030> only<00:03:14.269> one<00:03:14.450> or

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
more of the little ones and only one or

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.289 
more of the little ones and only one or
two<00:03:14.629> big<00:03:15.019> ones<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.430> tube<00:03:16.879> crowding

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
two big ones and so that tube crowding

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.289 
two big ones and so that tube crowding
isn't<00:03:17.569> gonna<00:03:17.659> work<00:03:17.889> but<00:03:18.889> next<00:03:19.189> year<00:03:19.579> I'm<00:03:20.060> going

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
isn't gonna work but next year I'm going

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.990 
isn't gonna work but next year I'm going
to<00:03:20.450> put<00:03:20.629> two<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:21.980> possibly<00:03:22.129> three<00:03:22.430> rows

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.170
