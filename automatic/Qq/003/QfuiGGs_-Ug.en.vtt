as<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:39.990> base<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> jet<00:01:40.770> ski<00:01:40.920> near<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
as I could base it up a jet ski near a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
as I could base it up a jet ski near a
beach<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:43.020> does<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> lifeguard<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
beach so it does have a lifeguard on the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649

to play it's gonna be on so next one

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.289 
to play it's gonna be on so next one
this<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.499> is<00:02:29.739> hunting<00:02:30.129> hunting<00:02:30.639> for<00:02:31.090> deer

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
this one is hunting hunting for deer

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.589 
this one is hunting hunting for deer
this<00:02:31.780> Palo<00:02:32.079> Duro<00:02:32.349> it's<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:32.920> battery<00:02:33.189> shot<00:02:33.599> one

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
this Palo Duro it's a battery shot one

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.229 
this Palo Duro it's a battery shot one
thing<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> note<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:35.469> wind<00:02:35.739> direction

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
thing to note you can see wind direction

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.879 
thing to note you can see wind direction
so<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.389> all<00:02:37.480> points<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.900> one<00:02:38.079> way<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.530> it's

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
so it's all points in one way and it's

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.770 
so it's all points in one way and it's
got<00:02:39.010> four<00:02:39.189> miles<00:02:39.400> per<00:02:39.579> hour<00:02:39.760> as<00:02:39.939> well<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.719> I'm

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
got four miles per hour as well so I'm

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.089 
got four miles per hour as well so I'm
guessing<00:02:41.049> it's<00:02:41.139> a<00:02:41.200> sort<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.409> angled<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.859> shot

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
guessing it's a sort of angled a shot

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.220 
guessing it's a sort of angled a shot
and<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.540> try<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.629> take<00:02:43.749> out<00:02:43.870> some<00:02:43.930> deer

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and just try and take out some deer

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
and just try and take out some deer
basically<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.099> probably<00:02:45.249> imagine<00:02:45.489> who's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
basically you can probably imagine who's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.059 
basically you can probably imagine who's
behind<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.269> gun<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:47.560> putting<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.769> be<00:02:47.859> Trevor
