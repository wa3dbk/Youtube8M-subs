00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:12.380
 Hi Hi It's a high sound Recently I made a blogger high with healthy blog . 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:20.980
 This is in addition to I muscle training has been in the blog going to write a lot of elements 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:23.260
 This time, I wrote a blog about how to make an abdominal muscle divided into six effectively in the training relationship with the muscles . 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 This is pretty 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.960
 I thought that it was a good work and I will introduce it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.280
 First of all, when trying to break the abdominal muscles, the body fat percentage is related 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 The body fat percentage for Placement in five stages the level edge 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.850
 Body fat percentage 19% or more 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.750
 Level 2 body fat percentage 15% to 18% 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 Level 3-year mortality rate 10% to 14% 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:03.950
 9% from Level 4 Lanapa Level 6 is less than 6% 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.950
 In fact there is individual difference in how to see in the amount of muscle muscles, but it seems to be this kind of indication as a rule 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.950
 So from the beginning 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.040
 Before you do your best to crunch, you need to bring your body fat percentage to level 2 first. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.390
 There is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:23.680
 For example, body fat percentage referred to in the case of 25% 30-year-old male 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.960
 I need 7% more words line bot auto 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.409
 I meal is simply the most effective thing is at this stage 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.020
 Choose food that is hard for one person and eat calories 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 Standard level last week is ok 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.950
 West fat to go in one month 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 23 percent fall asleep 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.530
 Meal is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.690
 So much influence 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.980
 Although I drop and after the 5% I large aperture 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 The most effective at this stage are weight training and aerobic exercise 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:06.440
 It is 23 months When you ask them to training confiscated three times 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:14.230
 I think I will visit body fat rate up to 18% 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.230
 If it is possible to commit this crime , it is better to look at the direct training of the wind fungus . 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.810
 So before you come to this group 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.220
 Even if I do abdominal training I hide in fat 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.930
 It means that the abdominal muscles can not be seen at all 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:34.140
 As we briefly summarized so far 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:37.400
 Diet management and weight training and aerobic exercise until the body fat percentage is 18% 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.739
 Please go for 23 months 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.470
 If your body fat percentage is 18% understood, then use ab workout training routine 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.680
 Please incorporate 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.730
 It is visible as clean cracking performed by performing the property as down if residual values decrease after guess body fat percentage 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.730
 It has become very 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.300
 A common failure example is 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.420
 I would like to manage food 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.850
 Suddenly when starting from abdominal training 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:13.190
 Of course I hide in the fat and I can not see it so I will give up on the way without seeing the results 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.190
 There are many patterns that it ends with medicine 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:21.760
 This picture was before when I broke my abs 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:27.550
 30 days, but did you say was taken every day 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.730
 It is a start from the body fat ratio 15% in the start stage new ground 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.810
 After that, it is a meal management ridge abs training 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.810
 I went by dividing the abdominal muscles 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:54.310
 If you come to a meeting on the 30th, it's broken quite clearly 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:59.280
 The body fat ratio is 7% when it is clearly broken 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.280
 It was about half because it was 15 at first 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:07.440
 Like me It's quite easy to break up your abdominal muscles when your body fat percentage is below 18% from the beginning 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:15.290
 I can do it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:18.979
 Or I generally think that people that age mortality It is those who want to split the abdominal muscles is equal to or more than 19% in many cases 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.500
 In this case weight training and aerobic exercise 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:26.770
 Because you must do it 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:31.320
 I think that considerable depression will drop out at this point 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:36.210
 And I say that because calm weight training and aerobic exercise 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:42.350
 If you try to lower the chair point, which was only for food management, you also get muscle 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.750
 As it decreases together, it will eventually rebound after a few months 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:51.500
 If I give up one more time 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:56.720
 Do not avoid weight training and aerobic exercise if the body fat rate is over 19% 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.729
 Then it is said that rebound is waiting after several months when body fat rate is dropped only by diet management 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.960
 about 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:06.449
 It's such a pretty simple story 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.930
 It's a really established way of breaking up your abs. 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.930
 It's just a story of keeping or not following this approach 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:21.110
 Today we have delivered a way to efficiently create six split abs 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.110
 that's all
