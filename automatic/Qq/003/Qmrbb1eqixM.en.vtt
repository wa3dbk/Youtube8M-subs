00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 I show you the solution to the puzzle 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.080
 wooden amazons take off the ring in 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.280
 iron up here 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.150
 Take the cord is in a row 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 in the last of the fifth ring in this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 so it takes and then this cord 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 will have to jump from fifth to fourth to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 third second the first to exit the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 rods with the ball on top 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.380
 in this way we let the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 cord behind the ball is the last 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.110
 ring threading cord from under it 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.050
 let's take the lanyard 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.809
 in front of the ball inserting it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.059
 inside here behind the second than at 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.500
 first 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 take the cord 3 we pass the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.460
 ball we pull a string under the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 first ring we take it from below 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.829
 let the ball be pierced is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.960
 the ring in this way we pull to which 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.390
 the lanyard let us enter the lanyard in the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.070
 third ring and in the second from below 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.290
 below in the second we pass the first 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.020
 we slip cord from under back 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.900
 first ring go past the ball 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.590
 we pull a cord arrives to the second 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.250
 in the take from below we insert 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 cord in the ring in front of the ball 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 let's make other pass behind we pull 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.170
 let's tune it under the helm 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 pass we pull the cord 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.110
 arriving at the 4th ring we take the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 lanyard co slip inside in the fourth 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.750
 ring that in the third ring in this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.840
 way to make clear we do 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.090
 pass the first two rings 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.570
 we slip the cord from behind the first one 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.130
 ring we also pass the ball 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.250
 we spin cord in the same way in the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.049
 second link to first in this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.179
 so let's get the cord back 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.299
 the little ball 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.569
 we press it it came back under the snow that it reverts 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.609
 in front, let's get a string enters the 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.930
 third 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.810
 let's take the cord 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.230
 in the second passing the first a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 enter from below here behind the first 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.790
 ring if you want to cross the ball 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.519
 we pull the Koran under making it pass 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.230
 in the first year ahead passing the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.290
 ball behind 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.870
 let 's take the string below 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.560
 pass the ball and the rings in 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.230
 this way we have already solved the first one 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.780
 ring now when I pull the cord 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.810
 from the fifth ring will jump into the third in 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.950
 this way pulling it here will know 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.650
 this is the most difficult operation 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.799
 now it always becomes repetitive that more 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.219
 easy you stick agreements is not fourth 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.780
 ring bypasses all the rings 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.109
 making it pass from behind the ball 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.239
 entering the first ring behind you pull 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.359
 the cord in front of the ball yes 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.120
 slips into the second and the first yes 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:21.590
 passes the ball and pulls a souvenir 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.979
 under the first in the two are crossed 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:30.169
 rings follow agreements under the third 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:33.079
 putting on the third and the second yes 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.030
 goes over to the first one slips on lanyard from 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.970
 under the first ring behind the ball 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.549
 then making it pass in front and 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.239
 pulling it in the second now take it 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.439
 the cord slips into the last ring 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.739
 in front of the ball you pass 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:51.049
 behind you take the cord from behind you 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.319
 pull in front and in this way we have 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.229
 already jumped from the fourth and fifth with the 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.509
 shot from the lanyard that's it this way 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.079
 we already have the third now becomes more 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.829
 easy 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.049
 put the column back on 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.329
 ball the ring you enter the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.540
 draw cord behind the ball 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:15.259
 in front of this way you pass the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.079
 cord in the second and first ring 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.930
 in front of the ball you pass behind 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.750
 at 2000 quarry 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.460
 you take the bodice from behind you pull 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.639
 forward and with this operation 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.509
 we already jump from the third ring in the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.550
 second now it becomes easier and easier 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.009
 if in the row always lanyard in the second 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.669
 ring goes over with the ball 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.180
 slips the ring from behind with the 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.610
 ball is pulled in front of you and this way 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 we already jump into the last ring with 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.800
 astra this is an operation 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.930
 very simple senses the front tuning 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.930
 the ball is passed behind 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.530
 ball and we have solved the puzzle a 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.530
