make it work because the lower the
manipulation<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.910> better<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.019> for<00:02:42.080> me

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
manipulation the the better it is for me

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.559

get<00:02:46.700> tangled<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.269> easily<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.830> that's<00:02:49.100> really

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
get tangled as easily so that's really

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.210 
get tangled as easily so that's really
really<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.840> think<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> most<00:02:51.650> important
