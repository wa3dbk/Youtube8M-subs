00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
the motherboard actually letting me for

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.509 
the motherboard actually letting me for
these<00:03:02.350> things<00:03:02.560> back<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
these things back for now this is the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.630 
these things back for now this is the
motherboard<00:03:08.489> let<00:03:09.489> me<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.940> take<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.480> out<00:03:10.750> and

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
it can even support o´clock memory up to

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.590 
it can even support o´clock memory up to
two<00:03:21.160> thousand<00:03:21.519> six<00:03:21.700> hundred<00:03:21.850> megahertz<00:03:22.359> if

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
two thousand six hundred megahertz if

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.949 
two thousand six hundred megahertz if
I'm<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.840> wrong<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.970> love<00:03:25.180> heat<00:03:25.540> sinks

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
squid bass feature using which you can

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.170 
squid bass feature using which you can
quickly<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.500> load<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> bass<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.850> USB

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
quickly just load the bass on the USB

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.960 
quickly just load the bass on the USB
stick<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:31.230> believe<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.770> even<00:04:32.100> if<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.490> CPU<00:04:32.700> is

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
stick I believe and even if the CPU is

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.910 
stick I believe and even if the CPU is
also<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:33.390> there<00:04:33.630> just<00:04:34.350> restore<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.920> bias<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
also not there just restore the bias and

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.040 
also not there just restore the bias and
moving<00:04:37.920> over<00:04:38.160> here<00:04:38.370> we<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:39.060> plenty<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.540> PCI

and actually we have one two three and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.650 
and actually we have one two three and
four<00:04:58.200> PCI<00:04:58.650> 1x<00:04:59.100> slots<00:04:59.430> so<00:05:00.240> plenty<00:05:00.570> of

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
four PCI 1x slots so plenty of

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.600 
four PCI 1x slots so plenty of
expandability<00:05:01.260> with<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:01.920> motherboard<00:05:02.220> and

expandability with this motherboard and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.510 
expandability with this motherboard and
as<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.480> see<00:05:03.540> we<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:04.080> nice<00:05:04.830> heat<00:05:05.250> size

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
as you can see we have nice heat size

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.790 
as you can see we have nice heat size
over<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.000> actual<00:05:06.120> chipsets<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.620> that's

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
over the actual chipsets so that's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.520 
over the actual chipsets so that's
pretty<00:05:08.010> nice<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.270> you're<00:05:09.390> going<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.200> do<00:05:10.290> or

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
pretty nice so if you're going to do or

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.090 
pretty nice so if you're going to do or
clocking<00:05:10.919> etc<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:12.150> motherboard<00:05:12.480> should

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
clocking etc this motherboard should

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.590 
clocking etc this motherboard should
stay<00:05:14.100> relatively<00:05:14.520> cool<00:05:14.970> because<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.450> the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
stay relatively cool because of the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.870 
stay relatively cool because of the
efficient<00:05:16.080> heat<00:05:16.260> sinks<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.830> as<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
efficient heat sinks and as this is a

so<00:05:46.169> if<00:05:46.290> anything<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:46.950> wrong<00:05:47.130> with<00:05:47.340> the

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
so if anything is wrong with the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.350 
so if anything is wrong with the
motherboard<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:48.330> get<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:49.040> display<00:05:50.040> like<00:05:50.310> 0<00:05:50.700> to

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
motherboard you get a display like 0 to

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.210 
motherboard you get a display like 0 to
0-3<00:05:51.720> some<00:05:52.050> code<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:52.620> can<00:05:52.770> look<00:05:52.890> up<00:05:53.010> in<00:05:53.100> the

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
to talk about is as you notice there is

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.700 
to talk about is as you notice there is
ample<00:06:21.610> amount<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.060> space<00:06:22.300> between<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:23.020> RAM

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
ample amount of space between the RAM

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.430 
ample amount of space between the RAM
sticks<00:06:24.070> and<00:06:24.310> the<00:06:24.730> actual<00:06:25.210> CPU<00:06:25.870> socket<00:06:26.290> and

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
sticks and the actual CPU socket and

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.230 
sticks and the actual CPU socket and
this<00:06:27.070> will<00:06:27.190> be<00:06:27.340> helpful<00:06:27.520> if<00:06:27.850> you're<00:06:27.970> going<00:06:28.120> to

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
this will be helpful if you're going to

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.750 
this will be helpful if you're going to
install<00:06:28.740> aftermarket<00:06:29.740> air<00:06:29.950> coolers<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:30.580> I

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
install aftermarket air coolers and I

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.550 
install aftermarket air coolers and I
highly<00:06:31.000> recommend<00:06:31.090> that<00:06:31.510> if<00:06:31.960> you're<00:06:32.320> going<00:06:32.380> to

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
highly recommend that if you're going to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.430 
highly recommend that if you're going to
use<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.950> chip<00:06:33.220> like<00:06:33.250> i7<00:06:34.060> or<00:06:34.210> even<00:06:34.810> IFI<00:06:35.140> and<00:06:35.350> if

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
use a chip like i7 or even IFI and if

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.380 
use a chip like i7 or even IFI and if
you<00:06:35.530> go<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.680> duo<00:06:35.860> clocking<00:06:36.400> generally<00:06:37.150> in<00:06:37.240> some

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
you go to duo clocking generally in some

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.240 
you go to duo clocking generally in some
other<00:06:37.570> birds<00:06:37.810> I<00:06:37.960> find<00:06:38.230> that<00:06:38.410> these<00:06:38.860> memories

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
other birds I find that these memories

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.580 
other birds I find that these memories
thoughts<00:06:39.430> are<00:06:39.700> very<00:06:40.030> close<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:40.960> the<00:06:41.080> CPU<00:06:41.440> and

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
thoughts are very close to the CPU and

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.500 
thoughts are very close to the CPU and
if<00:06:41.830> you<00:06:41.950> install<00:06:42.340> aftermarket<00:06:43.180> coolers

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
if you install aftermarket coolers

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.900 
if you install aftermarket coolers
generally<00:06:44.320> you<00:06:44.410> cannot<00:06:44.650> put<00:06:44.890> Ram<00:06:45.220> on<00:06:45.460> the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
generally you cannot put Ram on the

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.420 
generally you cannot put Ram on the
first<00:06:46.270> slot<00:06:46.540> but<00:06:47.290> it<00:06:47.440> looks<00:06:47.650> like<00:06:47.890> we<00:06:48.250> have

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
first slot but it looks like we have

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.360 
first slot but it looks like we have
