you<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.819> tell<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.299> not<00:02:27.920> factory

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you can tell that this is not factory

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.089 
you can tell that this is not factory
because<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:30.170> believe<00:02:31.170> underneath<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> bottom

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
because I believe underneath the bottom

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.800 
because I believe underneath the bottom
you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.250> still<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.849> it's<00:02:33.000> blue<00:02:33.510> under<00:02:34.440> there

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
I think it's black underneath but I

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.710 
I think it's black underneath but I
