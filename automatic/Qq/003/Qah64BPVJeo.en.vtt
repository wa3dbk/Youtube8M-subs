00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:32.210
 Problem of adding natural numbers 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.270
 Julissa was born on June 25, 2001 in 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.399
 what date and year will it be 12 years for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.120
 solve this problem we will use 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.170
 the method of georges pool already step 1 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 understands the problem and we identify the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.980
 unknown 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.980
 on what date and year will celebrate 12 years 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.370
 We identified the data June 25 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.370
 of 2001 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.200
 we identify the condition 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.909
 that is as a verb was born 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.660
 within the unknown also 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.660
 we found the condition will fulfill 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 step 2 conceive a plan 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.710
 in the plan we consider the operation 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.690
 Mathematics related to the condition 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.690
 and the unknown 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.960
 add the year you were born with the years 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.960
 that will fulfill 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.380
 execute the plan 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.840
 add the year in which he was born 2001 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:58.620
 plus the years that will be 12 years old 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.540
 adding 2 thousand 112 we get 2013 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.010
 4 examine the solution obtained we make 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.770
 a review of the three steps 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.050
 above and we answer the question 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:18.850
 on what date and year will celebrate 12 years 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.850
 on June 25 , 2013 will be 12 years old

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.870
 problem of subtraction of numbers 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.349
 natural 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.129
 If I need 135 soles for 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.230
 buy a television that costs 900 56 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.950
 new soles how much do I have 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.200
 Step 1 understands the problem 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.709
 we identify the mystery how much is it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 that I have 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.959
 we identify the new data 135 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.959
 Suns 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.629
 956 nuevos soles 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.290
 a television 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.379
 we identify the condition that is 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.379
 I am missing a verb 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.880
 to buy 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.690
 what does it cost 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.920
 Within the unknown, we find the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.920
 condition I have 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.260
 Step 2 Get a plan 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.170
 that is, the mathematical operation 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.210
 related to the condition and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.670
 unknown 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.980
 and subtract what the TV costs with 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.400
 what I need to buy and the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.400
 result is what I have 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.069
 execute the plan 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.860
 subtract what the TV costs is 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.860
 say 956 new soles 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.080
 What I need to buy is 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.450
 say 135 new soles 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:20.519
 we obtain as a result 821 new 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.519
 Soles, that's what I have 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.820
 4 we examine the solution obtained is 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.220
 say we do a review of the three 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.249
 previous steps and we respond to the 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:39.579
 incognito how much is what I have 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.579
 I have 821 nuevos soles
