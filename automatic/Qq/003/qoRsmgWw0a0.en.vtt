packaging on this by the way but Castle

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:49.309 
packaging on this by the way but Castle
here<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:44.130> there<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> castle<00:02:48.319> 3800

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
here and there it is this a castle 3800

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.740 
here and there it is this a castle 3800
kV<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:51.420> brushless<00:02:51.690> motor<00:02:52.260> 4<00:02:52.620> pole<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.130> course

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750

kV the brushless motor 4 pole of course
for<00:02:54.750> more<00:02:54.930> torque<00:02:56.330> let's<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.510> compare<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for more torque let's just compare the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.580 
for more torque let's just compare the
size<00:02:58.799> wise<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.230> Millennium<00:03:01.230> because<00:03:01.500> I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
size wise to the Millennium because I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.050 
size wise to the Millennium because I
got<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:02.010> hand<00:03:02.280> right<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.970> can

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
got that on hand right now as you can

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
got that on hand right now as you can
see<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.390> quite<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.720> bit<00:03:03.840> shorter<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.500> it's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
see it's quite a bit shorter but it's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.030 
see it's quite a bit shorter but it's
got<00:03:04.769> way<00:03:05.430> more<00:03:05.630> kick<00:03:06.630> than<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.930> would<00:03:07.110> expect

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
got way more kick than you would expect

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.740 
got way more kick than you would expect
from<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.299> guy<00:03:11.060> weight<00:03:12.060> wise<00:03:12.299> about

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
from this little guy weight wise about

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.449 
from this little guy weight wise about
the<00:03:12.989> same<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:15.209> yeah<00:03:15.360> that's<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.459> unboxing

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
the same so yeah that's that unboxing

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.340 
the same so yeah that's that unboxing
let<00:03:17.730> me<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:19.100> get<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.340> installed<00:03:21.350> I'll

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
let me just get this installed I'll

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.509 
let me just get this installed I'll
probably<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:22.769> time<00:03:23.040> lapse<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
probably go time lapse of the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.170 
probably go time lapse of the
installation<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.180> I'll<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.570> back<00:03:25.579> alright<00:03:26.579> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
installation so I'll be back alright so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
installation so I'll be back alright so
I<00:03:27.209> got<00:03:27.720> her<00:03:27.900> installed<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:31.739> was<00:03:31.859> very<00:03:32.100> simple

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
I got her installed it was very simple

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.920 
I got her installed it was very simple
and<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:32.640> attach<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> motor<00:03:33.329> known<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
and just attach the motor known to the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.470 
and just attach the motor known to the
motor<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.560> zip<00:03:35.400> tied<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.760> fan<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.180> there<00:03:36.390> and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
motor a zip tied the fan on there and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.940 
motor a zip tied the fan on there and
after<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> got<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.019> was<00:03:37.170> secured<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.739> night

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
after I got that I was secured the night

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400 
after I got that I was secured the night
put<00:03:38.820> some<00:03:38.970> double-sided<00:03:39.329> tape<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.930> SC<00:03:40.380> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
put some double-sided tape on the SC I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.900 
put some double-sided tape on the SC I
don't<00:03:40.709> know<00:03:40.829> how<00:03:40.950> that's<00:03:41.130> gonna<00:03:41.250> hold<00:03:41.549> and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
don't know how that's gonna hold and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.569 
don't know how that's gonna hold and
seem<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.209> be<00:03:42.420> pretty<00:03:42.750> strong<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:44.250> once<00:03:44.459> it

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
seem to be pretty strong and once it

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.000 
seem to be pretty strong and once it
heat<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.090> was<00:03:45.209> stick<00:03:45.600> better<00:03:45.780> um<00:03:46.200> but

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
heat up and it was stick better um but

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.680 
heat up and it was stick better um but
the<00:03:47.130> cables<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.640> back<00:03:47.850> for<00:03:48.209> bike<00:03:48.390> ride

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the cables in the back for bike ride

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
right so I finished using some zip ties

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.150 
right so I finished using some zip ties
on<00:04:18.049> all<00:04:18.170> these<00:04:18.290> wires<00:04:18.530> cleaned<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:18.980> up<00:04:19.070> a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
on all these wires cleaned it up a

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.310 
on all these wires cleaned it up a
little<00:04:19.250> bit

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
little bit

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.170

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
unfortunately I can't use the fan for

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.490 
unfortunately I can't use the fan for
the<00:04:23.240> motor<00:04:23.450> yet<00:04:23.690> because<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.080> got<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.380> get<00:04:24.470> a

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the motor yet because I got to get a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.800 
the motor yet because I got to get a
splitter<00:04:25.150> because<00:04:26.150> there's<00:04:26.390> not<00:04:26.510> enough

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
splitter because there's not enough

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.130 
splitter because there's not enough
plugs<00:04:27.140> on<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.380> spectrum<00:04:27.940> receiver<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.750> yeah<00:04:29.900> I

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
plugs on the spectrum receiver so yeah I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.240 
plugs on the spectrum receiver so yeah I
can<00:04:30.650> subscribe<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.880> good<00:04:32.090> day
