00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.430
 about the viral video that is in this 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.710
 now yes that ending by all the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.690
 inter deported youtube is a video that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.020
 have premiered he has more than 57 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.750
 million views 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.580

 in this image to give you useful and 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.780
 go see the video is to give notice 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.700
 but it is entertaining that they go to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.680
 check it out today we're going to talk about 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.480
 the changes of some series in others 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.430
 series or what you mean when you 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 they mix the series that I think is one of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.570
 the most epic chapters in any 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.310
 of the series can be ethical or 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.190
 disastrous and let's start with this 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.840
 list of series or series encounters 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.450
 with other series and there are many examples 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.790
 many but let's dedicate more or less 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.890
 what are the main reasons 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.869
 to me to make a list of the series 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.420
 that I remember the bernie that were the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.190
 chapters for me and first the first 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.570
 of which I have memory is when 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.970
 finds in the series a very work 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.550
 big first when for kids 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.260
 with the series of geranium to read a 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.670
 ramón girl who was created by a doctor 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.380
 and that he had twin brothers who 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.260
 They were like my little angels in which 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.300
 they had living on an island and that island 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.890
 by accident or to look for a star 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.840
 of the aragon in a dragon sphere 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.460
 accident and when you see when it 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.290
 find with nadal I think it is one 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.030
 of the most epic chapters so 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.190
 well this is the first chapter the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.440
 second chapter is the second meeting 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.300
 you are lucky are unfortunate 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.980
 this series we are going to record several 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.480
 chapters because the fact this series 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.380
 he made a series of videos where he 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.390
 they found with different 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.610
 personalities of the medium that for their 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 time they were very famous for example the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.020
 three cranks several comic actors of 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.180
 its time and in this chapter that is the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.310
 as the most representative is when 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.709
 discoverer and mystery to the rescue is 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.780
 meet with batman with 'batman and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.570
 robin ' and they make a special chapter of 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.070
 50 and solve a mystery this is a 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.900
 special chapter also have other 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.090
 special chapters like for example 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.640
 when they meet with johnny for hbo 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.500
 that is also a chapter so 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
 would be a bit more current because I would 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 he said it is much older then 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 is to teach the second encounters 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.769
 of the escobedo series or ministry to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.670
 rescue with other series we go to the third 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.590
 meeting 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 the third encounter that I feel is 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.030
 a little epic and also how to commit 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.040
 memories because it was like the series 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.959
 most important when I was a child was the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.209
 of power rangers but the first nothing 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.849
 more the first was when they were 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.500
 them with the ninja turtles a 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.780
 encounter of the ninja turtles with 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.209
 power rangers was like it's been 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 structured a doctor in a plan to 653 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.380
 in a chapter with the king payments is something 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.300
 super epic and there's also going to be a 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.430
 special chapter of payments any 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.410
 where are all the payments 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.450
 goodbye as well as that all the different 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.940
 payments rangers in the first generation 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.560
 of a third and I do not know how many and do 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.840
 so a super special chapter for 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.459
 defeat a bad guy and then back 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.959
 the next encounter of beings within 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.030
 of other series is the meeting of cv 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.220
 with the transport to ran true 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.690
 von teese and your friend are all in a 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.310
 series of chapters in which there is a 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.170
 competition to eat and find a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.209
 super delicious meat that is like a 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.040
 tournament well then it 's very good that 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.200
 we have look in the internet to see if 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.819
 you can see it and that is one of the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.989
 more epic or unfortunate encounters 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.970
 within this list of the following 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.650
 encounter is in the next meeting 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 special chapter of ends

 marvel operation in this chapter good 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.400
 fine figure helps the superheroes the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.610
 avengers to regain their power what 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.040
 it would be iron man thor hulk and spider-man 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.080
 there they do with a team it and for the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.599
 other side the doctor useful if you already do 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.360
 a team with the shield kings with 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.640
 sorry green with the big head I am that

 always saves the bizarre funny and 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.049
 ethical but good but then that the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.670
 internet to see if you can find me and 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.650
