00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.360
 logitech is very happy with its fame 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.250
 popular in the bluetooth boxing business 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.330
 got in and now they have a new one 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.550
 Product at the start 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.260
 Let's take a look at them today 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.910
 ruhr comes in a pretty funny way 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.340
 Packing to you the speaker 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.950
 itself and a nice usb cable contains 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.840
 an aux cable or a water repellent 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.850
 You are looking for a vain here because of the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.410
 loudspeaker yes even waterproof 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.329
 is that is one of the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.700
 main arguments for the roll even 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.440
 has a small swim ring on it 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.630
 which can swim rowing and thus 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.490
 music in the water can play itself 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.350
 Everything feels very robust and 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.240
 high quality and I like the colorful 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.400
 design with the fabric is the service 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.320
 also very simple and thanks 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.329
 the loop on the speaker itself can 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.220
 you can hang them up or take them everywhere 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.590
 you can even take a shower with it or something 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.360
 because she is waterproof now 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.040
 the question is whether such features 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.750
 maybe not in such a small box 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.860
 let the sound and the answer 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.439
 Thank God 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.329
 no the box sounds very clear and 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.579
 overdriven if ever at extreme 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.710
 volume is a bit for that 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.590
 bass not really available 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
 a bit but not really me 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 but that was not so annoying because 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 the design in itself for it 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.240
 makes sure that the music goes up out of the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.459
 loudspeaker comes out and thus all 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.229
 what about if you have friends, for example 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.749
 sitting or sitting in a circle on a lake 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.149
 So my overall impression was to roll so 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.979
 very positive because they are extraordinary 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.289
 transportable robust and sonorous 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.450
 more balanced than other boxes in this one 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.979
 bigger price range is i have that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.139
 Part really gladly took and was 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.789
 actually never disappointed if you 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:45.529
 but think this is perhaps not the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.880
 right for me then looks at a 

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.740
 Channel over because I have four 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.869
 more reviews on four others 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.700
 bluetooth boxes and a comparison to 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 rolink in the video description 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.049
 as well as the purchase link to the juridiction 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.310
 My name is Kilian. See you soon 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.310
 again, it'll be good until then
