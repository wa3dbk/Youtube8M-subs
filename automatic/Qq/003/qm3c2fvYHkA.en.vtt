then lift up okay one of the common
problem<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:21.060> start<00:02:21.570> very<00:02:22.050> light<00:02:22.890> and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
problem is that we start very light and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.510 
problem is that we start very light and
press<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> press<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:27.620> then<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.220> brush

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
press and press so much then the brush

press and press so much then the brush
cannot<00:02:30.090> even<00:02:30.510> bounce<00:02:31.320> back<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.940> have

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
cannot even bounce back so you have

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.760 
cannot even bounce back so you have
these<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:35.220> kind<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.760> ending<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:37.230> bulky

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
these this kind of ending a very bulky

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.600 
these this kind of ending a very bulky
and<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.910> slender<00:02:39.830> backing<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and not slender backing that is a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.880 
and not slender backing that is a
problem<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.870> press<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.230> too<00:02:43.650> much

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
problem because you press it too much

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.750 
problem because you press it too much
and<00:02:44.480> then<00:02:45.480> there's<00:02:45.720> no<00:02:46.050> way<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> brush<00:02:47.520> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and then there's no way for the brush to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.560 
and then there's no way for the brush to
come<00:02:48.000> back<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:50.180> strength<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.870> your<00:02:52.770> brush<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
come back the strength is your brush is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.530 
come back the strength is your brush is
exhausted<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.290> too<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.250> pressure<00:02:56.880> put<00:02:57.360> on

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
exhausted it is too much pressure put on

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.199 
exhausted it is too much pressure put on
it<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.500> no<00:02:58.800> way<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.640> brush<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
it there is no way for the brush to

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.410 
it there is no way for the brush to
bounce<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.250> when<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.489> feel<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.180> leaf

make sure that your brush tip can bounce

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.990
