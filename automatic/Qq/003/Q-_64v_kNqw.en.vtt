00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.649
 good youtube friends in this video 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.930
 I will show you how you can as 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.589
 you can pass the photos of your computer 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.630
 or from your computer to the iphone reel 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.720
 well directly without having to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.610
 to save your photos in streaming with 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.670
 the icloud on the computer is nothing 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.800
 that the only requirements are going to be 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.990
 have the iphone box 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.599
 the inbox the link I'll leave it in the 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.890
 description or if you can not look it up in 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.440
 google as if a little here is can 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.160
 see the name then what we have 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.520
 what to do first is to enter the box 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.460
 function serve this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 we entered classic football and then 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.160
 in that moment we connect our 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 device 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.180
 it can be before 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.130
 what matters is that here the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 iphone ready 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.820
 stressed that this method is useful for 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.530
 what is the break for users 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 jailbreak and those who do not have jailbreak 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 then we will do if they have 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.200
 English this is in English I do not know how it will be 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.030
 in Spanish but we are a road says 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.939
 file system in Spanish I do not know how it would be 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.240
 but usually it should look like everything 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.640
 it should look like this 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.690
 then here we enter the folder of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 forever 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.130
 100% apple 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 and here are the images that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.590
 we have on the reel we take 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 that if I these two images here they 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 I want to move to the line 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.770
 can you make the images that you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.560
 want as I am here 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.310
 let us just go in the 600 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.370
 good images 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.570
 we select the images 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.570
 and in the iphone box 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.159
 in the box 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.220
 we copy them 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.650
 we copy them I'm not going to copy them 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.960
 because they do not have a correct name like that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.420
 that is going to make a mess if it is that you 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.440
 they have their previous images saved 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.970
 as well as in img 005 so it's not going to have 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.380
 no problem but if they have some 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.210
 names in the images as home 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.680
 that is, auto 1 birthday so have a 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.260
 little of problems but they will appear in 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.730
 the important reel is a bird state 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.520
 here copy the images that you 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.990
 want and then again we come back here 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.210
 a raw file system 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.570
 we enter photo data 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.700
 and here we look for this file that only 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.980
 say for photos 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 light this here we take and erase what 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.930
 we erase I do not erase it because I already have 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.900
 all done 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.180
 they delete this at this time when 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.230
 you already delete this disconnect your 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.310
 device 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.310
 disconnects it 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:23.170
 restart your device once he 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.710
 or that the iphone is being restored 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.420
 iphone ipod and ipad apply for these 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.480
 Models 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.659
 once it restarts 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.269
 Maybe if they keep them 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.500
 restarting do not scare the phone 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.750
 come back to me it happened to me the same 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.909
 the phone died he started at two 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 times but to the third ripped 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.370
 correctly and already and I just went into 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.610
 reel and they began to load the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.140
 photos all photos 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.130
 well I think that has been everything and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.910
 thanks for watching this video is very simple 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.910
 see you later
