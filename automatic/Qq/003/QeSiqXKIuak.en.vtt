more<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.830> then<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.400> will<00:02:00.520> pull<00:02:00.670> off<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:02.380> set

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
more and then it will pull off just set

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.890 
more and then it will pull off just set
that<00:02:02.740> aside<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:07.270> pry<00:02:07.540> out<00:02:07.690> your

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
that aside for now and then pry out your

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:19.380 
that aside for now and then pry out your
brake<00:02:08.080> pads<00:02:16.740> next<00:02:17.740> remove<00:02:18.340> these<00:02:18.520> two<00:02:18.820> 21

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
brake pads next remove these two 21

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.630 
brake pads next remove these two 21
millimeter<00:02:19.930> bolts<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:24.130> use<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> piece<00:02:24.580> of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
millimeter bolts and we use a piece of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.710 
millimeter bolts and we use a piece of
pipe<00:02:24.970> for<00:02:25.240> some<00:02:25.420> extra<00:02:25.780> leverage<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.510> once

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
pipe for some extra leverage and once

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.180 
pipe for some extra leverage and once
you<00:02:28.810> break<00:02:28.959> them<00:02:29.140> free<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:29.920> remove

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
you break them free you can just remove

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.770 
you break them free you can just remove
them<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> rest<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.790> way<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.150> we'll<00:02:31.540> fast

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
them the rest of the way and we'll fast

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
them the rest of the way and we'll fast
forward<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:32.230> dawn<00:02:32.410> does<00:02:32.620> this

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.520 

and<00:02:43.270> if<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:44.420> rotor<00:02:44.600> doesn't<00:02:44.990> pull<00:02:45.170> right<00:02:45.350> off

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and if your rotor doesn't pull right off

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.790 
and if your rotor doesn't pull right off
just<00:02:45.800> replace<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> lug<00:02:46.670> nut<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:48.380> hammer

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
just replace a lug nut and then hammer

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.440 
just replace a lug nut and then hammer
from<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.250> back<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.670> rotor

once<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.600> breaks<00:02:56.840> free<00:02:57.110> remove<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.830> lug<00:02:57.980> nut

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
once it breaks free remove the lug nut

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.530 
once it breaks free remove the lug nut
and<00:02:58.310> pull<00:02:58.550> your<00:02:58.700> rotor<00:02:58.910> off<00:03:02.620> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:05.150> left<00:03:05.360> is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
and pull your rotor off on the left is

can see that are identical and they're

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.200 
can see that are identical and they're
going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> fit<00:03:11.780> exactly<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.320> same<00:03:13.150> using<00:03:14.150> a
