that's just pretty interesting even for
me<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.060> accept<00:03:18.360> my<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.720> person<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
me and I accept my not person but I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.009 
me and I accept my not person but I
never<00:03:20.700> knew<00:03:20.940> there's<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.299> many<00:03:21.420> damn<00:03:21.720> types

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
never knew there's so many damn types

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.839 
never knew there's so many damn types
that<00:03:22.200> types<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.709> not<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:23.099> check<00:03:23.310> out<00:03:23.489> this

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
that types and not just check out this

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:34.280 
that types and not just check out this
one<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:25.579> got<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:26.760> slow<00:03:27.090> right<00:03:27.299> now

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.470 

so<00:03:34.890> again<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.250> rotate<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.879> wash<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.200> looks

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
so again you rotate it wash it I looks

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.220 
so again you rotate it wash it I looks
that<00:03:39.480> way

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that way

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.290 
that way
stop<00:03:40.500> stop<00:03:40.860> it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.390 

and<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:50.020> slow<00:03:50.170> down<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.530> maximum<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:51.190> that

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and just slow down the maximum is that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.600 
and just slow down the maximum is that
slow<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.360> lower<00:03:52.540> hand<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:54.070> really

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
slow but this is lower hand so really

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.290 
slow but this is lower hand so really
gives<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> nice<00:03:55.350> idea<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.530> how<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.850> make<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
gives you a nice idea of how to make the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.030 
gives you a nice idea of how to make the
knots<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.810> think<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.500> cool<00:03:59.800> app

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
knots I think this is a really cool app

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.750 
knots I think this is a really cool app
to<00:04:00.400> check<00:04:00.640> out<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:01.240> was<00:04:02.110> free<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.890> wasn't<00:04:03.640> sure
