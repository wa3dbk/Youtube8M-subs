00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you know you're not going to be at a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
you know you're not going to be at a
very<00:01:05.220> funny<00:01:05.580> angle<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> stuff<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
very funny angle and stuff like that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500 
very funny angle and stuff like that
it's<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.400> difficult<00:01:09.240> than

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's it's it's a lot more difficult than

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's it's it's a lot more difficult than
it<00:01:09.840> looks<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.500> guess<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.250> ways<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it looks I guess in some ways it is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
it looks I guess in some ways it is
quite<00:01:12.360> difficult<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.890> know

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
quite difficult like you see you know

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.120 
quite difficult like you see you know
I'm<00:01:14.869> definitely<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.619> frustrated

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I'm definitely a little bit frustrated

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.480 
I'm definitely a little bit frustrated
with<00:01:17.280> trying<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> picture<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.490> at

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with trying to take a picture of this at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.539 
with trying to take a picture of this at
a<00:01:20.549> most<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.479> without<00:01:21.689> looking<00:01:21.930> funny<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a most you know without looking funny so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
a most you know without looking funny so
finally<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.939> took<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> picture<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> takes<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
finally I took a picture but it takes a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
finally I took a picture but it takes a
long<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> problem<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
long time you know the problem with this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
long time you know the problem with this
is<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.689> fact<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> front<00:01:28.680> board

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
is the fact that it is a front board

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
is the fact that it is a front board
forward<00:01:29.670> facing<00:01:29.820> camera<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.720> fact<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
forward facing camera and the fact that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.170 
forward facing camera and the fact that
it<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.200> located<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> very<00:01:32.220> left<00:01:32.670> hand<00:01:32.939> side

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it is located at the very left hand side

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
it is located at the very left hand side
rather<00:01:33.479> than<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> middle<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.710> not

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
rather than in the middle I mean not

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
rather than in the middle I mean not
that<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> middle<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that you know the middle will make it a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
that you know the middle will make it a
little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.380> definitely<00:01:37.829> having

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
little bit better but definitely having

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.789 
little bit better but definitely having
it<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.930> side<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> camera

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it on the one at one side of the camera

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.760 
it on the one at one side of the camera
it's<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.850> hard<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> focus<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's really hard to focus so that your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's really hard to focus so that your
picture<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.460> look<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.479> look<00:01:45.689> very

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
picture will look out you know look very

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.649 
picture will look out you know look very
nice<00:01:46.140> obviously<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.820> slight<00:01:48.479> problem

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
nice obviously there's a slight problem

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.240 
nice obviously there's a slight problem
with<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> design

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
with you know this kind of design

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
with you know this kind of design
because<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.689> practical<00:01:51.990> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
because it's not very practical it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
because it's not very practical it's
very<00:01:52.770> difficult<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.310> try<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.180> know

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
very difficult to try and you know

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
very difficult to try and you know
position<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> shot<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.680> doesn't

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
position the shot so that it doesn't

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399 
position the shot so that it doesn't
look<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.820> totally<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.930> lopsided

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
look so you know totally like lopsided

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.219 
look so you know totally like lopsided
you<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.399> I've<00:02:00.090> taken<00:02:00.479> lots<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.930> pictures<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you know I've taken lots of pictures and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
you know I've taken lots of pictures and
it's<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.219> difficult<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.909> because

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it's very difficult with this because

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's very difficult with this because
not<00:02:04.170> only<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.890> colors<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.670> nice

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
not only are the colors not very nice

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.719 
not only are the colors not very nice
but<00:02:06.750> also<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.409> fact<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:07.920> your

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
but also the fact that you know your

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.300 
but also the fact that you know your
your<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:10.140> picture<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.160> look

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
a little bit
