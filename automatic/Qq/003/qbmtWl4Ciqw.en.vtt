 Yes er who went to see it a television broadcast in the fact that a little while ago the country knitting the this time 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.470
 I think I'm coming 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:19.539
 Broadcast did not notice I was defeating myself 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:22.650
 I thought it would still be next but 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.420
 Uyung was not 14 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 What I do very much with seemed caught up in this original 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.800
 It it was a the time being 1 Cool 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.660
 Once again rebroadcast

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.260
 Broadcast time because 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 Because the broadcast on the 9th is about 55 at the time of 5 recordings 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.340
 I wonder if it will be changed on the 23rd 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.400
 Though I think that there is a little change from 27:05 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.550
 I'm holding it from midnight 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:22.900
