00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
this scent is a very unisex not feminine

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060

at<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.390> there's<00:00:39.719> no<00:00:39.780> florals<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.950> would

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
at all there's no florals and it would

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
at all there's no florals and it would
actually<00:00:41.250> probably<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.030> better<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> men's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
actually probably do better as a men's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
actually probably do better as a men's
scent<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.010> released<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
scent so if they released this as a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220

men's<00:00:45.000> fragrance<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.570> pretty<00:00:45.809> sure<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> it
