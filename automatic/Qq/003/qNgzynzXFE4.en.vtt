surface reflecting off the sunlight but

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.710 
surface reflecting off the sunlight but
look<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> stairwell

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.630 

it<00:00:24.170> looks<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.470> lot<00:00:24.560> brighter<00:00:24.830> on<00:00:25.070> camera<00:00:25.519> but

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
it looks a lot brighter on camera but

it looks a lot brighter on camera but
this<00:00:25.880> is<00:00:26.060> almost<00:00:26.300> pitch<00:00:26.630> dark<00:00:26.990> that's

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
this is almost pitch dark that's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.620 
this is almost pitch dark that's
unacceptable<00:00:28.329> somebody<00:00:29.329> could<00:00:29.480> get<00:00:29.570> hurt

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
here alrighty there is a lighting issue

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.639 
here alrighty there is a lighting issue
and<00:00:34.640> by<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.850> time<00:00:34.970> you<00:00:35.420> see<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:36.290> might

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
and by the time you see this it might

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.170 
and by the time you see this it might
have<00:00:36.769> been<00:00:37.010> resolved<00:00:37.750> what<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.780> did<00:00:39.079> is<00:00:39.290> I<00:00:39.320> set

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
have been resolved what I did is I set

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.350 
have been resolved what I did is I set
exposure<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.870> camera<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:43.269> pretty<00:00:44.269> much

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
exposure on this camera to pretty much

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.259 
exposure on this camera to pretty much
reflect<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.829> intensity<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.670> how<00:00:46.909> things

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
reflect the intensity of how things

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.370 
reflect the intensity of how things
appear<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.870> me

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
appear to me

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.890 
appear to me
so<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> other<00:00:50.280> words

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
so in other words

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.280 
so in other words
it's<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> correct<00:00:53.220> for<00:00:53.310> darkness

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
it's not going to correct for darkness

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.960 
it's not going to correct for darkness
and<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.800> lights<00:00:55.980> haven't<00:00:56.370> kicked<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.700> in<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
and the lights haven't kicked on in the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.200 
and the lights haven't kicked on in the
garage<00:00:57.090> yet<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:58.550> now<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.610> get<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.060> how

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
garage yet and now you get to see how

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.180 
garage yet and now you get to see how
dark<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> stairwell<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:03.440> it's<00:01:04.440> pretty<00:01:04.980> much

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
dark the stairwell is it's pretty much

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.470 
dark the stairwell is it's pretty much
how<00:01:05.370> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:06.380> it's<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.980> much<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.520> about

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
how it is it's pretty much just about

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.150 
how it is it's pretty much just about
pitch<00:01:09.780> dark<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:12.360> cameras<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.620> darker

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
pitch dark now cameras little darker

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.920 
pitch dark now cameras little darker
than<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:19.350> yeah<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.300> serious<00:01:21.750> issue

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
although I didn't want to go that I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
although I didn't want to go that I
