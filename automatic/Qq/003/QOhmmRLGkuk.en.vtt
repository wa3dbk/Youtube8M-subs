another gpus tip of the week and today

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.169 
another gpus tip of the week and today
is<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.069> kind<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.429> fun<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:09.090> going

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
is going to be kind of fun we're going

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.330 
is going to be kind of fun we're going
to<00:00:09.240> be<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.450> over<00:00:09.690> double<00:00:10.200> stops<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.860> guitar

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to be going over double stops on guitar

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.360 
to be going over double stops on guitar
and<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:12.480> exactly<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.110> double<00:00:13.530> stop<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
and what exactly is a double stop it is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.189 
and what exactly is a double stop it is
a<00:00:14.400> very<00:00:14.730> simple<00:00:15.089> definition<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:15.990> two

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
a very simple definition it's just two

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.220 
a very simple definition it's just two
notes<00:00:16.379> played<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.070> once<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:18.230> traditionally

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
notes played at once and traditionally

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
notes played at once and traditionally
in<00:00:19.380> music<00:00:19.710> theory<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.760> would<00:00:20.880> call

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
in music theory we just we would call

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
in music theory we just we would call
that<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.600> interval<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.880> interval<00:00:23.880> just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
that an interval but interval just

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.609 
that an interval but interval just
meaning<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> distance<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.019> defining<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
meaning the distance are defining the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
meaning the distance are defining the
distance<00:00:25.949> between<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.400> notes<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.510> are

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
distance between two notes so there are

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.939 
distance between two notes so there are
different<00:00:27.900> types<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> intervals<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> we'll

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
different types of intervals and we'll

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.290 
different types of intervals and we'll
be<00:00:29.039> talking<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.609> soon<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
be talking about that soon and as a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
be talking about that soon and as a
matter<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.539> fact<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.840> did<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> whole<00:00:31.199> interval

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
matter of fact I did a whole interval

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
matter of fact I did a whole interval
lesson<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.189> guitar<00:00:32.640> play<00:00:32.790> diversity<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.450> go

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
