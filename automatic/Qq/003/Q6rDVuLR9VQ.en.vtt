00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
phone cases and this is the 9h so you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.590 
phone cases and this is the 9h so you
see<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.450> bends<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.829> one<00:03:26.010> does<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
see this one just bends this one does it

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.729 
see this one just bends this one does it
right<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.310> flimsy<00:03:29.640> versus<00:03:30.209> tempered<00:03:30.510> glass

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
right and flimsy versus tempered glass

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.110 
right and flimsy versus tempered glass
so<00:03:31.739> let's<00:03:31.920> drop<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.250> off<00:03:32.459> real<00:03:32.670> quick<00:03:32.910> no
