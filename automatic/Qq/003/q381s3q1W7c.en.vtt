 Sino-Japanese coated in paper 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.170
 of the scissors 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:15.020
 with the cutter, we cut about 30 centimeters of the wire and position it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 only emo mold of tetanus sake 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.299
 xbox we tighten the two ends well by twisting together helping each other 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.939
 with tweezers 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.939
 aci 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.280
 you proceed in the same way 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.509
 making at least 12 petals 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.060
 let's toast to the snow-white flor jar and immerse the shape in 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.560
 metal until closing later we give a sun shape by doing well 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.729
 be careful not to touch the edges of the basement while it is being pulled out because 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.289
 otherwise the resin will not fix but will burst like a soap bubble and 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.240
 it will be necessary to repeat the operation, let the excess resin flow into the 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.489
 container for a few moments hey boy we put the petal to dry 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.239
 inserting the shank into the sponge plane proceed in the same way from all the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.609
 petals prepared if the jar remains too long open and the resin 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.599
 if it is too thick it is possible to add a few drops of thinner 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 to make it fluid again it is suitable for use 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.880
 for about 15 minutes, let's dive into the terrace reinforcing deck if 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.049
 let's go down again for about two hours 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.189
 aci 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.810
 this step is not mandatory but will make the 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.239
 flower made giving the precarious workers a greater consistency 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.930

 picnik cutter 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.180
 we insert one end in the bunch composed of the pistils doing 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.209
 fall out of 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.929
 we trust everything to make the hostel of the desired length with 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.249
 the usual rubber tape 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:44.429
