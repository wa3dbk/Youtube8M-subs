00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.430
 for making origami santa claus 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.279
 take a square colored paper size 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.490
 20 to 20 centimeters fold it by 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490
 diagonals 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.480
 unfold and fold in half 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 expand the leaf and now this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.830
 corner to this line to the middle 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.830
 bend the side 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 corner central 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.390
 such a big triangle 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 laid down 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.400
 and here again this side of this line 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.400
 bending small triangle 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.620
 now through this point we need 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.780
 hold the warehouse we fold so that 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.120
 the line went straight through the intersection 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.120
 our auxiliary lines 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 here it is the line passed through the intersection 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.880
 bend down the top strip down the side 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.450
 we also collect it here 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 corner 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.080
 high tail bend it up 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 turn over the other side again 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:15.069
 we outline the fold and pocket opening 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.989
 it turns out a square we bend a corner to 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.580
 center of this little square 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.410
 thats adjusted once and now again 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 here is this side to the center line and by 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.870
 fold lines once again turn away our 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.959
 striped it we will have a lapel on 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.019
 Santa Claus cap turn away 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:45.480
 a little corner on one side here 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:49.530
 paper and on the other hand we fold 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 crafts on the diagonal 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.269
 now we need this white one 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.459
 triangle unscrew my neat 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.959
 turn out that is, they are like this 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.930
 up all three sides here we should 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.739
 stay but santa claus now he is very 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.250
 big we will make it of course smaller 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:20.450
 So he turned the spout and pull on 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:27.319
 the maximum this angle is up now 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.750
 for a corner and doing folds turned out 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.409
 red long triangle we fold 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.430
 its up perish up 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.430
 almost touches the cap 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.530
 and now we need to deploy it 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:52.940
 open the paper and along the fold 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:56.810
 turn out and reassemble the craft 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.570
 we turned the bag white turn down 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.750
 triangle small down bag we have 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.720
 should be smaller than santa claus 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.959
 it bent made a fold now 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.620
 down below 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.720
 make a turn on a fur coat on one side 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.390
 did the gate turned upside down 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.900
 on the girl from the other side symmetrically 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.239
 the exact same lapel to santa claus 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.940
 we will be voluminous so we are now 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.390
 let's give it such a round shape 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.580
 using scissors or a pencil 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.250
 a little paper curl one 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.050
 sides here she arched us from 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.050
 other side exactly the same 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.550
 on the santa claus cap we will do 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.680
 small 2 mouth for this 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.180
 unfolding paper and triangle 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.580
 pushing forward with such a lapel 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.030
 It turned out to make a bag of Santa Claus and 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.890
 until the coals for this add up here and so 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.650
 slightly polosochka and hide this 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:05.110
 striped under the corner now we need 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.740
 fix our santa claus to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.310
 on the white line 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.820
 form the paper by pressing the ring 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.640
 I iron so that our figure could 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.100
