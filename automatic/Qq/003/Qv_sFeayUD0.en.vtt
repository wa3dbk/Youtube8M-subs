has a very funky sound to it and is
appropriate<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.420> certain<00:00:12.799> songs<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
appropriate for certain songs that is

unlike<00:00:15.240> any<00:00:15.540> other<00:00:15.839> count<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:16.529> going

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
unlike any other count that we're going

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.550 
unlike any other count that we're going
to<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.240> hole<00:00:18.539> strumming<00:00:19.140> course<00:00:19.410> so

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
to do in this hole strumming course so

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.990 
to do in this hole strumming course so
this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.800> something<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> little<00:00:20.310> bit<00:00:20.550> different

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this is something a little bit different

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.019 
this is something a little bit different
I'm<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.439> demo<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.460> E<00:00:23.760> minor

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
I'm going to demo this on an E minor

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
I'm going to demo this on an E minor
chord<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.869> nice<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> easy<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.830> let

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
chord because it's nice and easy and let

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:39.260 
chord because it's nice and easy and let
me<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.430> demo<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.330> all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.470 

now<00:00:40.270> this<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:41.260> account<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:42.040> three<00:00:42.580> strums

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
now this is to account of three strums

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380 
now this is to account of three strums
per<00:00:43.870> beat<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.310> this<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.760> where<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.030> triplet

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
per beat so this is where the triplet

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.840 
per beat so this is where the triplet
idea<00:00:46.810> comes<00:00:47.110> from<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.680> one<00:00:48.100> triplet<00:00:48.490> is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
idea comes from and one triplet is

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.170 
idea comes from and one triplet is
written<00:00:49.390> like<00:00:49.750> this<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.830> when<00:00:51.790> we<00:00:51.940> have<00:00:52.150> a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
written like this so when we have a

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.060 
written like this so when we have a
triplet<00:00:52.510> we<00:00:52.870> have<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:52.990> little<00:00:53.230> number<00:00:53.470> three

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
triplet we have a little number three

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.570 
triplet we have a little number three
and<00:00:55.080> indicating<00:00:56.080> that<00:00:56.110> we<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.500> three<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.340> the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
and indicating that we have three in the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.580 
and indicating that we have three in the
time<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:58.060> two<00:00:58.330> which<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:58.870> technically<00:00:59.320> what<00:00:59.560> a

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
time of two which is technically what a

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.299 
time of two which is technically what a
triplet<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.020> demo<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:02.950> a<00:01:02.980> slow

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
triplet is so to demo this with a slow

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
triplet is so to demo this with a slow
count<00:01:03.730> we<00:01:04.570> would<00:01:04.780> have<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:07.060> two<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
count we would have one and a two and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.200 
count we would have one and a two and
three<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.280> four<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:12.190> gives<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:12.640> sort<00:01:13.000> of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
three and four and it gives this sort of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.700 
three and four and it gives this sort of
rolling<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.369> swing<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.420> but<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.440> best

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
rolling kind of swing to it but the best

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.830 
rolling kind of swing to it but the best
idea<00:01:18.220> is<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.550> listen<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.150> couple<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.570> song

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
idea is to listen to a couple of song

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.920 
idea is to listen to a couple of song
examples<00:01:20.500> with<00:01:20.740> this<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.310> first<00:01:22.150> example<00:01:22.720> would

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
examples with this a first example would

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.020 
examples with this a first example would
be<00:01:22.960> more<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.470> kintyre<00:01:24.040> which<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.729> intro<00:01:24.970> of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
be more of kintyre which the intro of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.830 
be more of kintyre which the intro of
which

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.889 

you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:33.020> tell<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.350> has<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.859> one<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:34.789> A<00:01:35.240> two

couple of one and A two and three and
four

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.120 

and<00:02:53.950> pause<00:02:54.370> there<00:02:55.470> that's<00:02:56.470> essentially<00:02:57.100> all

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
and pause there that's essentially all

and pause there that's essentially all
we're<00:02:57.400> going<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> cover<00:02:57.850> with<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.420> it's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
we're going to cover with this one it's

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.840 
we're going to cover with this one it's
just<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.960> count<00:02:59.350> that's<00:02:59.620> very<00:02:59.950> different<00:03:00.490> so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
just the count that's very different so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.300 
just the count that's very different so
to<00:03:00.940> recap<00:03:01.450> about<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> time<00:03:02.110> signatures<00:03:02.710> for

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
to recap about the time signatures for

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.700 
to recap about the time signatures for
four<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.880> four<00:03:04.270> beats<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.750> bar<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
four is four beats in the bar like the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.040 
four is four beats in the bar like the
first<00:03:05.920> string<00:03:06.220> pattern<00:03:06.490> we<00:03:06.580> went<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.420> two

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
first string pattern we went for one two

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.770 
first string pattern we went for one two
three<00:03:08.890> four<00:03:09.430> or<00:03:09.880> any<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> eighth

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
three four or any of the eighth

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.290 
three four or any of the eighth
strumming<00:03:11.500> patterns<00:03:11.890> one<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.670> two<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.240> three

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
strumming patterns one and two and three

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.600 
strumming patterns one and two and three
and<00:03:14.080> four<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.770> one<00:03:15.070> two<00:03:15.670> three<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:18.430> we

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and four and one two three and then we

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.460 
and four and one two three and then we
have<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.000> triplet<00:03:19.480> strumming<00:03:20.110> pattern

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
have this triplet strumming pattern

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.460 
have this triplet strumming pattern
which<00:03:20.680> adds<00:03:20.980> three<00:03:21.430> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.270> time<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.780> two<00:03:23.080> for

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
which adds three in the time of two for

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.460 
which adds three in the time of two for
each<00:03:23.590> B<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.190> rather<00:03:25.000> than<00:03:25.210> one<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.720> four<00:03:26.440> a

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
each B so rather than one and four a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.070 
each B so rather than one and four a
beat<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.160> one<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.850> one

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.040 

and<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> triplet<00:03:35.790> strumming<00:03:36.180> okay

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
and that is triplet strumming okay

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.510 
and that is triplet strumming okay
that's<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.440> end<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.800> particular<00:03:38.160> one

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
that's the end of this particular one

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.160 
that's the end of this particular one
we're<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> get<00:03:39.180> straight<00:03:39.420> onto<00:03:39.690> an

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
we're going to get straight onto an

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.920 
we're going to get straight onto an
strumming<00:03:41.070> pattern<00:03:41.370> eight<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.540> next

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
strumming pattern eight and this next

section of strumming patterns after this

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.090 
section of strumming patterns after this
video<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.480> three<00:03:46.410> most<00:03:46.860> common

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
video are the three most common

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.190 
video are the three most common
strumming<00:03:47.880> patterns<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.450> will<00:03:48.570> be<00:03:48.750> used<00:03:48.960> for

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
strumming patterns that will be used for

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.560 
strumming patterns that will be used for
every<00:03:49.710> musical<00:03:50.280> situation<00:03:51.120> these<00:03:51.300> are<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
every musical situation these are the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.600 
every musical situation these are the
big<00:03:51.810> guns<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.740> you're<00:03:52.890> going<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.130> be<00:03:53.220> using

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
big guns that you're going to be using

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.790 
big guns that you're going to be using
all<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.060> time<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.630> hopefully<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.620> work

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
all the time and hopefully the work

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.220 
all the time and hopefully the work
you've<00:03:56.040> put<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.400> far<00:03:56.910> will<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.930> pay<00:03:58.200> off

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
you've put in so far will really pay off

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.710 
you've put in so far will really pay off
in<00:03:58.620> these<00:03:58.950> next<00:03:59.280> three<00:03:59.700> strumming<00:04:00.390> patterns

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
in these next three strumming patterns

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.970 
in these next three strumming patterns
that<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.020> going<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.230> learn<00:04:01.410> up<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:01.800> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
that you're going to learn up with the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.610 
that you're going to learn up with the
songs<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.700> can<00:04:02.730> share<00:04:03.600> kiss<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.410> use

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
songs that you can share kiss that use

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.290 
songs that you can share kiss that use
these<00:04:04.860> strumming<00:04:05.280> patterns<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:05.880> I'll<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.240> you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
these strumming patterns so I'll see you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:36.140 
these strumming patterns so I'll see you
in<00:04:06.510> those<00:04:06.660> next<00:04:07.020> lessons

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150
