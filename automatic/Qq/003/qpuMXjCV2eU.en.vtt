00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:09.990
Hi! Today I'm here with my friends Tanausú and Dani and we just made a video

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
trying Bertie Bott's every flavour bean. It's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.110
in the description box if you want to check it out

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.699
We suffered a lot so now let's remove that horrible taste

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:29.499
with two things. The first are some slug gummies also from Harry Potter they are

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.859
it's an allusion to that scene in which Ron bewitch himself and all that stuff. And there are

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.019
different flavors.

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:44.070
Pear favor, sour cherry, cereza ácida.
Tangerine mandarina, I'm the translator. Watermelon,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.890
sandía and banana y plátano. From Canarias?
Because if it isn't I don't like it. It doesn't

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.480
have the sticker.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.429
And the other thing that we're going to try here our friend Dani introduce us this gourmet butterscotch beer.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.249
It's not gourmet but well...

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.410
I watch it with desire. Let's try those two things. By the way it doesn't have alcohol,  obviously

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.610
we're responsible, and we need to lead by example on this society.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.090
And what do we tried first, I want to take off this horrible taste in my mouth. Okay.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:26.940
So do the honors. It smells good, really good. It's like paradise

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.990
after those beans.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.350
Well after the beans this is amazing. Who starts? You, me? Okay. It looks like a dragon.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.120
Yes mora than slugs they look like... not slugs. It's Toothless, yeah.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:48.350
I want one of these too, I want a green one. Watermelon. Well it's not that good

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:58.060
as I was expecting. This watermelon disappointed me. The cherry was good. Ah no! I think that one

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.200
is pear. The watermelon one is good but they aren't amazing. You're right I've tried

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:14.950
better watermelon flavored things. The pear one wasn't that...

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850
Going to try the cherry one. Orange? That's tangerine. Is the cherry one good? Yes

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.610
it's really nice.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:29.000
The texture is a bit, different right? Of what we always try. I want to try a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.750
tangerine one. Is it nice? The texture is like if it was... oh my god you smell like tangerine

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.850
the smell is really strong.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.860
And there is the banana one left. And your cherry one and pear. It's good

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.390
but at the end it's a bit bitter.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:51.580
The sourness. Tastes a lot. It's
so real. I don't know what is that smell it...

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.200
put it inside your nose. It's green. Nice observation! It's pear, it is?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:06.610
If you don't know what it is... it's pear. I want a banana one. Yes I like it. It tastes

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.600
like normal banana gummies. But the colour is a bit weird right? And

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600
they don't look like slugs they look like dragons. The slugs are a lie.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.200
It has scales and all look. They are baby dragons. Khaleesi's are

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.819
wyvern. They are aceptable. My favorites were they cherry and tangerine 
and mine

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.190
are cherry and tangerine too. They aren't the typical gummies that give you

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.550
that flavor explosion they are like well meh.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.709
And the watermelon we love watermelon candies but this one was a bit dissapointing.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.470
Yes, in general they are good. I really like the texture. Man

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.630
qyou give me this after those beans and well everything is good after that.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.540
Yes the texture is nice even so they are dragons and not slugs. I think

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.610
they could make them look more real. Like sticky or something gross like that.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.650
Yes that you touch them and they are weird. But yes.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:26.479
And now... the moment that I've been waiting all my life. Who opens it? Do I?

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:39.139
Do the honors. Nobody says that it had gas. It smells a lot like butter and vanilla.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:54.599
It smells like those butter popcorn. Roscas.
Cotufas. Your face says no. You were like no

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.029
but then went yes.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:04.669
At first I was like, what is this? But is not that bad.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:12.240
Let me drink, yes we use the same bottle because we're frinds. You'll see in the comments

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:24.379
"ewww gross you drink from the same bottle".

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.889
It taste like if you were drinking vanilla ice-cream, but at first it doesn't get in

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:38.629
and after that it goes better. And the beer too.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:45.569
What does Dani Ray think about or beer? It needs alcohol, well if it had it

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.360
it will be better. But the flavor is really nice.  You know

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:59.830
that most of my subs are under age? Yeah? No no, it doesn't need alochol

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.119
it's perfect.

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:06.830
This is the cool part that came with the beer, but there's only one. I should've

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.339
bought more. We give a pass to the beer because right now we're just going

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:17.830
to drink it and that's it. Well I give it a seven. I think I give it a

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.300
eight it could be worse.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.770
It could be worse but it could be better.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.430
But is it good enough to not be bad.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:38.520
And you Dani what do you think? A seven. Because the flavor is nice, it has the tiene

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.240
butter taste, then the gas, the vanilla, it gives you that sensation.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.759
But it could be more I don't know. It needs something. One thing that was really nice is

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.409
that it doesn't contains gluten or other things like that. Average note is 7,25.

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.809
And that's it. That was the video if you want to watch us trying the beans as I said

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:03.889
you'll have the link of that video at the end of this one.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:11.369
Or in the description box, so you can watch us suffer. That's what people

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.139
like, right? And again these are Tana and Dani, Dani and Tana... Tani or Dana.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.409
And that's it. Thank you ver much for watching this video and see you on the next one, bye!
