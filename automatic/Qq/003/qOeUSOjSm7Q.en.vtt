do to someone else's computer and really

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.939 
do to someone else's computer and really
only<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.360> only<00:00:15.540> hard<00:00:15.870> part<00:00:15.929> about<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> is

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
only the only hard part about this is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.370 
only the only hard part about this is
getting<00:00:17.130> someone<00:00:17.550> else's<00:00:17.850> IP<00:00:18.119> address<00:00:18.900> their

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
getting someone else's IP address their

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.359 
getting someone else's IP address their
computer<00:00:19.830> address<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:21.350> I'm<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
computer address now I'm I have not I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.939 
computer address now I'm I have not I
don't<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> also<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> Xboxes

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
don't know if this also works and Xboxes

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.300 
don't know if this also works and Xboxes
or<00:00:26.099> ps3's<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.910> whatnot<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:28.439> best<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
or ps3's and whatnot but my best get is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.290 
or ps3's and whatnot but my best get is
best<00:00:29.789> guess<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.199> doesn't<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.309> mean<00:00:33.210> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
best guess is it doesn't so I mean you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
best guess is it doesn't so I mean you
can<00:00:33.450> try<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.110> sure<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
can try it but I'm not sure that it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
can try it but I'm not sure that it
works<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.820> um<00:00:36.030> again<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> hard<00:00:36.960> part<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
works but um again the hard part is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
works but um again the hard part is
getting<00:00:37.350> someone<00:00:37.829> eise's<00:00:37.950> IP<00:00:38.370> someone<00:00:39.180> else's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
getting someone eise's IP someone else's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.380 
getting someone eise's IP someone else's
IP<00:00:39.600> address<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> mean<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:41.940> also

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
IP address I mean you can really also

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
IP address I mean you can really also
you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.870> look<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.440> YouTube<00:00:43.910> it's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you can just look it up on YouTube it's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
you can just look it up on YouTube it's
it's<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.350> easy<00:00:46.379> you're

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it's kind of actually really easy you're

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's kind of actually really easy you're
just<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:47.100> IP<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> hacker<00:00:49.530> thing<00:00:50.039> whatever

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just gonna IP the hacker thing whatever

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
just gonna IP the hacker thing whatever

doesn't<00:03:51.989> there<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.980> teacher<00:03:53.160> does<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
doesn't there and the teacher does it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.159 
doesn't there and the teacher does it
then<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.209> know<00:03:54.329> what<00:03:54.450> sharing<00:03:54.840> your<00:03:54.959> screen

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
then you know what sharing your screen

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.809 
then you know what sharing your screen
looks<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:55.889> if<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.069> don't<00:03:56.280> sharing<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
looks like but if you don't sharing the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.789 
looks like but if you don't sharing the
screen<00:03:56.910> basically<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.660> what<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.349> sounds<00:03:58.650> like

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
screen basically is what it sounds like

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.550 
screen basically is what it sounds like
if<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.519> shared<00:04:00.209> my<00:04:00.359> screen<00:04:00.720> with<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> connected

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
if I shared my screen with a connected

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.319 
if I shared my screen with a connected
computer<00:04:02.069> you're<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.430> let's<00:04:02.730> say<00:04:02.879> my<00:04:03.120> mom's

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
computer you're like let's say my mom's

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.330 
computer you're like let's say my mom's
computer<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.079> connected<00:04:04.739> my<00:04:04.769> computer<00:04:05.220> her

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
computer I connected my computer her

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.990 
computer I connected my computer her
computer

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
computer

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.369 
computer
yeah<00:04:06.299> whatever<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:07.799> would<00:04:07.919> show<00:04:08.129> my<00:04:08.280> cam<00:04:08.430> my

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
yeah whatever it would show my cam my

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.199 
yeah whatever it would show my cam my
screen<00:04:10.379> on<00:04:10.590> her<00:04:10.739> screen<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.730> she<00:04:11.849> couldn't<00:04:12.150> do

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
screen on her screen but she couldn't do

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.400 
screen on her screen but she couldn't do
anything<00:04:12.419> anyways

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
anything anyways

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.900 
anything anyways
but<00:04:14.410> that's<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.950> opposite<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:15.730> case

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
but that's the opposite in this case

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.569 
but that's the opposite in this case
this<00:04:16.359> is<00:04:16.419> basically<00:04:17.139> more<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.769> can<00:04:18.040> shares

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
this is basically more this can shares

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.750 
this is basically more this can shares
their<00:04:19.540> screen<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.989> ears<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.709> at<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.549> same

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
their screen the ears and at the same

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.300 
their screen the ears and at the same
time<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.210> can<00:04:22.360> control<00:04:22.810> her<00:04:22.930> computer<00:04:23.410> now<00:04:23.950> I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
time you can control her computer now I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.570 
time you can control her computer now I
know<00:04:24.520> I've<00:04:24.970> seen<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.389> my<00:04:25.570> school<00:04:26.340> people<00:04:27.340> take

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
know I've seen in my school people take

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.000 
know I've seen in my school people take
over<00:04:27.880> my<00:04:28.030> computer<00:04:28.450> kind<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.710> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
over my computer kind of like this and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.680 
over my computer kind of like this and
it's<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.340> little<00:04:30.610> weird<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.090> I've<00:04:31.240> always<00:04:31.450> want
