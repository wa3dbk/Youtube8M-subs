newsletter that's a that's actually not

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.480 
newsletter that's a that's actually not
bad<00:03:59.110> that's<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.560> pretty<00:03:59.770> good<00:04:00.040> conversion

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
bad that's a pretty good conversion

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.310 
bad that's a pretty good conversion
ratio<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.600> course<00:04:01.780> we're<00:04:01.930> given<00:04:02.140> something

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
ratio of course we're given something

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.540 
ratio of course we're given something
away<00:04:02.590> for<00:04:02.770> free<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.100> not<00:04:03.250> like<00:04:03.400> we're

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
away for free it's not like we're

charging<00:04:03.910> money<00:04:04.060> for<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.570> so<00:04:05.050> maybe<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> should

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
charging money for it so maybe it should

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.690 
charging money for it so maybe it should
be<00:04:05.590> higher<00:04:05.680> than<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.220> but<00:04:06.400> that's<00:04:06.550> actually

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
be higher than that but that's actually

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.770 
be higher than that but that's actually
not<00:04:06.910> bad<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:08.350> 1206<00:04:08.980> p.m.<00:04:09.490> we<00:04:10.150> launched<00:04:10.480> four
