well it looks a lot like chicken wire

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
well it looks a lot like chicken wire
because<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.500> thicker

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that you get now in the early days of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
that you get now in the early days of
stucco<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.910> remember<00:00:48.239> remodeling<00:00:48.840> old

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
stucco and I remember remodeling old

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
stucco and I remember remodeling old
houses<00:00:49.620> back<00:00:49.800> east<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.730> been<00:00:51.000> stuccoed

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
houses back east that had been stuccoed

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
houses back east that had been stuccoed
but<00:00:51.870> underneath<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> stucco<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.160> old

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
but underneath the stucco it was an old

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
but underneath the stucco it was an old
clobbered<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.660> would<00:00:54.809> indeed<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.379> use

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
clobbered and they would indeed just use

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
clobbered and they would indeed just use
chicken<00:00:55.770> wire<00:00:56.010> put<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.789> over<00:00:56.850> there

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
chicken wire put it right over there

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
chicken wire put it right over there
yeah<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> course<00:00:57.809> after<00:00:58.140> 50<00:00:58.440> years<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> was

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
yeah of course after 50 years it was

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.490 
yeah of course after 50 years it was
pretty<00:00:58.949> rusted<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.579> how<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.820> would<00:00:59.910> fail

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
pretty rusted that's how it would fail

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
pretty rusted that's how it would fail
is<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:02.250> anything<00:01:02.399> special<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is there anything special about the the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
is there anything special about the the
the<00:01:04.170> mix<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:05.070> being<00:01:05.280> applied<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.939> now

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the mix that's being applied right now

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.679 
the mix that's being applied right now
the<00:01:06.390> mix<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.409> three<00:01:08.070> parts<00:01:08.490> sand<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the mix right now is three parts sand to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.920 
the mix right now is three parts sand to
one<00:01:09.900> part<00:01:10.229> plastic<00:01:10.770> cement<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.720> then<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
one part plastic cement and then the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
one part plastic cement and then the
appropriate<00:01:13.110> amount<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> water<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.340> not

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
appropriate amount of water so it's not

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
appropriate amount of water so it's not
Portland<00:01:14.970> cement<00:01:15.330> no<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.930> plastic<00:01:16.350> cement

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
Portland cement no it's plastic cement

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
Portland cement no it's plastic cement
and<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.549> does<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:17.970> us<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> plastic

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and what does that do for us the plastic

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.249 
and what does that do for us the plastic
the<00:01:19.409> plastics<00:01:19.860> inside<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.430> give<00:01:20.640> us<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the plastics inside there give us a

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
the plastics inside there give us a
helps<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> moisture<00:01:22.799> barrier<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.880> with

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
helps with the moisture barrier and with

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.499 
helps with the moisture barrier and with
the<00:01:24.750> wall<00:01:25.200> actually<00:01:25.439> giving<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:27.360> bit

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the wall actually giving it a little bit

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.230 
the wall actually giving it a little bit
of<00:01:27.630> elasticity<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> okay<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of elasticity to it okay now could this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
of elasticity to it okay now could this
be<00:01:30.619> sprayed<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> way<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.850> job<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.420> many

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
be sprayed on the way a good job as many

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170 
be sprayed on the way a good job as many
times<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.409> larger<00:01:35.310> jobs<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.909> bring<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
times on larger jobs we will bring a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
times on larger jobs we will bring a
stucco<00:01:36.450> pump<00:01:36.780> gun<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.500> actually

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
stucco pump gun here and we actually

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
stucco pump gun here and we actually
have<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> mixer<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> pump<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.259> it's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have a mixer on the pump and then it's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.810 
have a mixer on the pump and then it's
