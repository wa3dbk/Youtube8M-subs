00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
will have to be two forced blinds let's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810 
will have to be two forced blinds let's
make<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.450> case<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.470> two<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
make it in this case one and two so this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
make it in this case one and two so this
will<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> small<00:01:15.570> blind<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.590> would

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
will be the small blind and this would

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850 
will be the small blind and this would
be<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> big<00:01:17.250> blind<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.689> coin<00:01:19.380> here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
be the big blind you have one coin here

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.370 
be the big blind you have one coin here
and<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.369> chips<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and two chips here so that would be the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.370 
and two chips here so that would be the
equivalent<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.640> big<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.240> small<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.170> big

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
equivalent of the big and small the big

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
equivalent of the big and small the big
and<00:01:25.560> small<00:01:25.830> blind<00:01:26.659> continuing<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.860> start

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and small blind continuing on we start

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.670 
and small blind continuing on we start
the<00:01:29.460> shuffling<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.299> game<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.320> deal

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the shuffling of the game I would deal

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.600
