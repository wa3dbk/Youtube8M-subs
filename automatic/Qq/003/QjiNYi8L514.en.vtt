it<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> x1<00:02:08.250> despite<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> fact<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
it with the x1 despite the fact that it

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.530 
it with the x1 despite the fact that it
does<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> funnel<00:02:10.500> drive<00:02:10.739> buyers<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:12.420> do

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
does have a funnel drive buyers you do

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.330 
does have a funnel drive buyers you do
of<00:02:12.690> course<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.989> multiple<00:02:13.800> modes<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.190> this

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
of course have multiple modes for this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.830 
of course have multiple modes for this
car<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.120> put<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.570> into

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
car so you can actually put this into

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 
car so you can actually put this into
sport<00:02:16.380> mode<00:02:16.440> which<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.220> give<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.610> car<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
sport mode which will give the car a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.280 
sport mode which will give the car a
little<00:02:18.090> bit<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> different<00:02:18.930> throttle

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
little bit of a different throttle

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
little bit of a different throttle
mapping<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.890> well<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.280> slightly<00:02:20.700> heavier

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
mapping as well as slightly heavier

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.610 
mapping as well as slightly heavier
steering<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.049> first<00:02:22.170> time<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
steering that it's the first time you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.470 
steering that it's the first time you
can<00:02:22.739> actually<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.160> variable<00:02:23.790> steering<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
can actually get variable steering in a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.990 
can actually get variable steering in a
BMW<00:02:24.720> x1<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.890> well<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.340> adaptive<00:02:26.820> suspension

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
BMW x1 as well as adaptive suspension

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
BMW x1 as well as adaptive suspension
now<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.989> course<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.440> rows<00:02:28.680> are<00:02:28.860> very<00:02:29.010> smooth

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
now of course these rows are very smooth

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.009 
now of course these rows are very smooth
so<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:29.640> very<00:02:29.820> hard<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> tell<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> how

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
so it's very hard for me to tell you how

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.690 
so it's very hard for me to tell you how
we'll<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.739> gets<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.040> Australia<00:02:32.519> but

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
we'll go when it gets to Australia but

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.370 
we'll go when it gets to Australia but
first<00:02:32.940> impressions<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.840> actually<00:02:34.110> arrived

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
first impressions it actually arrived

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.040 
first impressions it actually arrived
really<00:02:34.709> nicely<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.489> hope

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
really nicely I hope

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:48.259 
really nicely I hope
translates<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.770> Australia

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.880 

driving<00:02:49.269> dynamics<00:02:49.840> aside<00:02:50.230> I'm<00:02:50.469> actually<00:02:50.829> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
driving dynamics aside I'm actually a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.830 
driving dynamics aside I'm actually a
really<00:02:51.159> big<00:02:51.519> fan<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.269> car's<00:02:52.569> interior

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
really big fan of this car's interior

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.740 
really big fan of this car's interior
I've<00:02:53.709> got<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.069> really<00:02:54.340> nice<00:02:54.609> big<00:02:55.150> tablet

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
I've got this really nice big tablet

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.720 
I've got this really nice big tablet
like<00:02:56.079> screen<00:02:56.439> here<00:02:56.739> which<00:02:57.099> comes<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.519> and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
like screen here which comes down and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.459 
like screen here which comes down and
connects<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.239> iDrive<00:02:58.719> system<00:02:58.780> which<00:02:59.290> now

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
connects to the iDrive system which now

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.229 
connects to the iDrive system which now
I<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.680> is<00:03:00.010> still<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.730> best<00:03:00.879> in<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
I think is still the best in the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.030 
I think is still the best in the
business<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.780> course<00:03:02.200> they've<00:03:02.379> also<00:03:02.500> improved

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
business of course they've also improved

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.300 
business of course they've also improved
the<00:03:03.189> cars<00:03:03.459> cargo<00:03:03.909> capacity<00:03:04.060> now<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.310> 505

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the cars cargo capacity now at 505

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.580 
the cars cargo capacity now at 505
litres<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.689> you<00:03:08.019> want<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.230> put<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.439> rear

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
litres so if you want to put the rear

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.259 
litres so if you want to put the rear
seats<00:03:08.799> down<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.159> could<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.670> 40<00:03:10.030> by<00:03:10.209> 20

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
seats down you could do it in a 40 by 20

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.929 
seats down you could do it in a 40 by 20
by<00:03:10.719> 40<00:03:11.079> combination<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.739> also<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.579> front

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
by 40 combination and also the front

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.059 
by 40 combination and also the front
passenger<00:03:13.420> seat<00:03:13.629> falls<00:03:13.900> completely<00:03:14.109> flat<00:03:14.709> so

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
passenger seat falls completely flat so

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.319 
passenger seat falls completely flat so
if<00:03:15.129> you<00:03:15.189> got<00:03:15.310> something<00:03:15.549> up<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.239> a

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
if you got something up to two and a

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.240 
if you got something up to two and a
half<00:03:16.480> metres<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.900> length<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.500> now<00:03:17.680> fits<00:03:17.920> into

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
half metres in length it now fits into

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.979 
half metres in length it now fits into
this<00:03:18.370> car<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.849> says<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.150> considering

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
this car and that says a lot considering

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.869 
this car and that says a lot considering
the<00:03:20.230> car<00:03:20.439> itself<00:03:20.859> measures<00:03:21.099> less<00:03:21.430> than<00:03:21.609> four

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
the car itself measures less than four

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.620 
the car itself measures less than four
and<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> half<00:03:22.030> meters

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.650 

my<00:03:27.500> overall<00:03:27.920> impression<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.880> car<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.360> very

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
my overall impression of the car is very

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.510 
my overall impression of the car is very
positive<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.500> we<00:03:30.590> don't<00:03:30.770> know<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> pricing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
positive that we don't know the pricing

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.550 
positive that we don't know the pricing
and<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:32.240> know<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.420> spec<00:03:32.900> level<00:03:33.200> at<00:03:33.380> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
and we don't know the spec level at this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.650 
and we don't know the spec level at this
very<00:03:33.770> moment<00:03:34.040> but<00:03:34.460> if<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.120> comes<00:03:35.330> in<00:03:35.480> at<00:03:35.600> a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
very moment but if it comes in at a

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.970 
very moment but if it comes in at a
reasonable<00:03:36.050> price<00:03:36.200> compared<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.890> this

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
reasonable price compared to this

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.650 
reasonable price compared to this
competition<00:03:37.280> at<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.760> reasonable

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
competition at a reasonable

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.360 
competition at a reasonable
specification<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.920> think<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.220> will<00:03:40.280> be

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
specification then I think it will be

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.130 
specification then I think it will be
quite<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.820> winner<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.420> segment<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.930> new

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
quite a winner in the segment the new

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.890 
quite a winner in the segment the new
BMW<00:03:45.380> x1<00:03:46.040> range<00:03:46.460> will<00:03:46.730> arrive<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.150> Australia<00:03:47.270> in

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
BMW x1 range will arrive in Australia in

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.140 
BMW x1 range will arrive in Australia in
October<00:03:48.020> of<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.770> year<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.490> check<00:03:49.910> back<00:03:50.120> soon
