often hear people say in nature animals
kill<00:00:17.420> other<00:00:17.660> animals<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.170> eat<00:00:18.289> them<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:18.619> it's

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
kill other animals and eat them so it's

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.310 
kill other animals and eat them so it's
natural<00:00:19.279> for<00:00:19.460> us<00:00:19.490> to<00:00:19.760> do<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.090> as<00:00:20.240> well<00:00:20.270> it's<00:00:21.260> the

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
natural for us to do so as well it's the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.700 
natural for us to do so as well it's the
natural<00:00:21.500> course<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.039> things<00:00:22.100> its<00:00:22.640> nature

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
natural course of things its nature

natural course of things its nature
here's<00:00:24.710> my<00:00:24.920> point<00:00:25.130> of<00:00:25.280> view<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:26.120> one

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
here's my point of view this one

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.660 
here's my point of view this one
confuses<00:00:26.900> me<00:00:27.020> a<00:00:27.050> little<00:00:27.350> bit<00:00:27.470> because<00:00:27.770> I<00:00:28.310> have

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
confuses me a little bit because I have

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.700 
confuses me a little bit because I have
to<00:00:28.820> ask<00:00:28.970> which<00:00:29.510> animals<00:00:29.990> are<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.380> referring

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
to ask which animals are you referring

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.390 
to ask which animals are you referring
to

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.959 
to
if<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.000> assertion<00:00:32.599> is<00:00:32.930> in<00:00:33.320> nature

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
if the assertion is in nature

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.220 
if the assertion is in nature
carnivorous<00:00:34.969> animals<00:00:35.719> kill<00:00:35.960> other<00:00:36.170> animals

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
carnivorous animals kill other animals

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.709 
carnivorous animals kill other animals
and<00:00:36.829> eat<00:00:37.100> them<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:37.850> natural<00:00:38.270> for<00:00:38.449> us<00:00:38.480> to

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
and eat them so it's natural for us to

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.410 
and eat them so it's natural for us to
do<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.109> then<00:00:39.769> I<00:00:39.800> would<00:00:39.949> say<00:00:40.249> yeah<00:00:40.819> the<00:00:41.149> first

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
do so then I would say yeah the first

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.669 
do so then I would say yeah the first
part<00:00:41.839> of<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.019> is<00:00:42.140> true

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
part of that is true

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.380 
part of that is true
carnivorous<00:00:43.039> animals<00:00:43.699> do<00:00:43.940> kill<00:00:44.210> other

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
carnivorous animals do kill other

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.319 
carnivorous animals do kill other
animals<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:45.019> survive<00:00:45.199> that's<00:00:45.890> natural<00:00:46.609> indeed

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
animals to survive that's natural indeed

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.719 
animals to survive that's natural indeed
however<00:00:48.140> humans<00:00:48.620> are<00:00:48.800> not<00:00:48.979> physiologically

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
however humans are not physiologically

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.389 
however humans are not physiologically
built<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:50.149> carnivores<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.140> why<00:00:51.620> should<00:00:51.949> we<00:00:51.979> do

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
built as carnivores so why should we do

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.000 
built as carnivores so why should we do
what<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.819> obligate<00:00:53.329> carnivores<00:00:53.929> do<00:00:54.289> after

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
what the obligate carnivores do after

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.680 
what the obligate carnivores do after
all<00:00:55.039> they<00:00:55.399> would<00:00:55.579> die<00:00:55.909> without<00:00:56.389> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
all they would die without the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.619 
all they would die without the
consumption<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.350> flesh<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.859> we<00:00:58.429> thrive<00:00:58.909> but

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
consumption of flesh and we thrive but

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.419 
consumption of flesh and we thrive but
that's<00:00:59.809> not<00:01:00.019> usually<00:01:00.469> what<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.710> assertion<00:01:01.249> is

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
that's not usually what the assertion is

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.869 
that's not usually what the assertion is
it's<00:01:01.940> often<00:01:02.239> phrased<00:01:02.719> just<00:01:03.409> as<00:01:03.710> animals<00:01:04.699> eat

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
it's often phrased just as animals eat

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.550 
it's often phrased just as animals eat
other<00:01:05.030> animals<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:05.870> it's<00:01:06.020> natural<00:01:06.380> for<00:01:06.409> us

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
other animals and so it's natural for us

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.460 
other animals and so it's natural for us
to<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:07.400> well<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:09.080> would<00:01:09.200> ask

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
to do so as well and to that I would ask

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.399 
to do so as well and to that I would ask
why<00:01:10.220> are<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.610> eliminating<00:01:10.850> all<00:01:11.539> of<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.049> plant

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
why are we eliminating all of the plant

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.980 
why are we eliminating all of the plant
eating<00:01:12.619> animals<00:01:13.159> for<00:01:13.399> whom<00:01:13.579> it's<00:01:13.880> not<00:01:14.210> natural

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
eating animals for whom it's not natural

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.889 
eating animals for whom it's not natural
to<00:01:15.229> eat<00:01:16.130> other<00:01:16.340> animals<00:01:16.430> why<00:01:17.299> don't<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:17.659> use

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
to eat other animals why don't we use

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.080 
to eat other animals why don't we use
the<00:01:18.049> plant<00:01:18.350> eating<00:01:18.560> animals<00:01:19.159> as<00:01:19.280> our<00:01:19.460> model<00:01:19.909> as

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the plant eating animals as our model as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.999 
the plant eating animals as our model as
the<00:01:20.149> barometer<00:01:20.930> for<00:01:21.200> our<00:01:21.259> behavior

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
the barometer for our behavior

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.160 
the barometer for our behavior
why<00:01:22.280> do<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.549> align<00:01:22.850> ourselves<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:24.049> the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
why do we align ourselves with the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.410 
why do we align ourselves with the
carnivorous<00:01:24.500> lion<00:01:25.100> rather<00:01:25.850> than<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
carnivorous lion rather than with the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.529 
carnivorous lion rather than with the
vegetarian<00:01:27.380> elephant<00:01:28.159> we<00:01:28.579> never<00:01:28.789> say<00:01:29.030> well

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
vegetarian elephant we never say well

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.539 
vegetarian elephant we never say well
animals<00:01:30.020> don't<00:01:30.259> eat<00:01:30.530> other<00:01:30.680> animals<00:01:31.219> so<00:01:31.399> it's

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
animals don't eat other animals so it's

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.330 
animals don't eat other animals so it's
natural<00:01:32.240> for<00:01:32.270> us<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.780> do<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.049> same<00:01:33.259> or<00:01:33.590> if

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
natural for us to do the same or if

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.359 
natural for us to do the same or if
animals<00:01:34.820> eat<00:01:35.240> only<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.659> plant<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:36.920> natural

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
animals eat only a plant so it's natural

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.399 
animals eat only a plant so it's natural
for<00:01:37.579> us<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.700> do<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> same<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.659> don't<00:01:38.840> say<00:01:39.140> that

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
for us to do the same we don't say that

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.380 
for us to do the same we don't say that
when<00:01:39.890> people<00:01:40.280> make<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.579> generalization

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
when people make the generalization

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.419 
when people make the generalization
animals<00:01:42.170> eat<00:01:42.380> other<00:01:42.560> animals<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.310> it's

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
animals eat other animals so it's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.429 
animals eat other animals so it's
natural<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:43.939> us<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.689> they're<00:01:45.259> leaving

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
natural for us to do so they're leaving

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.090 
natural for us to do so they're leaving
out<00:01:45.969> hundreds<00:01:46.969> of<00:01:47.270> species<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:48.109> animals<00:01:48.890> who

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
out hundreds of species of animals who

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.730 
out hundreds of species of animals who
don't<00:01:49.429> eat<00:01:49.880> other<00:01:50.149> animals<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.049> in<00:01:51.469> fact

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
don't eat other animals and in fact

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.039 
don't eat other animals and in fact
there<00:01:52.189> are<00:01:52.219> more<00:01:52.820> herbivorous<00:01:53.509> animals<00:01:53.719> in

there are more herbivorous animals in

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.300 
there are more herbivorous animals in
the<00:01:54.140> world<00:01:54.289> than<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:54.649> are<00:01:54.710> carnivorous

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the world than there are carnivorous

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.179 
the world than there are carnivorous
ones<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> herbivores<00:01:57.200> are<00:01:57.499> never<00:01:57.890> used

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189
