dancers<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.650> dance<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.640> works<00:02:20.940> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
dancers to dance to that it works it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.900 
dancers to dance to that it works it
sometimes<00:02:22.260> not<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.560> easy<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.459> musicians

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
sometimes not as easy for the musicians

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.500 
sometimes not as easy for the musicians
and<00:02:24.590> some<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.709> these<00:02:25.830> pieces<00:02:26.129> if<00:02:26.459> performed<00:02:27.300> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and some of these pieces if performed in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.330 
and some of these pieces if performed in
a<00:02:27.959> concert<00:02:28.379> setting<00:02:28.590> some<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> tempe

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
a concert setting some of the tempe

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.839 
a concert setting some of the tempe
might<00:02:29.549> be<00:02:29.760> quite<00:02:30.660> different<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.849> accommodate

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
might be quite different to accommodate

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.440 
might be quite different to accommodate
the<00:02:32.970> musicians<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.660> here<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.269> not

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the musicians and here that is just not

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
the musicians and here that is just not
possible<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.170> know<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.709> really<00:02:37.890> have<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
possible you know we really have to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.390 
possible you know we really have to
accommodate<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.819> dancers<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:40.310> that's<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
accommodate the dancers so that's a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.830 
accommodate the dancers so that's a
challenge<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.940> getting<00:02:42.269> off<00:02:42.660> itself<00:02:44.840> yeah

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
challenge in getting off itself yeah

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
challenge in getting off itself yeah
it's<00:02:46.170> actually<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.680> funny<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.040> actually<00:02:47.250> felt

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
it's actually so funny I actually felt

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
it's actually so funny I actually felt
like<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> gust<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.329> wind<00:02:48.410> when<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.739> by<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
like a gust of wind when to go by the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
like a gust of wind when to go by the
back<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.519> my<00:02:50.549> head<00:02:50.849> because<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.180> guess<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> dancer

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
back of my head because I guess a dancer

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.270 
back of my head because I guess a dancer
was<00:02:52.079> pretty<00:02:52.319> close<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> front<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
was pretty close to the front of the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.339 
was pretty close to the front of the
stage<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.269> like<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.260> don't

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
stage and it's just like you don't

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.680 
stage and it's just like you don't
expect<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.340> when<00:02:56.549> when<00:02:56.970> we're<00:02:57.660> on

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
expect that you know when when we're on

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
expect that you know when when we're on
stage<00:02:58.349> performing<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.129> our<00:02:59.220> concerts

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
stage performing one of our concerts

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.789 
stage performing one of our concerts
that's<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.260> worry<00:03:01.290> about<00:03:01.440> is

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
that's all we have to worry about is

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.589 
that's all we have to worry about is
just<00:03:01.980> like<00:03:02.220> our<00:03:02.400> music<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> conductor

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
just like our music and the conductor

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.100 
just like our music and the conductor
and<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.260> making<00:03:04.860> music<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.670> now<00:03:06.420> we

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
and you know making music and now we

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.780 
and you know making music and now we
have<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.440> fit<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.799> with<00:03:07.920> dancers<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.810> it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
have to fit it in with dancers and it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
have to fit it in with dancers and it's
challenging<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.000> way<00:03:12.470> I've<00:03:13.470> never<00:03:13.530> done

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
challenging in a way I've never done

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.100 
challenging in a way I've never done
that<00:03:14.190> before<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:15.299> sure<00:03:15.720> they<00:03:15.900> haven't

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
that before and I'm sure they haven't

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680 
that before and I'm sure they haven't
either<00:03:16.349> but<00:03:16.799> um<00:03:17.209> think<00:03:18.209> you're<00:03:18.359> making<00:03:18.600> it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
either but um think you're making it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.910 
either but um think you're making it
work

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.650 

I<00:03:20.980> came<00:03:21.700> from<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:21.940> musical<00:03:22.240> theatre<00:03:22.480> world

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
I came from the musical theatre world

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.170 
I came from the musical theatre world
where<00:03:22.959> I'm<00:03:23.080> used<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.650> always<00:03:24.130> performing<00:03:25.030> with

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
where I'm used to always performing with

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.680 
where I'm used to always performing with
live<00:03:25.360> music<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.650> for<00:03:26.980> me<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.220> seems<00:03:27.700> pretty

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
live music so if for me it seems pretty

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.080 
live music so if for me it seems pretty
normal<00:03:28.930> however<00:03:29.680> I've<00:03:29.980> also<00:03:30.400> never<00:03:30.670> performed

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
normal however I've also never performed

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.400 
normal however I've also never performed
with<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.270> full<00:03:31.480> orchestra<00:03:31.690> which<00:03:32.260> is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
with a full orchestra which is

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.120 
with a full orchestra which is
definitely<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:33.099> different<00:03:33.819> beast<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.360> itself

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.260 

I<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.690> definitely<00:03:41.090> invigorating<00:03:42.090> for

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
I think it's definitely invigorating for

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.370 
I think it's definitely invigorating for
the<00:03:42.360> dancers<00:03:42.660> when<00:03:42.810> you're<00:03:42.900> performing<00:03:43.050> with

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the dancers when you're performing with

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.410 
the dancers when you're performing with
live<00:03:43.620> powerful<00:03:44.370> music<00:03:44.520> with<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.970> not<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
live powerful music with you not just a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.540 
live powerful music with you not just a
recording<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.770> in<00:03:46.950> general<00:03:47.100> dance

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
recording and I think in general dance

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.100 
recording and I think in general dance
and<00:03:47.790> music<00:03:48.090> when<00:03:48.420> they<00:03:48.540> come<00:03:48.720> together<00:03:48.900> they

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
and music when they come together they

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.450 
and music when they come together they
should<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.590> know<00:03:49.680> create<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> synthesis<00:03:50.430> that

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
should you know create a synthesis that

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.130 
should you know create a synthesis that
creates<00:03:50.880> an<00:03:51.000> artwork<00:03:51.210> better<00:03:51.570> than<00:03:51.810> each<00:03:51.930> on

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
creates an artwork better than each on

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.770 
creates an artwork better than each on
its<00:03:52.290> own<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.490> that<00:03:53.850> if<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.420> dancers

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
its own so I think that if the dancers

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.270 
its own so I think that if the dancers
and<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.020> musicians<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.680> work<00:03:55.830> together<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and the musicians can work together and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.560 
and the musicians can work together and
feed<00:03:56.490> on<00:03:56.670> each<00:03:56.700> other<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.210> should<00:03:57.450> be

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
feed on each other it should be

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:08.559 
feed on each other it should be
something<00:03:57.780> absolutely<00:03:58.620> amazing

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.640 

performing<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.690> live<00:04:09.840> music<00:04:10.170> there's<00:04:10.349> nothing

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
performing to live music there's nothing

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.140 
performing to live music there's nothing
like<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.040> mean<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:11.280> lives<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.700> breathes<00:04:11.849> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
like it I mean it lives and breathes and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.890 
like it I mean it lives and breathes and
and<00:04:12.420> dances<00:04:12.930> along<00:04:13.049> with<00:04:13.440> with<00:04:14.069> them<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.670> it's

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
and dances along with with them so it's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:37.999 
and dances along with with them so it's
it's<00:04:15.900> really<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> treat

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.069 

you
