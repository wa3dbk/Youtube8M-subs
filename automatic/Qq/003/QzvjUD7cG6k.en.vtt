themselves listen to the coaches
learning<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.040> sport<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:05.820> more

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
learning a bit about sport but more

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.790 
learning a bit about sport but more
importantly<00:02:06.390> learning<00:02:07.170> how<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.710> with

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
importantly learning how to get on with

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.020 
importantly learning how to get on with
each<00:02:07.950> other<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.910> will

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
each other so I think this will

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
each other so I think this will
translate<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.660> only<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.959> sport<00:02:10.290> but

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
translate not only in the sport but

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.110 
translate not only in the sport but
hopefully<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> school<00:02:11.610> life<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:11.970> then

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
hopefully in this school life and then

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.020 
hopefully in this school life and then
life<00:02:12.780> after<00:02:13.140> school<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.160> about<00:02:14.550> ambition

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
life after school this is about ambition

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
life after school this is about ambition
it's<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.750> raising<00:02:16.050> expectations<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's about raising expectations it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100 
it's about raising expectations it's
about<00:02:17.520> children<00:02:18.000> seen<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.600> happen<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
about children seen what can happen the
