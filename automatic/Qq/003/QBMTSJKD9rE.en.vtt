but<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.450> gameplay<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.900> always<00:00:54.260> 2d<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.920> it's

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
but the gameplay is always 2d so it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.850 
but the gameplay is always 2d so it's
more<00:00:55.220> like<00:00:55.430> 2d<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.000> 2d<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.480> 2d<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.559> never<00:00:57.710> play

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
and this is really kind of a homage in a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.830 
and this is really kind of a homage in a
little<00:01:34.220> way<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.370> think<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.880> res<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.659> move

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
little way I think to res you move

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.590 
little way I think to res you move
around<00:01:35.960> using<00:01:36.320> WA<00:01:36.860> s<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.190> D<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.549> that's<00:01:38.479> how

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
around using WA s and D and that's how

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.990 
around using WA s and D and that's how
you<00:01:38.659> dodge<00:01:38.990> enemies<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.130> use<00:01:40.280> jkl

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you dodge enemies and then you use jkl

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.060 
you dodge enemies and then you use jkl
kind<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.930> guitar<00:01:42.200> hero<00:01:42.590> type<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.920> thing

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
kind of like a guitar hero type of thing

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.920 
kind of like a guitar hero type of thing
and<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.250> follow<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.610> rhythm<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.540> shoot

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
and you follow the rhythm so you shoot

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.380 
and you follow the rhythm so you shoot
by<00:01:45.440> following<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.920> rhythm<00:01:46.190> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
by following the rhythm and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.300 
by following the rhythm and
you<00:01:47.600> move<00:01:47.810> by<00:01:48.050> using<00:01:48.229> last<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:48.890> kind<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.159> an

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
you move by using last it's a kind of an

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.330 
you move by using last it's a kind of an
experience<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.270> multitasking<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.159> works

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
experience in multitasking but it works

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.160 
experience in multitasking but it works
surprisingly<00:01:53.150> well<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:53.930> not<00:01:54.020> as

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
surprisingly well it's not as

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.859 
surprisingly well it's not as
complicated<00:01:54.290> as<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.800> sounds<00:01:54.970> we<00:01:55.970> won<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.450> best

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
complicated as it sounds we won the best

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.700 
complicated as it sounds we won the best
student<00:01:57.320> showcase<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:59.020> man<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.290> did<00:02:00.530> not<00:02:00.560> think

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
student showcase and man I did not think

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.530 
student showcase and man I did not think
that<00:02:00.920> was<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.250> happen<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:02.030> was<00:02:02.210> quite<00:02:02.420> an

which<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> disappointment<00:02:12.920> because<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.340> love

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
which is a disappointment because I love

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.040 
which is a disappointment because I love
it<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.120> he<00:02:14.239> could<00:02:14.360> show<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.750> amazing

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
it if he could show you this amazing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.280 
it if he could show you this amazing
game<00:02:15.470> he<00:02:15.890> won<00:02:16.360> $25,000<00:02:17.360> grand<00:02:17.720> prize<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:17.989> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
game he won $25,000 grand prize for this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.140 
game he won $25,000 grand prize for this
which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.590> good<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.580> let's<00:02:19.670> take<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.940> look<00:02:20.090> at

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
which is good so let's take a look at

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.440 
which is good so let's take a look at
friend<00:02:20.420> physics<00:02:20.840> deluxe<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.280> see

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
friend physics deluxe as you can see

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.479 
friend physics deluxe as you can see
anything<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> draw<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.200> screen<00:02:24.489> turns

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
anything you draw on the screen turns

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.370 
anything you draw on the screen turns
into<00:02:25.760> an<00:02:25.910> object<00:02:26.330> with<00:02:26.480> real<00:02:26.720> physics<00:02:27.200> whether

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
into an object with real physics whether

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.949 
into an object with real physics whether
you<00:02:27.470> draw<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> ball<00:02:28.010> or<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.550> box<00:02:28.970> or<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> line<00:02:29.660> or

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
you draw a ball or a box or a line or

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.750 
you draw a ball or a box or a line or
some<00:02:30.140> sort<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.440> weird<00:02:30.650> indistinct<00:02:31.310> object

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
some sort of weird indistinct object

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.420 
some sort of weird indistinct object
game<00:02:32.060> recognizes<00:02:32.840> how<00:02:33.140> big<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.620> what<00:02:34.130> size

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
game recognizes how big it is what size

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.220 
game recognizes how big it is what size
it<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.330> starts<00:02:35.600> acting<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.080> real

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
it is and it starts acting with real

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.930 
it is and it starts acting with real
physics<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> object<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> get<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> ball

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
physics so the object is to get the ball

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
physics so the object is to get the ball
all<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.510> way<00:02:38.720> over<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.140> star<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.830> the

other end of the screen the puzzle start

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.840 
other end of the screen the puzzle start
out<00:02:42.140> as<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.440> see<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.280> puzzle<00:02:43.580> start<00:02:43.760> out

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
out as you can see the puzzle start out

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.910 
out as you can see the puzzle start out
very<00:02:43.880> simple<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:45.110> they<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.410> very<00:02:45.650> very

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
very simple but they get very very

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.650 
very simple but they get very very
complicated<00:02:46.550> as<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> game<00:02:46.910> goes<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.300> it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
complicated as the game goes on it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.750 
complicated as the game goes on it's
riveting<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.350> really<00:02:48.709> cool<00:02:48.890> hopefully<00:02:49.610> you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
riveting it's really cool hopefully you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.949 
riveting it's really cool hopefully you
guys<00:02:49.910> will<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.239> able<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.450> check<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> out

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
guys will be able to check it out

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.800 
guys will be able to check it out
sometime<00:02:51.170> soon

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
