experiment with your fighter when I see

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
experiment with your fighter when I see
a<00:00:55.890> new<00:00:56.070> players<00:00:56.340> decide<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.149> should

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a new players decide on what they should

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
use in battle it tends to be a spin will

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
use in battle it tends to be a spin will
attack<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.300> wise<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
attack so be wise to know that you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
attack so be wise to know that you
should<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.100> reliant<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.969> move<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
should not be reliant on one move and I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
should not be reliant on one move and I
explained<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.199> another<00:01:04.320> lesson<00:01:04.769> draw<00:01:05.640> your

example I can manipulate a fire to fit
my<00:01:14.549> place<00:01:14.790> zones<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.869> makes<00:01:16.110> me<00:01:16.290> less

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
my place zones so it makes me less

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
my place zones so it makes me less
