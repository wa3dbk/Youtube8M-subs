00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.750 
just learned a few minutes ago the seven
chords<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.880> C<00:02:18.180> major<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.860> let's<00:02:20.280> take<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> look

at<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> chords<00:02:21.330> first<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:23.299> figure<00:02:24.299> out

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
at the chords first so we can figure out

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.330 
at the chords first so we can figure out
because<00:02:25.140> there's<00:02:25.500> gonna<00:02:25.709> be<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> couple<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
because there's gonna be a couple of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.280 
because there's gonna be a couple of
wrinkles<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> doesn't<00:02:27.360> stay<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.019> C

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
wrinkles in here it doesn't stay in C

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
wrinkles in here it doesn't stay in C
major<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.769> whole<00:02:28.920> time<00:02:29.190> which<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.850> very

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
major the whole time which is very

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.479 
major the whole time which is very
typical<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.290> jazz<00:02:31.530> progression<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.340> not

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
typical of a jazz progression it's not

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.309 
typical of a jazz progression it's not
necessarily<00:02:33.299> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.540> stay<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.140> same

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
necessarily going to stay in the same

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.890 
necessarily going to stay in the same
teen<00:02:34.590> even<00:02:34.980> though<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.280> marked<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.730> way<00:02:35.900> at

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
teen even though it's marked that way at

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.080 
teen even though it's marked that way at
the<00:02:37.080> beginning<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> song<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.910> first

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the beginning of the song the first

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.120 
the beginning of the song the first
chord<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.660> song<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.140> actually<00:02:40.319> d<00:02:40.769> minor<00:02:41.010> 7

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
