00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.679 
among which when you looked at him
sideways<00:02:19.799> he<00:02:20.799> didn't<00:02:21.040> love<00:02:21.129> this<00:02:21.370> bulky<00:02:22.000> it

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
sideways he didn't love this bulky it

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.470 
sideways he didn't love this bulky it
was<00:02:22.840> pretty<00:02:23.079> thin<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.590> way<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.819> from

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
was pretty thin this way and that from

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660 
was pretty thin this way and that from
agile<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.870> your<00:02:26.019> armor<00:02:26.319> especially<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> quite

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
agile in your armor especially a quite

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.280 
agile in your armor especially a quite
early<00:02:27.970> model<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.390> mineral<00:02:28.689> Neary<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.959> thought

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
early model of mineral Neary I thought

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.679 
early model of mineral Neary I thought
that<00:02:30.069> didn't<00:02:30.280> really<00:02:30.400> make<00:02:30.609> any<00:02:30.670> sense<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.659> I

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
that didn't really make any sense so I

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.660 
that didn't really make any sense so I
decided<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.319> sliced<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.890> off<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.310> actually

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
decided I sliced it off and actually

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.130 
decided I sliced it off and actually
once<00:02:34.150> million<00:02:34.420> pet<00:02:34.510> steps<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.019> on<00:02:35.109> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
once million pet steps like that on a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.660 
once million pet steps like that on a
million<00:02:35.439> on<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> mini<00:02:35.859> figure<00:02:36.069> even<00:02:36.310> after<00:02:36.579> you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
million on a mini figure even after you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.759 
million on a mini figure even after you
painted<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.689> you're<00:02:37.959> kind<00:02:38.109> of<00:02:38.260> careful

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
painted it if you're kind of careful

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.720 
painted it if you're kind of careful
it's<00:02:39.340> pretty<00:02:39.819> easy<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.329> just<00:02:40.659> slice<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.769> off<00:02:41.890> so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
it's pretty easy to just slice it off so

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.699 
it's pretty easy to just slice it off so
if<00:02:43.000> you're<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.569> need<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.290> do<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.560> it's

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
if you're if you need to do that it's

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.789 
if you're if you need to do that it's
not<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:45.069> big<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.459> deal<00:02:46.230> well<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.409> a<00:02:47.440> big<00:02:47.560> of

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
not that big of a deal well is a big of

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.390 
not that big of a deal well is a big of
it<00:02:47.889> what<00:02:48.250> was<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.579> big<00:02:49.000> deal<00:02:49.239> was<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.950> was<00:02:51.099> flat

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
it what was a big deal was it was flat

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.759 
it what was a big deal was it was flat
on<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:51.940> when<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.389> was<00:02:52.510> on<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.780> minifigure<00:02:53.409> it

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
on here when it was on the minifigure it

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.460 
on here when it was on the minifigure it
was<00:02:53.920> completely<00:02:54.670> flat<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:55.870> now<00:02:56.019> but<00:02:56.319> when<00:02:56.440> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
was completely flat there now but when I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.140 
was completely flat there now but when I
put<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.889> standard<00:02:57.250> Knights<00:02:57.519> armor<00:02:58.060> it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
put it on the standard Knights armor it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.690 
put it on the standard Knights armor it
had<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.629> little<00:02:58.930> round<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:00.519> ended

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
had to be a little round so what ended

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.979 
had to be a little round so what ended
up<00:03:00.819> happening<00:03:00.879> was<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.420> crack<00:03:02.909> opened<00:03:03.909> up<00:03:04.120> you

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
up happening was a crack opened up you

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.080 
up happening was a crack opened up you
see<00:03:05.260> around<00:03:05.980> here<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.489> what<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.790> did<00:03:09.879> is<00:03:10.030> I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
see around here so what I did is I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.550 
see around here so what I did is I
filled<00:03:10.359> that<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:10.689> Millie<00:03:10.989> pie<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.439> then

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
filled that in with Millie pie and then

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.280 
filled that in with Millie pie and then
painted<00:03:11.859> over<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.129> it<00:03:12.340> looks<00:03:13.079> perfectly<00:03:14.079> fine

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
painted over it it looks perfectly fine

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.479 
painted over it it looks perfectly fine
now<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.400> um<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:16.510> looks<00:03:16.810> much<00:03:17.049> better<00:03:17.319> as<00:03:17.709> an

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
now but um it looks much better as an

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.640 
now but um it looks much better as an
armor<00:03:18.730> piece<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.389> just<00:03:19.599> looks<00:03:19.780> bulkier<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
armor piece like just looks bulkier and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.979 
armor piece like just looks bulkier and
I'm<00:03:20.949> really<00:03:21.579> I'm<00:03:21.879> much<00:03:22.389> happier<00:03:22.569> with<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> way

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
I'm really I'm much happier with the way

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.930 
I'm really I'm much happier with the way
that<00:03:23.199> turned<00:03:23.440> out<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.250> because<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.699> armor

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
that turned out but because of the armor

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.220 
that turned out but because of the armor
I<00:03:24.970> also<00:03:25.180> had<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:26.190> sand<00:03:27.190> down<00:03:27.659> these<00:03:28.659> shoulder

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
I also had to sand down these shoulder

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.369 
I also had to sand down these shoulder
pads<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.909> shoulder<00:03:31.299> pads<00:03:31.510> used<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.959> come<00:03:32.260> out

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
pads the shoulder pads used to come out

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.680 
pads the shoulder pads used to come out
a<00:03:32.409> little<00:03:32.530> bit<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.489> weren't<00:03:34.359> quite

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
a little bit more and just weren't quite

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.649 
a little bit more and just weren't quite
as<00:03:34.870> thin<00:03:35.199> and<00:03:35.409> pointy<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:37.180> after<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
as thin and pointy but after the

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.119 
as thin and pointy but after the
modifications<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.560> actually<00:03:38.829> turned<00:03:38.980> out

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
modifications it actually turned out

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.110 
modifications it actually turned out
much<00:03:40.000> better<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:42.040> paints<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.549> used<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:43.000> this

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
much better and paints I used for this

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.750 
much better and paints I used for this
our<00:03:43.389> citadel<00:03:43.870> paints<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.349> I<00:03:44.379> used<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.760> variety

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
our citadel paints and I used a variety

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.229 
our citadel paints and I used a variety
of<00:03:47.849> greens<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.329> yellows<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.970> used<00:03:51.970> white<00:03:52.209> a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
of greens and yellows and used white a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.659 
of greens and yellows and used white a
little<00:03:52.599> bit<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.319> think<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.069> used<00:03:54.099> a<00:03:54.310> purple

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
little bit and I think I used a purple

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.750 
little bit and I think I used a purple
at<00:03:54.760> one<00:03:54.879> point<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.889> was<00:03:56.949> a<00:03:57.069> color<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.609> was

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
at one point it was a color that I was

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.339 
at one point it was a color that I was
it<00:03:57.879> was<00:03:58.000> pretty<00:03:58.180> complicated<00:03:58.569> for<00:03:58.900> me<00:03:59.019> to

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
it was pretty complicated for me to

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.800 
it was pretty complicated for me to
figure<00:03:59.560> out<00:03:59.859> but<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:02.879> got<00:04:03.879> there<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.510> took<00:04:04.720> a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
figure out but I got there and it took a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.740 
figure out but I got there and it took a
little<00:04:04.930> bit<00:04:05.229> but<00:04:05.470> um<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:08.109> know<00:04:08.199> so<00:04:08.949> um<00:04:09.750> what

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
little bit but um you know so um what

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.059 
little bit but um you know so um what
I'm<00:04:10.840> going<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.139> do<00:04:11.319> I've<00:04:11.620> already<00:04:11.829> done<00:04:11.979> it

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
I'm going to do I've already done it

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.530 
I'm going to do I've already done it
with<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.250> right<00:04:12.280> hand<00:04:12.430> what<00:04:12.970> I'm<00:04:13.090> going<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.359> do

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
with the right hand what I'm going to do

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.360 
with the right hand what I'm going to do
is<00:04:13.690> I'm<00:04:13.810> going<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.049> slice<00:04:14.349> off<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:16.260> wrist

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
is I'm going to slice off the wrist

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.300 
is I'm going to slice off the wrist
detail<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.669> then<00:04:19.570> there<00:04:20.169> is<00:04:20.289> sculpt<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.070> then

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
detail and then there is sculpt and then

see some of the paintings wearing off of
the<00:04:34.970> hand<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:37.420> but<00:04:38.420> yes<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.720> took<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.930> little<00:04:39.110> bit

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190
