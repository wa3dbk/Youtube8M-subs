already done I'll take and find the top

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.940 
already done I'll take and find the top
of<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> sealed<00:01:11.100> beam<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.780> real<00:01:13.049> CT<00:01:13.409> 90<00:01:13.770> nut

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of this sealed beam I'm a real CT 90 nut

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
of this sealed beam I'm a real CT 90 nut
so<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.330> passion<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> can

so this is kind of my passion and I can

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
so this is kind of my passion and I can
save<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> few<00:01:16.560> bucks<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
save a few bucks this way so then I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
save a few bucks this way so then I
could<00:01:18.659> take<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.049> grinder<00:01:19.590> put<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.640> notches

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
could take my grinder put some notches

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
could take my grinder put some notches
in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.290> coincides<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
in there which coincides with the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.260 
in there which coincides with the
notches<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.670> socket<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.939> says<00:01:27.119> like

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
notches on this socket it says like

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
notches on this socket it says like
seven<00:01:27.570> eight<00:01:27.630> bucks<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.450> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
seven eight bucks for this take that you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
seven eight bucks for this take that you
just<00:01:30.630> offset<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> enough<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.340> turn

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
just offset it enough to when you turn

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
just offset it enough to when you turn
it<00:01:32.970> you're<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.250> light

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it you're now you're you know your light

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
it you're now you're you know your light
bulb<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> flat<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.380> high

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
bulb is flat so you can get your high

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.760 
bulb is flat so you can get your high
and<00:01:38.159> low<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> sit<00:01:38.759> properly<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.320> guess<00:01:40.560> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and low to sit properly and I guess if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
and low to sit properly and I guess if
you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.520> high<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> low<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> way

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you know if it's high and low that way

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
you know if it's high and low that way
or<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.549> filaments<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
or if the you know the filaments or the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.490 
or if the you know the filaments or the
other<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.079> flip<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> around

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
other way you just flip it around

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
other way you just flip it around
whichever<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.189> makes<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> happy<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.420> then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
whichever way makes you happy and then

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you pretty much have got a old light

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
you pretty much have got a old light
bulb<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.290> typically<00:01:52.799> well<00:01:53.700> here

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bulb that you would typically well here

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.100 
bulb that you would typically well here
of<00:01:54.030> course<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.450> throw<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> away<00:01:54.810> with

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of course you don't throw it away with

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.929 
of course you don't throw it away with
the<00:01:55.200> bezel<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> throw<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.430> away<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the bezel but you throw this away this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.179 
the bezel but you throw this away this
again<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.390> no<00:01:57.540> good<00:01:57.689> anymore<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> figured

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
again it's no good anymore but I figured

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
again it's no good anymore but I figured
hey<00:01:59.310> why<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.909> hog<00:02:00.329> out<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
hey why not just hog out the back of it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
hey why not just hog out the back of it
stick<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.899> light<00:02:03.899> bulb<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.920> can

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
stick in a light bulb in there you can

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.050 
stick in a light bulb in there you can
take<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.990> once<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> cut<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
take you know when you once you cut that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
take you know when you once you cut that
or<00:02:09.060> drill<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> pilot<00:02:09.390> hole<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.739> cut<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.099> out

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
or drill a pilot hole you cut that out

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.619 
or drill a pilot hole you cut that out
you<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.790> bulb<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> bigger

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you get then the bulb is bigger

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
you get then the bulb is bigger
typically<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.349> three

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
typically you can just three

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.339 
typically you can just three
get<00:02:13.769> up<00:02:13.890> inside<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.569> dump<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
get up inside and then dump out all the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.920 
get up inside and then dump out all the
parts<00:02:16.829> from<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> old<00:02:17.579> light<00:02:17.849> bulb<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
parts from the old light bulb like I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.539 
parts from the old light bulb like I
said<00:02:19.200> stick<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.739> there<00:02:19.950> boom<00:02:20.250> you've<00:02:20.489> got

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
said stick it on there boom you've got

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.559 
said stick it on there boom you've got
now<00:02:20.939> a<00:02:21.140> sealed<00:02:22.140> new<00:02:22.650> sealed<00:02:22.920> beam<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.579> took<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
now a sealed new sealed beam I took the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.390 
now a sealed new sealed beam I took the
old<00:02:24.720> rubber<00:02:25.049> off<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.349> back<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.010> old<00:02:26.159> one

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
old rubber off the back of the old one

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100 
old rubber off the back of the old one
and<00:02:26.430> kind<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.819> using<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.480> case<00:02:27.750> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and kind of using it in this case I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
and kind of using it in this case I
don't<00:02:28.799> know<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.879> know<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.629> know

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
don't know if this is you know you know

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140 
don't know if this is you know you know
DOT<00:02:31.079> approved<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:32.670> most<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:33.000> us

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
DOT approved but I think for most of us

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
DOT approved but I think for most of us
guys<00:02:33.329> we're<00:02:33.720> not<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.109> too<00:02:34.290> concerned<00:02:34.430> if

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
guys we're not really too concerned if

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.530

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you get pulled over and they're not
