00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello everyone and when you purchase 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.910
 A new phone is often faced with 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.680
 such a problem that the old phone 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
 worked on a regular sim card 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.960
 and the new phone is well supported either 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.990
 micro sim card or nano sim card and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.480
 so today we are at home 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.939
 actually manually try out the usual 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.439
 sim cards make micro sim cards so 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 what we need for this is actually 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:35.539
 Sim card itself double-sided tape here 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.340
 such a template that can be 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.760
 download the link below the video 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.460
 next night we will need scissors 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.550

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.670
 Concern to saw book SIM cards 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.100
 so she was smooth and so with the first 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.100
 the thing that we do is cut out the pattern 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.359

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.760

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.160

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.209
 We need to neatly trim on all matters 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.209
