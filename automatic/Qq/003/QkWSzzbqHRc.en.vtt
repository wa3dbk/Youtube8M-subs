mode<00:02:37.080> however<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:38.160> Sony's<00:02:38.550> you've<00:02:38.760> got<00:02:38.910> to

mode however with Sony's you've got to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.559 
mode however with Sony's you've got to
be<00:02:39.120> careful

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
be careful

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.630 
be careful
because<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> don't<00:02:40.409> pan<00:02:40.739> fast<00:02:41.129> enough<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
because if you don't pan fast enough it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.369 
because if you don't pan fast enough it
won't<00:02:41.819> record<00:02:42.299> all<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.840> image<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
won't record all of the image and

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.990 
won't record all of the image and
they'll<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.950> black<00:02:44.250> portion<00:02:44.819> at<00:02:44.939> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
they'll get this black portion at the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
they'll get this black portion at the
end<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.870> really<00:02:46.349> have<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> twirl<00:02:47.040> quickly

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
end so you really have to twirl quickly

end so you really have to twirl quickly
even<00:02:48.239> though<00:02:48.359> that's<00:02:48.540> gonna<00:02:48.659> make<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.989> dizzy

the<00:03:44.069> only<00:03:44.310> hang-ups<00:03:44.729> I<00:03:44.819> had<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> TX<00:03:45.599> 66

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the only hang-ups I had with the TX 66

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.020 
the only hang-ups I had with the TX 66
is<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.889> it's<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.220> little<00:03:47.519> bit<00:03:47.639> slow

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
is that it's a little bit slow

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.849 
is that it's a little bit slow
especially<00:03:48.629> when<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.900> power<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.349> camera<00:03:49.650> on

especially when you power the camera on

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.250 
especially when you power the camera on
and<00:03:50.099> sometimes<00:03:50.970> rifling<00:03:51.690> through<00:03:51.750> menu

and sometimes rifling through menu

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.500 
and sometimes rifling through menu
options<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:52.949> bit<00:03:53.129> slow<00:03:53.430> also<00:03:54.120> some<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.419> the
