00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
let's go straight to deck choices so

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.530 
let's go straight to deck choices so
pretty<00:04:19.950> much<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.370> only<00:04:20.400> deck<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.060> think<00:04:21.359> of

pretty much the only deck I can think of

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.080 
pretty much the only deck I can think of
that<00:04:21.780> evolves<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.040> malefic<00:04:23.400> red-eyes<00:04:23.940> black
