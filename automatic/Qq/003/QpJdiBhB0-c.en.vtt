00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.089
 aluminum heat sink and snorkel 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 for polaris tour 2012 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.189
 take-out radiator a850 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 and designed specifically for quad bikes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 polaris 550 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 850 turin x2 2009 2013 release 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.800
 serially except the company and there takeaway 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 radiators for these models in Russia 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.010
 nobody produces 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.440
 but about the snorkel know the models even 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.969
 say no and so takeaway 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.969
 radiator and snorkels 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.350
 on quad polaris touring main 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 the idea of â€‹â€‹our designers 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 make takeaways and snorkel reliable and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.239
 convenient for use in heavy 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.850
 conditions 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 as for the removal of the radiator, it is not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 the first model of removal from the company and there 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.170
 there are no features here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 designs distinguishing it from the set 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.239
 other 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 atomic carryouts but tell her 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 dignity still stands first 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.360
 aluminum construction is very light here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.610
 watch weight and and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.729
 1 point nine kilograms of it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 predecessor weighed 8 pounds in 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.009
 second reinforced bracket 4 mm 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.180
 the body itself is made of three 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.549
 millimeter aluminum 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 third you leans us back leaving 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.479
 room for maneuver and colleagues 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 fourth this takeaway is adapted for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.439
 installation on it systems snorkels 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.439
 recent developments of the company and there 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.130
 install radiator take-off on 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 available regular front case for the model 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.560
 polaris touring makes no sense how 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.750
 showed the practice of installing takeaways on 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.600
 model design of previous years 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.500
 it turns out not quite tough 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.210
 Scroper tightness is broken 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.399
 use it practically not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.500
 it seems possible and therefore you 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.270
 us and such a design were removed from 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.710
 production 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.869
 new you thoughts from the firm and there 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.470
 set on a plastic pad 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.270
 which is mounted instead of the standard Koba 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.160
 Features when installing takeaways no 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.709
 so we smoothly move on to more 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.709
 the interesting question of installing snorkels 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.160
 Snorkel at the birthplace of America but still 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.269
 quality product for polaris on 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.100
 home we did not find sewage that's what 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.590
 Americans offer the easiest 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.060
 cheap and not reliable version of snorkels 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.549
 we rejected right away 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.890
 but it turned out that options except 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.660
 sewage no more and we decided 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.060
 make your own design which 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.250
 our opinion turned out better safer 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.920
 and more convenient than the American judge you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 so let's start the essence of the construction is small 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
 aluminum panel 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.299
 which private 3 aluminum nipples 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.709
 63 pipe size 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.540
 welded sockets so that 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.239
 leave a space between the pipe and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.160
 panel for air intake on these 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.570
 nipples mounted on polyurethane 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.630
 pipe brand pro 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.210
 xav-63 and the whole structure is attached but 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.390
 radiator take-off installed 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.790
 I want to immediately warn you that the installation 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.040
 Such snorkels are not easy, so we 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.950
 recommend to contact professionals 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 although the craftsmen on the side too grab 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.850
 life gives nothing in our 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.500
 case too to place the cord or in 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.990
 central part of the radiator 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 I had to move the battery to 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.160
 I had to do for the engine 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.290
 translate coil during development 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 we still decided on such a construction 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.970
 with the transfer of a to b and coil because 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.010
 really wanted to hold hoses and 63 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.300
 millimeter and not 50 millimeters how 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.550
 Americans offer 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.230
 drank seedlings turned out carefully 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.140
 sealing the air filter housing 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.140
 in this place was a regular air intake 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.890
 we cut there the union under 63 hose 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.120
 transfer the coil and pass the hose under 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.210
 hood then bring it to the central 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.210
 part 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.100
 she is 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.050
 output variator output the same 63 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.830
 hose with fire protection measures 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.830
 security 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.930
 spend it along the engine and display 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.540
 under the hood the central part here 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.520
 variator through a special adapter 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.070
 output at the bottom of the viewer also under 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.680
 the hood and the central part of the central 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.870
 parts are waiting for us ready neat panel 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.790
 on which we fit our hoses 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.900
 fasten snorkels 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.900
 removal of radiators 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.950
 So 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.840
 Well 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.990
 I promise 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.990
 my
