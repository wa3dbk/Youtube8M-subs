in<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.760> lesson<00:00:03.000> we're<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.870> learn<00:00:04.290> how

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
in this lesson we're going to learn how

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.800 
in this lesson we're going to learn how
to<00:00:04.589> hook<00:00:04.980> up<00:00:05.160> our<00:00:05.339> animations<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.390> our<00:00:06.569> player

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
to hook up our animations to our player

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.220 
to hook up our animations to our player
input<00:00:11.150> all<00:00:12.150> right<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.599> let's<00:00:12.809> go<00:00:12.990> ahead<00:00:13.080> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
input all right so let's go ahead and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.550 
input all right so let's go ahead and
open<00:00:13.410> up<00:00:13.679> our<00:00:13.889> unit<00:00:14.549> editor<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.379> see

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
open up our unit editor and you can see

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
open up our unit editor and you can see
here<00:00:16.800> under<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> cat<00:00:17.850> food<00:00:18.090> folder<00:00:18.570> there's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
here under the cat food folder there's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.090 
here under the cat food folder there's
this<00:00:19.199> cat<00:00:19.470> Fuu<00:00:19.770> dot<00:00:20.240> flow<00:00:21.240> editor<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.650> double

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
this cat Fuu dot flow editor so double

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
this cat Fuu dot flow editor so double
click<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.970> will<00:00:24.090> bring<00:00:24.359> up

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
click on that and that will bring up

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.290 
click on that and that will bring up
your<00:00:25.109> unit<00:00:25.500> editor<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.010> well<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:27.210> will

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
your unit editor as well and it will

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.080 
your unit editor as well and it will
automatically<00:00:27.960> bring<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.380> flow<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:32.090> whenever

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
automatically bring up flow so whenever

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.410 
automatically bring up flow so whenever
we<00:00:33.480> press<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> Xbox<00:00:34.680> thumbstick<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:36.000> want<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
we press the Xbox thumbstick we want it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.569 
we press the Xbox thumbstick we want it
to<00:00:36.800> check<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.660> being<00:00:39.899> pressed

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
to check to see if it's being pressed

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
to check to see if it's being pressed
now<00:00:41.579> whenever<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.870> thumbstick<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> being

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
now whenever the thumbstick is being

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
now whenever the thumbstick is being
pressed<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.700> putting<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> value<00:00:45.960> between

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pressed it's putting out a value between

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.340 
pressed it's putting out a value between
zero<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
zero and one and so what I want to do is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
zero and one and so what I want to do is
I<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> check<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.489> value<00:00:50.760> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I want to check to see if that value is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.010 
I want to check to see if that value is
greater<00:00:51.629> than<00:00:51.750> let's<00:00:52.289> say<00:00:52.770> zero<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:54.420> it's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
greater than let's say zero if it's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
greater than let's say zero if it's
greater<00:00:55.320> than<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.610> into

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
greater than that I want it to go into

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
greater than that I want it to go into
the<00:00:57.120> run<00:00:57.329> state<00:00:57.690> okay

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the run state okay

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
the run state okay
so<00:01:00.109> let's<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.859> little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> logic<00:01:03.149> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
so let's use a little bit of logic in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.950 
so let's use a little bit of logic in
this<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> let's<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.689> length

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this so let's go over here to the length

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.460 
this so let's go over here to the length
and<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:09.000> click<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.630> I'm

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and I'm going to right click and I'm

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.539 
and I'm going to right click and I'm
going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> go<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> math<00:01:12.350> numeric<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
going to go to math numeric and I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.840 
going to go to math numeric and I'm
going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:15.000> greater<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.729> gonna

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to say greater than so I'm gonna

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.780 
going to say greater than so I'm gonna
plug<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.420> length<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:20.549> if

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
plug in my length right here and say if

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.230 
plug in my length right here and say if
this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.090> greater<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:23.150> tell<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this is greater than and then tell it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
this is greater than and then tell it
what<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.689> greater<00:01:24.930> than<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> say

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
what to be greater than I'm going to say

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
what to be greater than I'm going to say
point<00:01:25.979> zero<00:01:26.220> five<00:01:27.080> if<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.290> greater<00:01:28.619> than

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
point zero five if it's greater than

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
point zero five if it's greater than
that<00:01:29.630> then<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that then I want it to do this so I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
that then I want it to do this so I
wanted<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> check<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.920> true<00:01:35.369> or

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
wanted to check to see if that's true or

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810 
wanted to check to see if that's true or
if<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.150> false<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.400> I'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> right

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
if that's false so I'm going to right

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.010 
if that's false so I'm going to right
click<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> use<00:01:39.720> what's<00:01:39.960> called

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
click and I'm going to use what's called

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.999 
click and I'm going to use what's called
a<00:01:40.290> branch<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> under<00:01:42.420> flow<00:01:42.630> control

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
a branch and this is under flow control

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
a branch and this is under flow control
so<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.430> true<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.420> one

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so if it's true it's going to do one

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.039 
so if it's true it's going to do one
thing<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.320> false<00:01:46.590> it'll<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.100> another<00:01:48.049> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
thing if it's false it'll do another so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.830 
thing if it's false it'll do another so
let's<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.500> ahead<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:50.009> branch<00:01:50.600> let's<00:01:51.600> plug

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
let's go ahead and use branch let's plug

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
let's go ahead and use branch let's plug
in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> value<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.680> our<00:01:52.799> greater<00:01:53.070> than<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
in the value of our greater than to the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.300 
in the value of our greater than to the
condition<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> branch<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.860> whatever<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
condition of branch and so whatever that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
condition of branch and so whatever that
value<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:59.270> if<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.509> true<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> do

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
value is if it's true it's going to do

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.749 
value is if it's true it's going to do
something<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.040> false<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> do

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
something if it's false it's going to do

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.980 
something if it's false it's going to do
something<00:02:03.119> else<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.369> then<00:02:05.369> me<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.719> ahead<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
something else so then me go ahead and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.850 
something else so then me go ahead and
move<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> guy<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> way<00:02:07.920> here

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
move this guy out of the way here

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.830 
move this guy out of the way here
kind<00:02:09.490> of<00:02:09.550> want<00:02:09.730> to<00:02:09.820> reorder<00:02:10.150> some<00:02:10.480> things<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
kind of want to reorder some things a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.370 
kind of want to reorder some things a
little<00:02:10.930> bit<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:14.020> true<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.820> want<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.910> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
little bit so if it's true I want it to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.920 
little bit so if it's true I want it to
send<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.710> run<00:02:18.070> event<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> I'm<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
send that run event so I'm going to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.480 
send that run event so I'm going to
right-click<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.650> I'm<00:02:21.100> gonna<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
right-click and I'm gonna go to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.260 
right-click and I'm gonna go to
animation<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:23.410> I'm<00:02:23.530> gonna<00:02:23.680> say<00:02:24.270> send

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
animation and then I'm gonna say send

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.200 
animation and then I'm gonna say send
animation<00:02:25.870> controller<00:02:26.320> event<00:02:26.970> you'll<00:02:27.970> see

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
animation controller event you'll see

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.180 
animation controller event you'll see
that<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.570> looking<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.350> unit<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.980> this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that it's looking for the unit that this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.670 
that it's looking for the unit that this
node<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.080> unit<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.560> to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
node is on so then the unit is going to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.790 
node is on so then the unit is going to
be<00:02:32.740> our<00:02:33.100> cat<00:02:33.370> food<00:02:33.640> guy<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.350> we're<00:02:35.560> going<00:02:35.770> to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
be our cat food guy and we're going to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.210 
be our cat food guy and we're going to
run<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.310> event<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:37.180> we're<00:02:37.390> looking<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.810> run

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
run the event and we're looking for run

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.990 
run the event and we're looking for run
underscore<00:02:39.220> event

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
underscore event

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.630 
underscore event
it<00:02:40.570> must<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:41.050> spelled<00:02:41.350> exactly<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:42.400> this

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
it must be spelled exactly like this

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.680 
it must be spelled exactly like this
upper<00:02:43.090> case<00:02:43.300> our<00:02:43.600> upper<00:02:44.320> case<00:02:44.500> E<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.690> then

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
upper case our upper case E and then

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.810 
upper case our upper case E and then
we're<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.990> say<00:02:47.170> if<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:47.560> true<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.610> do

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
we're going to say if it's true then do

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.480 
we're going to say if it's true then do
this<00:02:49.030> if<00:02:49.330> it's<00:02:50.140> false<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.860> want<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.220> go<00:02:51.340> back

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
this if it's false we want it to go back

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.450 
this if it's false we want it to go back
to<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> idle<00:02:52.210> event<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.980> I'm<00:02:54.160> going<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.340> hit

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
to the idle event so I'm going to hit

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.770 
to the idle event so I'm going to hit
ctrl-c<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.090> ctrl-v

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
ctrl-c and ctrl-v

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.160 
ctrl-c and ctrl-v
to<00:02:56.320> copy<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.920> paste<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.490> node<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.540> then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to copy and paste that node and then

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.650 
to copy and paste that node and then
I'll<00:02:59.290> simply<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.890> change<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.520> from<00:03:00.760> run<00:03:01.090> to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
I'll simply just change it from run to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.520 
I'll simply just change it from run to
idle<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.510> we're<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:04.990> from<00:03:05.200> false

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
idle then we're going to go from false

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.820 
idle then we're going to go from false
to<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> end<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:08.470> should<00:03:08.680> be

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
to the end of that and that should be

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.920 
to the end of that and that should be
everything<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.460> need<00:03:09.700> now<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:10.480> need<00:03:10.810> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
everything that we need now we need to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.050 
everything that we need now we need to
check<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.200> see<00:03:11.350> if<00:03:11.740> this<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.040> true<00:03:12.250> or<00:03:12.760> false

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
check to see if this is true or false

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.500 
check to see if this is true or false
every<00:03:13.780> single<00:03:14.170> frame<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:15.490> what<00:03:16.060> we'll<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.360> is

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
every single frame so what we'll do is

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.830 
every single frame so what we'll do is
we'll<00:03:16.660> use<00:03:16.959> what's<00:03:17.230> called<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.740> level<00:03:18.130> update

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
we'll use what's called a level update

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.990 
we'll use what's called a level update
event<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.260> let's<00:03:20.290> right-click<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.640> let's<00:03:21.880> go

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
event so let's right-click and let's go

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.390 
event so let's right-click and let's go
to<00:03:22.060> event<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.810> here<00:03:23.709> you'll<00:03:23.860> see<00:03:24.040> level

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
to event and here you'll see level

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.140 
to event and here you'll see level
update<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:26.080> will<00:03:26.350> check<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.670> see<00:03:27.880> if

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
update this will check to see if

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.690 
update this will check to see if
something<00:03:28.660> or<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.650> will<00:03:29.830> execute<00:03:30.250> something

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
something or it will execute something

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.730 
something or it will execute something
every<00:03:31.300> single<00:03:31.630> frame<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> game<00:03:32.560> is

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
every single frame that the game is

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.420 
every single frame that the game is
running<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:35.350> there<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.680> go<00:03:35.709> we've<00:03:36.160> got<00:03:36.190> our

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
running so there we go we've got our

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.199 
running so there we go we've got our
level<00:03:36.730> update<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.330> that's<00:03:37.780> all<00:03:38.110> set<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.910> now

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
level update and that's all set so now

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.020 
level update and that's all set so now
if<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:41.200> go<00:03:41.230> ahead<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.740> hit<00:03:41.920> ctrl<00:03:42.310> s<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.910> save

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
if I go ahead and hit ctrl s to save

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.570 
if I go ahead and hit ctrl s to save
that<00:03:44.490> let's<00:03:45.490> go<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.209> give<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.660> test<00:03:47.580> so

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
that let's go in and give it a test so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.500 
that let's go in and give it a test so
if<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.730> hit<00:03:48.850> play<00:03:50.610> you'll<00:03:51.610> now<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.090> as<00:03:52.360> I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
if I hit play you'll now see that as I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.510 
if I hit play you'll now see that as I
start<00:03:52.750> running<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.170> character<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.040> cat<00:03:54.250> is

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
start running the character the cat is

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.510 
start running the character the cat is
running<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:55.780> direction<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:57.160> he<00:03:57.250> starts

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
running in one direction and he starts

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.920 
running in one direction and he starts
running<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:57.850> any<00:03:58.000> other<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.450> he's<00:03:58.660> going<00:03:58.840> back

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
running in any other and he's going back

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.120 
running in any other and he's going back
to<00:03:59.080> his<00:03:59.230> idle

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.820 

perfect<00:04:03.540> alright<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:04.960> that<00:04:04.990> we<00:04:05.170> have<00:04:05.560> that

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
perfect alright so now that we have that

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.090 
perfect alright so now that we have that
all<00:04:05.890> set<00:04:06.130> up<00:04:06.720> let's<00:04:07.720> go<00:04:07.900> ahead<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.500> get<00:04:08.830> our

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
all set up let's go ahead and get our

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.720 
all set up let's go ahead and get our
camera<00:04:09.780> because<00:04:10.780> right<00:04:10.990> now<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:11.170> are<00:04:11.730> getting

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
camera because right now we are getting

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.930 
camera because right now we are getting
our<00:04:12.850> camera<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.250> viewport<00:04:15.640> camera

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
our camera and it's the viewport camera

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.220 
our camera and it's the viewport camera
and<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.090> don't<00:04:16.150> really<00:04:16.600> want<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.810> use<00:04:16.870> that

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
and I don't really want to use that

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.250 
and I don't really want to use that
