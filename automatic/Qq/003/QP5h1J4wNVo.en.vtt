00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the boys today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.299
 make a quick contrast in the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.639
 kraft 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.700
 The first thing we would need is to do 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.740
 a wooden peak as I see it already 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 I have because I always put a chest of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.830
 help good first thing 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.100
 we would need it would be a made of wood 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 that is the only thing that is done successfully 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.590
 with 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.240
 3 wooden and 2 and 12 sticks first 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.240
 what we will do will be a cell 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.320
 for the 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.300
 14 callas always comes out that sr 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.260
 they do not explained like this 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.260
 we take it 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:03.230
 and we are going to look for some 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.230
 some stones that are in sight 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.159
 and if they have any mineral out there what 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.149
 we could find 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.149
 the callers 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:21.069
 to search 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.069
 we will see luck here there are heard English 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.280
 well now take three stone when 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.920
 they have stone now with that I get 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 create who again 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.520
 search for 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.159
 again or as in those two sticks 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.670
 of stone 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.670
 and that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.460
 only occupy the stone ones with these and the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.030
 hair is to make me the other one not the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.100
 ocu mena 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.780
 the other analog iron peak 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 this will be for me that diamonds 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.200
 well now that I have these three 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 first we would have been with eight of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.440
 these 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.440
 we will make an oven 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.050
 I'm going to start something to end up here 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.050
 If I find something 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.670
 coal encounter 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.670
 I will take care 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.240
 I seem to spend this time fast 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.930
 they have to sing doing something that I 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.930
 I always do 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.330
 we do vaginas 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.780
 everything against the go 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.860
 what I have is high 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.400
 well with these three yes we have 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.050
 good under those of those coals 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.150
 there may be a river of lava and there 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.620
 we continue there diamonds because always 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 side of the lava and minerals 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.910
 now we put the carbon here the 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.550
 iron and now we wait 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.950
 I'm going to put the video away to see if it 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.860
 can 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.860
 Well now the iron ingots are ready 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.160
 now at the kraft table we will do 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.500
 everyone 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:22.109
 this is this we do not know this we do not enter 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.150
 that is already being done at night I'm going to 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.150
 close here because we men 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.310
 now yes we are going 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.450
 we are lucky this time 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.540
 well there are diamonds what needs to be done 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.910
 when one sees he was always walking 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.330
 for the little thing that there is always like a 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.330
 road 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.050
 there is always a path around here 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.590
 as long as the diamonds ring before 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.750
 break it 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.750
 always do this because what 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.550
 good 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.470
 mentally you do not have to break up with 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.150
 the 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.850
 with this the wooden beaks the peaks of 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.150
 stones that you break with an iron 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.630
 now just now they looked at one of 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.400
 they have to go outside again 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.400
 7 this video took a long time 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:46.720
 pause again 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:50.400
 when it's ready when it's ready 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.090
 how best nothing removes them 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.090
 and let's go 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.199
 good 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.199
 when we go 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.009
 and with this the iron spikes could 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.009
 break this 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.870
 we the diamonds 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.800
 well here ends the video goodbye
