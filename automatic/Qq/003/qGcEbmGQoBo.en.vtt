00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380 

I<00:00:04.040> just<00:00:05.040> finished<00:00:05.250> cleaning<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.940> rebuilding

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I just finished cleaning and rebuilding

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.540 
I just finished cleaning and rebuilding
the<00:00:06.660> injectors<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.680> eighty<00:00:07.859> D<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.429> I

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the injectors on my one eighty D and I

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.339 
the injectors on my one eighty D and I
thought<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.150> would<00:00:09.360> enjoy<00:00:09.570> seeing<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
thought you would enjoy seeing the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.620 
thought you would enjoy seeing the
results<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.670> they're<00:00:11.820> quite<00:00:12.059> dramatic

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
results actually they're quite dramatic

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.560 
results actually they're quite dramatic
as<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.639> scene<00:00:14.969> this

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
as you can see in this first scene this

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
as you can see in this first scene this
was<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> spray<00:00:16.410> pattern<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.100> discovered

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
was the spray pattern that I discovered

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.000 
was the spray pattern that I discovered
when<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.119> took<00:00:18.270> these<00:00:18.750> out<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> car<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.680> put

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
when I took these out of the car and put

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.099 
when I took these out of the car and put
them<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> test<00:00:20.609> bench<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> look<00:00:21.960> at

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
them on the test bench take a look at

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.960 
them on the test bench take a look at
how<00:00:22.260> they're<00:00:22.470> squirting<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.160> mean<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.730> all

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
how they're squirting I mean it's all

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
how they're squirting I mean it's all
over<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.390> place<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:25.019> no<00:00:25.350> fine<00:00:25.710> miss

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
over the place there's no fine miss

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.599 
over the place there's no fine miss
pattern

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
pattern

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509 
pattern
there's<00:00:26.939> no<00:00:27.210> spray<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.470> squirting<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
there's no spray it's just squirting you

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.089 
there's no spray it's just squirting you
can<00:00:29.640> imagine<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.449> engine<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.170> probably

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
can imagine how that engine is probably

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
can imagine how that engine is probably
using<00:00:32.640> more<00:00:33.059> fuel<00:00:33.360> than<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.630> needs<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
using more fuel than it needs to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.490 
using more fuel than it needs to
so<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.489> install<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> new<00:00:36.390> monarch<00:00:36.630> nozzles<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
so I install the new monarch nozzles and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.229 
so I install the new monarch nozzles and
you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.460> nice<00:00:38.730> these<00:00:39.000> look

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you can see look at how nice these look

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
you can see look at how nice these look
right<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.750> you've<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> brand<00:00:40.680> new<00:00:40.829> nozzle

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
right here you've got a brand new nozzle

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.479 
right here you've got a brand new nozzle
these<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.730> set<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> fire<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.840> 1600<00:00:43.649> psi<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
these are set to fire at 1600 psi and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
these are set to fire at 1600 psi and
I'm<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.719> excited<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.469> installing

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I'm really excited about installing

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
I'm really excited about installing
these<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> 180<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.270> seeing<00:00:49.020> how<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
these in the 180 and seeing how well it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
these in the 180 and seeing how well it
runs<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> show<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
runs I just have to show you the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
runs I just have to show you the
difference<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.890> took<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.030> these<00:00:54.360> rebuilt

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
difference I took in these rebuilt

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
difference I took in these rebuilt
injectors<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.379> mounted<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> my

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
injectors and mounted them up on my

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.290 
injectors and mounted them up on my
handy<00:00:57.329> pressure<00:00:58.320> tester<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> look

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
handy pressure tester and take a look

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
handy pressure tester and take a look
here<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.989> believe<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> difference<00:01:01.649> look

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
here can you believe the difference look

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
here can you believe the difference look
at<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.340> spray<00:01:02.579> pattern<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.480> getting<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
at that spray pattern you're getting a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.100 
at that spray pattern you're getting a
nice<00:01:04.199> consistent<00:01:05.129> fan<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.820> well<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> mist

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
nice consistent fan as well as a mist

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.640 
nice consistent fan as well as a mist
and<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.510> I'd<00:01:09.510> absolutely<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and so I know I'd absolutely know that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
and so I know I'd absolutely know that
this<00:01:11.040> engine<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> run<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.299> better

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this engine is going to run much better

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.810 
this engine is going to run much better
produce<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:13.170> power<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> less<00:01:14.159> smoke<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
produce more power and less smoke I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
produce more power and less smoke I
shouldn't<00:01:15.659> mention<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.110> before<00:01:16.470> installing

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
shouldn't mention that before installing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
shouldn't mention that before installing

old injectors I thought hey the tips
didn't<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> bad<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.540> why<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> try

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
didn't look that bad so why not try

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700 
didn't look that bad so why not try
cleaning<00:01:37.680> them<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:39.170> retesting<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> sure

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
cleaning them and retesting and sure

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
cleaning them and retesting and sure
enough<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.189> did<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.520> retest<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> didn't<00:01:42.630> get

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
enough I did the retest and I didn't get

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.649 
enough I did the retest and I didn't get
any<00:01:43.079> better<00:01:43.409> spray<00:01:43.860> pattern<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.270> along<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
any better spray pattern but along the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.380 
any better spray pattern but along the
way<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.500> learned<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.130> new<00:01:47.159> trick<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.880> cleaning

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
way I learned a new trick on cleaning

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660 
way I learned a new trick on cleaning
these<00:01:48.659> old<00:01:48.899> injectors<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.159> original

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
these old injectors the original

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
these old injectors the original
objectors<00:01:51.119> were<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.990> gummed<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.680> it's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
objectors were really gummed up and it's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.940 
objectors were really gummed up and it's
really<00:01:53.220> hard<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.530> solvent<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.740> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
really hard to get a solvent that can

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
really hard to get a solvent that can
get<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> clean<00:01:57.329> all<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.570> old<00:01:58.049> goo

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
get in there and clean all that old goo

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 
get in there and clean all that old goo
out<00:01:58.530> especially<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.700> you've<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.210> injector

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
out especially if you've got an injector

they're<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.640> difficult<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.329> clean<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.439> what

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
they're very difficult to clean so what

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.580 
they're very difficult to clean so what
we<00:02:04.770> did<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.549> old<00:02:05.840> cooktop<00:02:06.840> got

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we did is we got an old cooktop got

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
we did is we got an old cooktop got
boiling<00:02:08.129> water<00:02:08.399> added<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.330> dishwashing
