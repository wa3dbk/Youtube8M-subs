it's<00:01:31.469> kind<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:31.710> safe<00:01:31.890> bet<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> assume<00:01:32.340> what's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's kind of safe bet to assume what's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's kind of safe bet to assume what's
gonna<00:01:32.880> happen<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.450> again<00:01:33.929> what<00:01:34.140> makes<00:01:34.289> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
gonna happen but again what makes it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.709 
gonna happen but again what makes it
good<00:01:34.679> is<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.219> comedic<00:01:35.670> ways<00:01:35.999> it<00:01:36.329> happens

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
good is in what comedic ways it happens

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.719 
good is in what comedic ways it happens
and<00:01:36.990> once<00:01:37.409> again<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.799> movie<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.399> shines

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and once again the movie really shines

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.209 
and once again the movie really shines
in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> comedy<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.749> animation<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.979> got

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
have to conform to say the Disney style

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.470 
have to conform to say the Disney style
or<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.350> Pixar<00:03:26.739> style<00:03:27.130> or<00:03:27.310> heck<00:03:27.670> even<00:03:27.970> sort<00:03:28.450> of

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
or the Pixar style or heck even sort of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.599 
or the Pixar style or heck even sort of
the<00:03:28.600> dreamwork<00:03:29.109> style<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.190> seems<00:03:30.430> to

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
the dreamwork style and it seems to

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.789 
the dreamwork style and it seems to
balance<00:03:30.760> out<00:03:31.150> really<00:03:31.450> really<00:03:31.570> well<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.590> you're

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
balance out really really well if you're

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.259 
balance out really really well if you're
not<00:03:32.920> fan<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.340> first<00:03:33.519> one<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.790> don't<00:03:33.940> think

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
not fan of the first one I don't think

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.000 
not fan of the first one I don't think
the<00:03:34.359> second<00:03:34.780> one<00:03:34.870> will<00:03:35.049> really<00:03:35.230> sway<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.709> at

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the second one will really sway you at

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.039 
the second one will really sway you at
all<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.640> if<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.150> like<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.420> first<00:03:37.690> one<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
all but if you do like the first one the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.479 
all but if you do like the first one the
second<00:03:38.410> one<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.620> more<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> same<00:03:39.220> great

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
second one is more of the same great

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.640 
second one is more of the same great
comedy<00:03:39.940> while<00:03:40.090> also<00:03:40.329> upping<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> new<00:03:41.109> so<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
