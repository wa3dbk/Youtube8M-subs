00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
pieces then the next step take this one

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.630 
pieces then the next step take this one
and<00:00:24.230> connect<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:27.240> way<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.640> so

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
it makes this and then on the other end

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.200 
it makes this and then on the other end
take<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.500> piece<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.660> put<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> soap
