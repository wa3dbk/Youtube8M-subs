00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
180 but now that I finally I feel like I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.320 
180 but now that I finally I feel like I
for<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.280> most<00:01:46.460> part<00:01:46.640> learned<00:01:46.940> how<00:01:47.150> to<00:01:47.210> play

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.780 
lot more than ghosts I'll say that at
least<00:01:54.080> now<00:01:54.350> there's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.010> bunch<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.370> problems<00:01:55.580> in

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
least now there's a bunch of problems in

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.220 
least now there's a bunch of problems in
the<00:01:55.910> game<00:01:56.090> I'm<00:01:56.240> gonna<00:01:56.390> go<00:01:56.630> over<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.960> my

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
the game I'm gonna go over that my

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.800 
the game I'm gonna go over that my
opinion<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:57.980> I<00:01:58.190> do<00:01:58.550> enjoy<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.360> game<00:01:59.540> more

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
opinion on but I do enjoy the game more

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.240 
opinion on but I do enjoy the game more
than<00:01:59.870> call<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.200> duty<00:02:00.470> ghosts<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.920> think<00:02:01.130> it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
than call of duty ghosts I think it's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.680 
than call of duty ghosts I think it's
more<00:02:01.280> fast-paced<00:02:01.730> I<00:02:02.120> think<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.480> color

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
more fast-paced I think the color

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.780 
more fast-paced I think the color
correction<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.350> game<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.830> better<00:02:04.040> keep<00:02:04.640> in

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
correction on the game is better keep in

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.340 
correction on the game is better keep in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
had it and basically what the game would

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.380 
had it and basically what the game would
do<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.320> will<00:02:53.410> match<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:55.030> people<00:02:55.300> that

I'm<00:03:02.440> not<00:03:02.560> gonna<00:03:02.680> go<00:03:02.860> too<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.310> depth<00:03:03.550> into<00:03:03.790> it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
I'm not gonna go too in depth into it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.330 
I'm not gonna go too in depth into it
but<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.660> game's<00:03:04.900> priority<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.800> match<00:03:06.100> you

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
but the game's priority is to match you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.979 
but the game's priority is to match you
against<00:03:06.730> people<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.360> equal<00:03:07.720> skill

level before connection or region which

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.810 
level before connection or region which
in<00:03:10.870> my<00:03:11.019> opinion<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.709> complete<00:03:12.250> fuckup<00:03:12.519> I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
in my opinion is the complete fuckup I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.220 
in my opinion is the complete fuckup I
think<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.330> really<00:03:13.720> stupid<00:03:13.959> idea

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
think that's a really stupid idea

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.830 
think that's a really stupid idea
especially<00:03:15.040> because<00:03:15.640> coal<00:03:15.940> duty<00:03:16.239> because<00:03:16.510> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
especially because coal duty because you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840 
especially because coal duty because you
died<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.380> quickly<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.980> especially<00:03:18.519> in

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
died so quickly and especially in

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.550 
died so quickly and especially in
advanced<00:03:19.090> warfare<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:20.019> die<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.230> like<00:03:20.350> three

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
advanced warfare you die in like three

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.320 
advanced warfare you die in like three
or<00:03:20.680> four<00:03:20.709> bullets<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.280> think<00:03:21.610> connection<00:03:21.910> needs

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
or four bullets I think connection needs

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.240 
or four bullets I think connection needs
to<00:03:22.450> take<00:03:22.660> priority<00:03:22.930> over<00:03:23.200> anything<00:03:23.799> at<00:03:24.220> least

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
to take priority over anything at least

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.789 
to take priority over anything at least
in<00:03:24.610> my<00:03:24.730> opinion<00:03:25.260> connection<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> huge<00:03:26.620> thing

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
in my opinion connection is a huge thing

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.920 
in my opinion connection is a huge thing
in<00:03:26.950> cod<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.489> putting<00:03:28.450> skill<00:03:28.750> based

matchmaking before the connection in my

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.150 
matchmaking before the connection in my
opinion<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> stupid<00:03:32.170> idea<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.829> I<00:03:32.950> want

exosuit a lot of people are having a
hard<00:04:47.530> time<00:04:47.740> getting<00:04:48.220> used<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.850> believe<00:04:49.840> it

hard time getting used to it believe it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.600 
hard time getting used to it believe it
or<00:04:50.020> not<00:04:50.110> me<00:04:50.530> having<00:04:50.980> played<00:04:51.220> titanfall

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
or not me having played titanfall

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.090 
or not me having played titanfall
definitely<00:04:52.270> helped<00:04:52.450> me<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.830> game

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
definitely helped me in this game

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.250 
definitely helped me in this game
because<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.760> titanfall<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.480> had<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.780> stick<00:04:56.080> to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
because in titanfall you had to stick to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.320 
because in titanfall you had to stick to
the<00:04:56.290> rooftops<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:57.040> dominate<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.639> as<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.120> see

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
the rooftops to dominate and as you see

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790 
the rooftops to dominate and as you see
in<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.570> majority<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.139> gameplay<00:04:59.380> I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
in the majority of this gameplay I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.770 
in the majority of this gameplay I
wouldn't<00:05:00.370> consider<00:05:00.730> camping<00:05:01.270> I'm<00:05:01.419> moving

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
wouldn't consider camping I'm moving

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.210 
wouldn't consider camping I'm moving
from<00:05:01.960> area<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.290> area<00:05:02.380> but<00:05:02.860> for<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.130> majority

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
from area to area but for the majority

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.370 
from area to area but for the majority
of<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.669> time<00:05:03.880> I'm<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.630> rooftops<00:05:05.140> and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
of the time I'm on the rooftops and

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.650 
of the time I'm on the rooftops and
that's<00:05:05.890> because<00:05:06.100> in<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.970> same<00:05:07.180> thing<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.480> real

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
that's because in the same thing in real

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.360 
that's because in the same thing in real
life<00:05:07.840> whoever<00:05:08.200> has<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.620> higher<00:05:08.800> ground<00:05:09.130> has<00:05:09.340> a

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
life whoever has the higher ground has a

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.860 
life whoever has the higher ground has a
better<00:05:09.640> chance<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.210> gunfight<00:05:10.450> and

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
better chance in a gunfight and

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.990 
better chance in a gunfight and
especially<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:12.010> same<00:05:12.220> goes<00:05:12.460> for<00:05:12.730> video<00:05:12.940> games

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
especially the same goes for video games

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.960 
especially the same goes for video games
so<00:05:13.540> that's<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.930> good<00:05:14.140> tip<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.860> usually<00:05:15.280> stand<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
so that's a good tip I usually stand the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.600 
so that's a good tip I usually stand the
rooftop<00:05:16.540> for<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.350> majority<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.190> time<00:05:18.400> you
