00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
one same thing pop out those two little

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590 
one same thing pop out those two little
prongs<00:00:55.680> lift<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.360> and

prongs lift it up just a little bit and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.209 
prongs lift it up just a little bit and
then<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> wiggle<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> comes

like<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> mentioned<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> supplies<00:01:09.270> video

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
like I mentioned in the supplies video

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
like I mentioned in the supplies video
and<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.979> obviously<00:01:11.430> 2<00:01:11.729> 8<00:01:11.970> gigabyte<00:01:12.479> cards

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and this is obviously 2 8 gigabyte cards

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
and this is obviously 2 8 gigabyte cards
so<00:01:13.380> first<00:01:13.650> off<00:01:13.830> we're<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.100> basically<00:01:14.670> do

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
so first off we're gonna basically do

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.280 
so first off we're gonna basically do
the<00:01:14.880> opposite<00:01:15.180> before<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> bottom<00:01:16.170> one

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the opposite before put the bottom one

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.980 
the opposite before put the bottom one
in<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.430> slowly<00:01:17.700> push<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
in just kind of slowly push it in it's a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.179 
in just kind of slowly push it in it's a
little<00:01:19.170> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> difficult<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:19.830> then

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
little kind of difficult at first then

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679 
little kind of difficult at first then
it<00:01:20.220> goes<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.729> easily<00:01:20.880> push<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> down

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it goes in pretty easily push it down

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.410 
it goes in pretty easily push it down
and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.560> prongs<00:01:22.770> pop<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.250> back<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.640> same

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and the prongs pop right back in same

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.330 
and the prongs pop right back in same
thing<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> second<00:01:25.320> card<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
thing for the second card just kind of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
thing for the second card just kind of
work<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> gotta<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.200> is

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.100 
the ir connector this connector is
probably<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> worst<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.690> them<00:02:51.930> so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
probably the worst of all of them so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380 
probably the worst of all of them so
just<00:02:52.650> kind<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.980> take<00:02:53.459> your<00:02:53.550> time<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
just kind of take your time with it and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.930 
just kind of take your time with it and
just<00:02:54.690> pry<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.590> will<00:02:55.680> pop<00:02:55.739> off<00:02:56.220> just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
just pry it it and it will pop off just

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640 
just pry it it and it will pop off just
make<00:02:57.090> sure<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.450> don't<00:02:57.690> break<00:02:58.050> any<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
make sure you don't break any of the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.530 
make sure you don't break any of the
connectors<00:02:59.159> within<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.120> or<00:03:00.239> anything<00:03:00.420> like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
connectors within it or anything like

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.199 
connectors within it or anything like
that<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.319> there<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.250> ir<00:03:02.580> connector<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
that so there is the ir connector and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.030 
that so there is the ir connector and
now<00:03:03.629> next<00:03:03.780> we<00:03:03.989> will<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.230> three<00:03:04.560> screws<00:03:04.830> we

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
now next we will have three screws we

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.440 
now next we will have three screws we
have<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.190> silver<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.790> at<00:03:05.909> the<00:03:06.000> bottom<00:03:06.120> that's<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
have a silver one at the bottom that's a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.420 
have a silver one at the bottom that's a
t8<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.989> we<00:03:07.110> do<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.409> two<00:03:07.590> black<00:03:07.890> screws<00:03:08.250> on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
t8 and we do have two black screws on

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.520 
t8 and we do have two black screws on
the<00:03:08.550> logic<00:03:08.730> board<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.239> those<00:03:09.599> are<00:03:09.750> t6<00:03:10.230> screws

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the logic board and those are t6 screws

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530 
the logic board and those are t6 screws
so<00:03:11.069> we<00:03:11.129> can<00:03:11.220> go<00:03:11.280> ahead<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.640> remove<00:03:11.819> all<00:03:12.269> three

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so we can go ahead and remove all three

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.710 
so we can go ahead and remove all three
screws<00:03:12.720> now

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.949

and now we can go ahead and install or
put<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.379> logic<00:03:28.799> board<00:03:29.040> removal<00:03:29.099> removal

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
put in the logic board removal removal

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.599 
put in the logic board removal removal

hard<00:04:08.430> drive<00:04:08.639> as<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:09.060> will<00:04:09.209> need<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.480> transplant

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
hard drive as we will need to transplant

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.610 
hard drive as we will need to transplant
that<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.340> our<00:04:11.549> SSD<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.230> know<00:04:13.349> just

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.989 

you

00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:35.999 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.419 

and<00:04:36.479> now<00:04:36.779> we<00:04:36.839> can<00:04:37.139> bring<00:04:37.289> in<00:04:37.529> the<00:04:37.679> SST<00:04:38.279> to

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:38.429 
and now we can bring in the SST to

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:40.699 
and now we can bring in the SST to
transplant<00:04:38.939> those<00:04:39.089> couple<00:04:39.449> of<00:04:39.479> parts<00:04:39.779> like<00:04:40.619> I

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:40.709 
transplant those couple of parts like I

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.309 
transplant those couple of parts like I
said<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.889> am<00:04:41.069> using<00:04:41.219> the<00:04:41.369> OCZ<00:04:41.729> vertex<00:04:42.269> for<00:04:42.479> 256

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
said I am using the OCZ vertex for 256

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.649 
said I am using the OCZ vertex for 256
gigabytes<00:04:43.799> and<00:04:44.039> then<00:04:44.549> we're<00:04:44.909> gonna<00:04:44.999> first<00:04:45.360> put

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
gigabytes and then we're gonna first put

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.059 
gigabytes and then we're gonna first put
in<00:04:45.809> the<00:04:45.959> screws<00:04:46.259> again<00:04:46.469> make<00:04:46.649> sure<00:04:46.679> it's<00:04:46.829> on

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
in the screws again make sure it's on

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.439 
in the screws again make sure it's on
the<00:04:47.189> correct<00:04:47.219> side<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:48.179> keep<00:04:48.360> your

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
the correct side so keep your

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.329 
the correct side so keep your
orientations<00:04:49.110> right<00:04:49.319> go<00:04:49.860> ahead<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.219> put

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:50.339 
orientations right go ahead and put

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.189 
orientations right go ahead and put
those<00:04:50.459> screws<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:50.969> and<00:04:51.149> then<00:04:51.749> tighten<00:04:52.049> them<00:04:52.110> in

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
those screws in and then tighten them in

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.259 
those screws in and then tighten them in
do<00:04:52.349> not<00:04:52.379> over<00:04:52.919> tighten<00:04:52.949> anything<00:04:53.669> in<00:04:54.059> this

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:54.269 
do not over tighten anything in this

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.539 
do not over tighten anything in this
build<00:04:54.539> as<00:04:54.779> you<00:04:55.319> probably<00:04:55.649> will<00:04:55.979> strip<00:04:56.279> out<00:04:56.369> the

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:56.549 
build as you probably will strip out the

00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:57.619 
build as you probably will strip out the
screws<00:04:56.759> just<00:04:56.789> make<00:04:57.179> sure<00:04:57.329> they're<00:04:57.449> nice<00:04:57.599> and

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629 
screws just make sure they're nice and

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.359 
screws just make sure they're nice and
snug<00:04:57.929> so<00:04:58.349> go<00:04:58.769> ahead<00:04:58.829> and<00:04:58.979> put<00:04:59.069> the<00:04:59.129> two<00:04:59.249> screws

00:04:59.359 --> 00:04:59.369 
snug so go ahead and put the two screws

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:01.759 
snug so go ahead and put the two screws
in<00:04:59.669> and<00:04:59.849> we<00:04:59.969> put<00:04:59.999> the<00:05:00.629> SATA<00:05:01.019> connector<00:05:01.379> onto

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:01.769 
in and we put the SATA connector onto

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.059 
in and we put the SATA connector onto
the<00:05:02.129> SSD<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.879> then<00:05:03.539> we<00:05:03.749> will<00:05:03.959> bring<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:04.799> Mac

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
the SSD and then we will bring the Mac

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.729 
the SSD and then we will bring the Mac
Mini<00:05:05.099> back<00:05:05.579> into<00:05:05.909> frame<00:05:06.179> now<00:05:06.899> the<00:05:07.319> last<00:05:07.529> little

business card getting the SSD or hard

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.799 
business card getting the SSD or hard
drive<00:05:13.919> back<00:05:14.159> in<00:05:14.459> is<00:05:14.729> a<00:05:15.059> little<00:05:15.269> tricky<00:05:15.659> as<00:05:15.749> you

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:15.809 
drive back in is a little tricky as you

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:17.569 
drive back in is a little tricky as you
can<00:05:15.929> see<00:05:16.019> there's<00:05:16.199> two<00:05:16.259> little<00:05:16.769> holes<00:05:17.099> now<00:05:17.519> the

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:17.579 
can see there's two little holes now the

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:20.389 
can see there's two little holes now the
screws<00:05:17.969> that<00:05:18.179> you<00:05:18.299> put<00:05:18.509> on<00:05:18.689> the<00:05:18.899> SSD<00:05:19.259> have<00:05:20.249> to

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:20.399 
screws that you put on the SSD have to

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.309 
screws that you put on the SSD have to
go<00:05:20.519> into<00:05:20.819> that<00:05:20.939> slot<00:05:21.269> it's<00:05:21.539> what<00:05:21.779> holds<00:05:21.989> the

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
go into that slot it's what holds the

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.529 
go into that slot it's what holds the
SSD<00:05:22.889> in<00:05:23.069> place<00:05:23.309> so<00:05:23.909> what<00:05:23.999> you<00:05:24.089> do<00:05:24.179> is<00:05:24.299> you<00:05:24.389> take

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
SSD in place so what you do is you take

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.499 
SSD in place so what you do is you take
you<00:05:24.989> know<00:05:25.019> a<00:05:25.439> rather<00:05:25.889> sturdy<00:05:26.309> card<00:05:26.819> and<00:05:27.119> you

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
you know a rather sturdy card and you

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.029 
you know a rather sturdy card and you
can<00:05:27.659> put<00:05:27.839> it<00:05:27.929> in<00:05:28.049> this<00:05:28.259> little<00:05:28.619> slot<00:05:28.799> in

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
can put it in this little slot in

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.499 
can put it in this little slot in
between<00:05:29.309> the<00:05:29.399> little<00:05:29.610> two<00:05:29.879> plastic<00:05:30.149> pieces

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
between the little two plastic pieces

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.269 
between the little two plastic pieces
I'll<00:05:30.779> show<00:05:30.929> you<00:05:31.019> in<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.169> second<00:05:31.589> if<00:05:32.009> you<00:05:32.099> can<00:05:32.189> get

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.459 
I'll show you in a second if you can get
a<00:05:32.309> card<00:05:32.639> in<00:05:32.879> between<00:05:33.269> there<00:05:33.509> just<00:05:34.079> like<00:05:34.199> so

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
a card in between there just like so

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.999 
a card in between there just like so
it's<00:05:35.039> gonna<00:05:35.189> allow<00:05:35.369> you<00:05:35.519> to<00:05:35.759> put<00:05:36.059> in<00:05:36.149> this<00:05:36.269> SSD

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
it's gonna allow you to put in this SSD

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.769 
it's gonna allow you to put in this SSD
pretty<00:05:38.009> simply<00:05:38.789> if<00:05:38.999> you<00:05:39.059> don't<00:05:39.389> do<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.569> this

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
pretty simply if you don't do it this

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.149 
pretty simply if you don't do it this
way<00:05:39.959> it's<00:05:40.169> going<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.349> take<00:05:40.529> you<00:05:40.679> probably<00:05:41.099> a

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
way it's going to take you probably a

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.429 
way it's going to take you probably a
little<00:05:41.279> while<00:05:41.489> to<00:05:41.639> get<00:05:41.789> that<00:05:41.999> to<00:05:42.779> sit<00:05:43.019> into<00:05:43.289> the

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 
little while to get that to sit into the

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:46.159 
little while to get that to sit into the
two<00:05:43.949> holes<00:05:44.189> properly<00:05:44.849> you<00:05:45.329> do<00:05:45.509> want<00:05:45.749> this<00:05:45.929> to

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
two holes properly you do want this to

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.109 
two holes properly you do want this to
be<00:05:46.499> in<00:05:46.739> you<00:05:47.159> know<00:05:47.189> a<00:05:47.279> hundred<00:05:47.579> percent<00:05:47.969> correct

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:48.119 
be in you know a hundred percent correct

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:50.179 
be in you know a hundred percent correct
like<00:05:48.839> I<00:05:48.869> said<00:05:49.169> if<00:05:49.319> you<00:05:49.409> mess<00:05:49.589> anything<00:05:49.829> up<00:05:50.039> you

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
like I said if you mess anything up you

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.219 
like I said if you mess anything up you
could<00:05:50.399> damage<00:05:50.639> your<00:05:50.939> Mac<00:05:51.089> Mini<00:05:51.329> so<00:05:51.959> as<00:05:52.079> you<00:05:52.139> can

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
could damage your Mac Mini so as you can

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.049 
could damage your Mac Mini so as you can
see<00:05:52.289> it<00:05:52.619> just<00:05:52.800> pops<00:05:53.009> right<00:05:53.249> into<00:05:53.489> those<00:05:53.759> two

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.059 
see it just pops right into those two

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:55.819 
see it just pops right into those two
little<00:05:54.239> slots<00:05:54.539> and<00:05:54.809> then<00:05:54.899> you<00:05:54.959> can<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.259> slide

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:55.829 
little slots and then you can just slide

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:57.259 
little slots and then you can just slide
the<00:05:56.009> card<00:05:56.219> out<00:05:56.369> it<00:05:56.550> will<00:05:56.759> make<00:05:57.029> a<00:05:57.209> huge

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:57.269 
the card out it will make a huge

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.049 
the card out it will make a huge
difference<00:05:58.169> for<00:05:58.379> you<00:05:59.369> know<00:05:59.459> how<00:05:59.610> easy<00:05:59.849> it<00:06:00.029> is

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:00.059 
difference for you know how easy it is

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.369 
difference for you know how easy it is
to<00:06:00.179> get<00:06:00.300> in<00:06:00.389> and<00:06:00.539> now<00:06:00.749> we're<00:06:00.959> basically<00:06:01.229> just

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
to get in and now we're basically just

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.159 
to get in and now we're basically just
gonna<00:06:01.769> do<00:06:02.339> the<00:06:02.489> entire<00:06:02.729> process<00:06:03.149> in<00:06:03.599> Reverse

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
gonna do the entire process in Reverse
