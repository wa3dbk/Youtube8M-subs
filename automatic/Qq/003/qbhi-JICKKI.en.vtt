00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's always really more carefully
building<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.319> anticipation<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:56.039> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
building the anticipation for the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.289 
building the anticipation for the
audience<00:01:56.459> at<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> beginning<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> film

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
audience at the beginning of the film

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
audience at the beginning of the film
before<00:01:57.569> they<00:01:57.659> seen<00:01:57.840> anything<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.799> fun<00:01:59.069> in

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
before they seen anything so much fun in

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.029 
before they seen anything so much fun in
Zombieland<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.810> challenge<00:02:01.319> was<00:02:01.560> really

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
Zombieland the challenge was really

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.669 
Zombieland the challenge was really
about<00:02:02.759> bridging<00:02:03.390> design<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.959> filmmaking

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
about bridging design and filmmaking

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.350 
about bridging design and filmmaking
I<00:02:04.709> was<00:02:04.950> attracted<00:02:05.340> by<00:02:05.369> ribbon<00:02:05.670> Fleischer<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
I was attracted by ribbon Fleischer and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
I was attracted by ribbon Fleischer and
he<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.840> taking<00:02:07.289> an<00:02:07.379> approach<00:02:07.679> that<00:02:07.709> we

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
he was taking an approach that we

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.819 
he was taking an approach that we
understood<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.209> terms<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.690> bringing<00:02:09.959> type

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
understood in terms of bringing type

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.819 
understood in terms of bringing type
into<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> film<00:02:12.269> in<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> row<00:02:12.720> integrated<00:02:13.650> away

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
into the film in a row integrated away

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.880 
into the film in a row integrated away
we<00:02:14.310> were<00:02:14.760> responsible<00:02:15.269> for<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.049> whole<00:02:16.349> intro

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
we were responsible for the whole intro

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.339 
we were responsible for the whole intro
so<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> whole<00:02:17.940> beginning<00:02:18.180> required<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.079> lot<00:02:19.230> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
so the whole beginning required a lot of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.970 
so the whole beginning required a lot of
design<00:02:20.250> thinking<00:02:20.970> eventually<00:02:21.980> everything

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
design thinking eventually everything

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.190 
design thinking eventually everything
collected<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.239> was<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
collected that this was going to be this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.890 
collected that this was going to be this
beautiful<00:02:25.590> slow<00:02:25.980> motion<00:02:26.370> shots<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.209> zombies

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
beautiful slow motion shots of zombies

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.620 
beautiful slow motion shots of zombies
all<00:02:28.590> around<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> country<00:02:29.400> killing<00:02:30.269> people

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
all around the country killing people

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.080 
all around the country killing people
and<00:02:30.840> then<00:02:31.170> integrating<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.799> type<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and then integrating the type in the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.569 
and then integrating the type in the
same<00:02:33.389> way<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.139> having<00:02:34.530> them<00:02:34.889> move<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
same way so having them move and that

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.180 
same way so having them move and that
beautiful<00:02:36.090> poletik<00:02:36.480> stopped<00:02:37.139> so<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
beautiful poletik stopped so you have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.250 
beautiful poletik stopped so you have
this<00:02:38.340> grace<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.389> at<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.630> same<00:02:39.900> time

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this grace to it and at the same time

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
this grace to it and at the same time
it's<00:02:40.950> horrific

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's horrific

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.820 
it's horrific
I<00:02:42.060> think<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> beginning<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.380> also

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I think from the beginning but also

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.270 
I think from the beginning but also
wanted<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.300> rules<00:02:45.570> be

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
wanted to have the rules be

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.260 
wanted to have the rules be
typographically<00:02:47.280> featured<00:02:47.640> within<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> film

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
typographically featured within the film

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.170 
typographically featured within the film
so<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.170> solution<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.860> was<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
so the solution for that was to have the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.330 
so the solution for that was to have the
time<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.600> interact<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.800> part<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
time to interact and be a part of the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.040 
time to interact and be a part of the
scene<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.150> has<00:02:54.330> become<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.660> character

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
scene and so this has become a character

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.680 
scene and so this has become a character
what<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.620> really<00:02:56.150> discovered<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.600> we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
what we really discovered is that we

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.420 
what we really discovered is that we
didn't<00:02:57.990> want<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> overpower<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.920> image<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
didn't want to overpower the image the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.970 
didn't want to overpower the image the
ninjas<00:02:59.760> were<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.120> fantastic<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.800> didn't

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
ninjas were so fantastic so we didn't

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
ninjas were so fantastic so we didn't
want<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.459> font<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.540> much<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.900> that

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
want to have the font do so much of that

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.750 
want to have the font do so much of that
work<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.440> say<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.770> hey<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.160> funny<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.670> got

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
work to say like hey I'm funny you got

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760 
work to say like hey I'm funny you got
plenty<00:03:05.910> fun<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.540> didn't<00:03:06.870> need<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.740> then

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
plenty fun it didn't need that and then

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.530 
plenty fun it didn't need that and then
need<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.340> sort<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.700> slapped<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.209> your<00:03:09.300> face

need to be sort of slapped in your face

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250 
need to be sort of slapped in your face
I<00:03:09.750> remember<00:03:10.320> seeing<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.280> theater<00:03:12.260> people

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
I remember seeing it theater people

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.810 
I remember seeing it theater people
laughing<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.340> tie<00:03:14.489> behaved

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
laughing at the way that the tie behaved

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120 
laughing at the way that the tie behaved
that<00:03:15.120> was<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> really<00:03:15.840> gratifying<00:03:16.500> moment

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
that was just a really gratifying moment

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.220 
that was just a really gratifying moment

out of focus more on photos and so

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.310 
out of focus more on photos and so
finally<00:04:03.209> they<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.660> took<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> lens<00:04:04.080> off<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
finally they just took the lens off the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.100

cap<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.190> real<00:04:05.450> booth<00:04:06.450> full<00:04:06.780> of

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
cap and so the real booth full of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.680 
cap and so the real booth full of
bouquets<00:04:07.860> dummy<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.030> camera<00:04:09.420> and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
bouquets dummy is just the camera and

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.229 
bouquets dummy is just the camera and
it's<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.200> looks<00:04:10.380> magnificent<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.549> edited<00:04:12.180> that

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
it's it looks magnificent I edited that

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.660 
it's it looks magnificent I edited that
by<00:04:12.720> itself<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.470> found<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.920> music

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
by itself I found the music

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.759 
by itself I found the music
and<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.300> did<00:04:15.540> something<00:04:15.990> that<00:04:16.019> was<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.230> rhythmic

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
and I did something that was a rhythmic

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.890 
and I did something that was a rhythmic
ode<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.640> film<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.359> was<00:04:18.480> purely

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
ode to the film but it was purely

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.390 
ode to the film but it was purely
rhythmic<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.680> had<00:04:19.829> one<00:04:19.980> of<00:04:20.070> our<00:04:20.160> test

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
rhythmic we had one of our test

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.240 
rhythmic we had one of our test
screenings<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.470> right<00:04:22.470> after<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.010> writer

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
screenings and right after the writer

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.000 
screenings and right after the writer
came<00:04:23.820> up<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.120> me<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.330> she<00:04:24.570> said<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.590> got<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.800> do

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
came up to me and she said you got to do

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.830 
came up to me and she said you got to do
something<00:04:26.460> with<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.640> end<00:04:26.820> that's<00:04:27.060> nostalgic

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
something with the end that's nostalgic

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.680 
something with the end that's nostalgic
I<00:04:28.110> mean<00:04:28.500> these<00:04:28.620> fantastic<00:04:29.310> stills<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.940> value

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
I mean these fantastic stills that value

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.860 
I mean these fantastic stills that value
or<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.050> our<00:04:31.800> set<00:04:32.070> photographer<00:04:32.660> on<00:04:33.660> Blue

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
or so our set photographer on Blue

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.420 
or so our set photographer on Blue
Valentine<00:04:34.050> took<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.010> was<00:04:35.130> funny<00:04:35.340> because

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
Valentine took and it was funny because

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.700 
Valentine took and it was funny because
as<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.330> was<00:04:36.450> watching<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.870> at<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.260> moment<00:04:37.470> I

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
as I was watching it at that moment I

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.409 
as I was watching it at that moment I
was<00:04:37.740> seeing<00:04:38.130> them<00:04:38.370> inside<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.970> fireworks

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
was seeing them inside the fireworks

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.909 
was seeing them inside the fireworks
right<00:04:39.660> after<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.320> we're<00:04:40.500> back<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
right after that we're back in the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.100 
right after that we're back in the
studio<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.580> put<00:04:41.910> something<00:04:42.240> together<00:04:42.480> those

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
studio and put something together those

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.930 
studio and put something together those
aren't<00:04:43.440> necessarily<00:04:43.580> stills<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.700> were

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
aren't necessarily stills that were

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.610 
aren't necessarily stills that were
taken<00:04:45.360> while<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.080> shooting<00:04:46.470> was<00:04:46.590> happening

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
taken while the shooting was happening

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.920 
taken while the shooting was happening
there's<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.520> connection<00:04:48.120> he<00:04:48.300> had<00:04:48.419> time<00:04:48.690> with

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
there's a connection he had time with

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.570 
there's a connection he had time with
them<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.230> they<00:04:49.350> collaborated<00:04:50.070> with<00:04:50.100> him<00:04:50.370> he

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
them and they collaborated with him he

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.320 
them and they collaborated with him he
really<00:04:51.030> got<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.510> actors<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.610> give<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.970> him<00:04:54.120> I

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
really got the actors to give to him I

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.730 
really got the actors to give to him I
think<00:04:54.600> that's<00:04:54.900> one<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.260> reasons<00:04:55.530> why<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
think that's one of the reasons why the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.630 
think that's one of the reasons why the
photos<00:04:56.250> are<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.640> resonant<00:04:57.390> and<00:04:57.750> powerful

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
photos are so resonant and powerful

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.210 
photos are so resonant and powerful
putting<00:04:59.640> images<00:05:00.000> inside<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.260> darkness<00:05:02.070> and

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
putting images inside of darkness and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.310 
putting images inside of darkness and
lightness<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.880> revealing<00:05:03.630> them<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:04.050> an

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
lightness and revealing them is an

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.260 
lightness and revealing them is an
experimental<00:05:05.160> technique<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.730> especially<00:05:06.060> to

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
experimental technique and especially to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.670 
experimental technique and especially to
put<00:05:06.450> something<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.870> in<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.200> mainstream

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
put something like that in a mainstream

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.070 
put something like that in a mainstream
cinema<00:05:07.950> was<00:05:08.520> really<00:05:09.270> exciting<00:05:09.660> for<00:05:09.690> me<00:05:09.870> at

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
cinema was really exciting for me at

cinema was really exciting for me at
those<00:05:10.290> moments<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.700> almost<00:05:12.060> ecstatic

those moments of the almost ecstatic
moments<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.169> filmmaking<00:05:13.560> are<00:05:13.830> really<00:05:14.340> magical

moments of filmmaking are really magical
that<00:05:15.690> moment<00:05:16.200> of<00:05:16.590> mystery<00:05:17.160> at<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.060> beginning

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
that moment of mystery at the beginning

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.460 
that moment of mystery at the beginning
of<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.480> film<00:05:18.660> that's<00:05:18.930> your<00:05:19.050> only<00:05:19.260> opportunity
