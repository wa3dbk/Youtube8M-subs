00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.110
 many in labor classes or just by 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.940
 fanu collected anything from paper 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.160
 for example, origami has become for some 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.280
 real art and meaning of life 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.800
 perhaps you for example how long 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.160
 did a paper airplane if it was 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.739
 He hands once the better of understanding and if 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.780
 recently then that's great here guys from 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.570
 media molecule is also quite likely 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.059
 such times when handicrafts brought 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.550
 not only positive ratings in 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.530
 diary but also some emotions 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.600
 some still stand powerful figure 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 maybe even from papier-mâché is not easy 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.980
 something collected in origami style and here 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.809
 again these guys from the media molecule 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.690
 who made a little big planet 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.019
 little big planet 2 and versions for kids 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.090
 psp decided to bring us back at this time and what 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.080
 out of this they showed us in 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 crappy game 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 Esenin 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.600
 if you have ever seen a trailer and or 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.960
 nothing about the game here for you 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 the secret is that she is bright cheerful and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 platform ie we do there 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.680
 all sorts of things usual for the genre 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.490
 we run we jump we collect we collect something 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
 someone helps someone hurts 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.440
 exterminating them cruelly and in general 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.480
 immorally 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.370
 but nevertheless everyone has their own purpose 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.320
 each their own tasks the question of why 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.600
 the game came out on by exhausted somewhere 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.450
 and did not come out on the same station 3 about everything 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 very easy to manage she is here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 exposed so that on the usual joystick u 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.470
 you would not have such cool opportunities 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.330
 for example, imagine the simplest 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.070
 Andrei, you're talking about such a screen with your finger 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.410
 and you simply set up 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.070
 take that finger to put it on zade 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.080
 Touchpad I'm a done deal, many say 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.120
 why the finger in the game is the same 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.850
 absolutely not necessary but the fact is that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.800
 the game understands that it has a player and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.990
 perceives you 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.140
 respectively, for example, the hero of the game 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.150
 they say that you as a player are the one 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.640
 lives in is this quote 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 and who besides you can save the poor and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.410
 hapless inhabitants of paper valley on 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.510
 this is all built for example you choose 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.940
 hero boy or girl and you already 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.430
 there is something which tasks in which most 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.730
 the player will need to help this hero 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.380
 for example, one of the first assignments will be 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 I would like to travel to the sun 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.269
 Of course on the moon but precisely on the sun and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.160
 guess who the sun is 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.019
 Of course you are all kinds of forest 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.530
 here are a lot of small player submissions 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.440
 we can hide such mini games 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.750
 some elements of the puzzle open 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.549
 gifts with two fingers and crouched like that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.459
 the spirit is very diverse it is all 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.100
 It turns out and I played the game literally in 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.470
 one run and I caught myself thinking that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.080
 it is time to stop for 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.900
 night of course after the game I want to 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.150
 there is something besides the impression here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.810
 here with it all right, you helped 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.290
 squirrels 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.480
 for example or moose or someone else 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.100
 and you already have 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.049
 opened so let's say storyboard that 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.970
 how can you collect this creature from 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.040
 paper is very cool a few of 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.080
 my friends have been doing this right before 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.340
 the release of the game and I also tried 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.130
 nothing happened and still I'm proud 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.410
 myself that I have not changed thanks 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.540
 a wide variety of techniques for 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.210
 passing it can be advised 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.190
 absolutely anyone can not compare 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.530
 little big planet load is obvious 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.170
 but if you choose between lbp 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.570
 air you I will choose the second this first 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.609
 this three-dimensional space can be here 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.950
 you can do a lot of fun things 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.660
 again, they will be shown to friends with 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.310
 a passion to look at how you play 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.070
 will ask for playstation vita themselves 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.440
 to do the same thing i'm sure 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.480
 if you have this game then it is you 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.310
 will not linger long in necessarily her 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.440
 one to his friend because he 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.800
 just can not resist and even more 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.520
 such games come out not so often therefore 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.450
 portable console 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.920
 she has almost no competitors and this 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.750
 probably the biggest plus for this 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.320
 the moment I do not know whether it will be possible to play not 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.840
 and in 10 years twenty years at least 5 but 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.750
 now it is really fun fun perky 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.550
 I absolutely advise everyone on this 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.160
 me actually all this was the days of 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.060
 fighting video block game and of course 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.060
 to new meetings
