00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you have always heard that your engine

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.350 
you have always heard that your engine
runs<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.410> gasoline<00:00:34.910> well<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.180> only

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
runs on gasoline well that's only

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
runs on gasoline well that's only
partially<00:00:36.840> true<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:38.100> engine<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.670> runs

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
partially true your engine actually runs

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.319 
partially true your engine actually runs
on<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> perfect<00:00:39.930> mixture<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.649> gasoline<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.670> air

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
on a perfect mixture of gasoline and air

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.470 
on a perfect mixture of gasoline and air
now<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.440> order<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> ratio<00:00:44.520> exactly

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
now in order to get that ratio exactly

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
now in order to get that ratio exactly
how<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.960> engine<00:00:46.289> wants<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.250> use

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
how your engine wants it you use

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
how your engine wants it you use
something<00:00:47.850> called<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> carburetor<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
something called the carburetor that is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
something called the carburetor that is
the<00:00:49.829> job<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.460> carburetor<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.480> create<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the job of the carburetor to create that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.000 
the job of the carburetor to create that
perfect<00:00:52.230> ratio<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.129> gas<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.120> air<00:00:54.329> mixture<00:00:55.260> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
perfect ratio of gas to air mixture now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.290 
perfect ratio of gas to air mixture now
let<00:00:56.129> me<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.340> ahead<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> show<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> guys<00:00:57.030> where

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
let me go ahead to show you guys where

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.639 
let me go ahead to show you guys where
everything<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.109> hooked<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.440> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
everything is going to be hooked up in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
everything is going to be hooked up in
hopefully<00:00:59.190> once<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.539> guys<00:01:00.660> will

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hopefully once I do that you guys will

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
hopefully once I do that you guys will
understand<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
understand a little bit more on how the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.920 
understand a little bit more on how the
carburetor<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.600> works

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
carburetor actually works

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.010 
carburetor actually works
so<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> course<00:01:05.070> before<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.780> mix

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so of course before this thing can mix

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
so of course before this thing can mix
it<00:01:07.170> perfectly<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.860> needs<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.790> those

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it perfectly it needs both of those

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
it perfectly it needs both of those
things<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.020> air<00:01:10.260> intake<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
things so your air intake is going to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
things so your air intake is going to
come<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> tube

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
come and it's going to go into a tube

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
come and it's going to go into a tube
that's<00:01:14.549> connected<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:15.960> where

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
that's connected right here that's where

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's connected right here that's where
that<00:01:16.229> big<00:01:16.290> air<00:01:16.860> hose<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.880> so

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that big air hose is going to go so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
that big air hose is going to go so
whenever<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.140> hook<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.409> our<00:01:19.590> air<00:01:20.009> unit

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
whenever we hook up our air unit

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.210 
whenever we hook up our air unit
remember<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> goes<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.770> now<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
remember it goes right here now for the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
remember it goes right here now for the
fuel<00:01:23.580> line<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> fuel

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
fuel line this is going to be the fuel

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
fuel line this is going to be the fuel
line<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> gas<00:01:26.729> tank<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.570> going

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
line in the gas tank is actually going

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.950 
line in the gas tank is actually going
to<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> hooked<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.759> right<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to be hooked up right here it's going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
to be hooked up right here it's going to
go<00:01:31.110> through<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.619> fuel<00:01:32.040> filter<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.670> cleans

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
go through this fuel filter which cleans

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
go through this fuel filter which cleans
any<00:01:33.390> crud<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.960> gas<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> go

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
any crud out of gas and it's going to go

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
any crud out of gas and it's going to go
into<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.850> carburetor<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.540> well<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
into your carburetor as well so now your

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
into your carburetor as well so now your
carburetor<00:01:38.549> has<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.119> perfect<00:01:39.390> balance<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
carburetor has that perfect balance of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.880 
carburetor has that perfect balance of
air<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.950> fuel<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> mix<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.439> I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
air and fuel and it can mix it and I'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.319 
air and fuel and it can mix it and I'm
not<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> show<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.460> guys<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> mixes

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
not going to show you guys how it mixes

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
not going to show you guys how it mixes
it<00:01:45.450> perfectly<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.229> remember<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it perfectly but just remember that this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
it perfectly but just remember that this
is<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.880> mixes<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.930> perfect

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
is what it does it mixes the perfect

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.030 
is what it does it mixes the perfect
ratio<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.009> air<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.030> gas<00:01:51.590> using<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> those

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
ratio of air to gas using some of those

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.069 
ratio of air to gas using some of those
pieces<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.450> don't

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
pieces in there you see that I don't

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.700 
pieces in there you see that I don't
even<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.530> that's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
even know if you guys can see and that's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.780 
even know if you guys can see and that's
one<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.689> mechanisms<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.200> actually

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
one of the mechanisms this one actually

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.980 
one of the mechanisms this one actually
controls<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> air<00:02:03.060> flow<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.719> see<00:02:03.869> but

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
controls the air flow as you can see but

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660 
controls the air flow as you can see but
anyways<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> said<00:02:05.100> I'll<00:02:05.219> talk<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.399> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
anyways like I said I'll talk about that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.609 
anyways like I said I'll talk about that
later<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.659> only<00:02:06.899> other<00:02:07.020> things<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> want<00:02:07.590> to

throttle cable and that throttle cable
is<00:02:24.750> hooked<00:02:24.990> up<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.470> gas<00:02:25.680> pedal<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
is hooked up to the gas pedal now the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.030 
is hooked up to the gas pedal now the
more<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.510> press<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.260> gas<00:02:28.470> pedal<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
more you press on your gas pedal the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
more you press on your gas pedal the
more<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:30.210> throttle<00:02:30.720> valve<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
more this throttle valve is going to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
more this throttle valve is going to
spin<00:02:31.830> now<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.820> throttle<00:02:33.330> valve<00:02:33.360> does

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
spin now what this throttle valve does

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.520 
spin now what this throttle valve does
is<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.440> allows<00:02:34.740> more<00:02:35.250> fuel<00:02:36.000> ever<00:02:36.720> mixture<00:02:37.320> into

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
is it allows more fuel ever mixture into

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.560 
is it allows more fuel ever mixture into
your<00:02:37.740> engine<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.550> how<00:02:38.700> does<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.300> it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
your engine so how does it do that it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.930 
your engine so how does it do that it
does<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.320> by<00:02:40.470> controlling<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.280> door<00:02:41.640> right

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
does that by controlling this door right

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.110 
does that by controlling this door right
here<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.290> all<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.160> air<00:02:44.370> &amp;<00:02:44.730> fuel<00:02:44.760> mixture
