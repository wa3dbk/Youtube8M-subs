 Hello to you I was the theme is one hundred and twenty 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.600
 second episode review igor app 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 for iphone ipod touch ipad 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 few cool games and programs so 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 let's talk about what the end will be yet 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 one game and so guys our first game 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 called modjo 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.890
 the game is a free webstar and here at the beginning 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 you can choose the field where we are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
 let's play it this one 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 cube our field is formed and in what 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.410
 the essence of the game is really great killed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 By the time in which we can 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 twist and zoom this cube and search 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.760
 similar figures like this 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.399
 means when we find all similar 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.410
 cubes then we will pass this level not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 we can go on to play accordingly 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 very interesting it just delays 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 because you want to pass it faster 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 field and go to the next one that is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 so play is fun to play 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.229
 Late very long game called maija 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 and it is free and 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 the next game is called jumping fox 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 and in this game we jump for the forest in general 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 the name fully justifies the gameplay 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.130
 and accordingly what is the essence of us 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 tap on the left we jump on the left then besides 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.720
 jump right this way if we are so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 him in the wrong direction then our forests will fly away 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.970
 inflicting we lose the meaning of the game as much as possible 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.220
 as fast as possible to get on here 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.020
 This tree is well and, accordingly, do not fall 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.759
 down in general lobules interesting as well 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 cool kill time is called a game 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.310

 The following genre of Russian sounds like 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 mountain goat semi game name can 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240
 see in the description of this video the essence 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.680
 this game is very simple we have a mountain 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 we are a goat here and we accordingly 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.000
 jump and should not fall into the water in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 some kind of cave general jump like 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.160
 can be higher on this mountain respectively 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 all just as we tap on the left we jump 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.060
 left then right jump right on 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.370
 levels there is a springboard and various 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
 coins so that our oil can be 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
 generally improve in general tin 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.630
 cool play cool g called 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.400
 mode was the next film game on 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.380
 which is definitely worth going along 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 they will do and now there are on your 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.880
 devices and you can play this game 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.590
 without what we see here with you 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.260
 super in which we move 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.420
 between various obstacles hiding 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.220
 we shoot absolutely everyone behind them 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.410
 who climbs on these levels 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 talking about this game can say one thing 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.910
 that you can play but sometimes it's very boring 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.650
 because all messi is pretty 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.690
 monotonous and in such games 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.340
 created to deflate by 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.460
 maximum money because there is 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.110
 in-game purchases generally want 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.570
 talk more about the movie than about this 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.210
 the game that is, we all go to the cinema soon 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.250
 new mission is impossible and impossible 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.530
 its a must see, especially about 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.500
 Tom Cruise did all the tricks himself without 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.970
 doublers in general should be a cool game 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 free called mission impossible 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.690
 more often it is called for from thieves miami in 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.910
 there will be another game at the end 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.350
 As for this game, then this is 10 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.880
 a game that is based on real 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.280
 events somewhere there is civil 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.080
 the war I did not exactly understand exactly where 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.450
 which country but now 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.340
 civil war goes on in almost any 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.770
 corner of the world it is very sad that 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.510
 As for this game, here we are 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.450
 must survive that is our main goal 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.790
 it survive throughout the game all 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.620
 starts at this house's location 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.780
 which we can absolutely play for 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.410
 you can choose any people below 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 card 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.820
 go different actions for that or 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.880
 another character again one goal 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590
 survive it collect various items 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.050
 avoiding various dangers helps 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.449
 friend 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.520
 overall the game is really worth it 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.349
 to play with her but also the price tag to 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.840
 horse snails 10 dollars to 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.879
 play this game well actually decide 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.099
 you play or not play my light to you 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:39.970
 play because the game is worth it 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.860
 definitely cool and last on 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.659
 Today the game is a new warhammer 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.270
 the game is notable because it is made 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.340
 on unreal engine 4 looks very 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.900
 cool as for the game owl itself 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.780
 gameplay then this is a turn-based strategy 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.120
 which we have to tactically 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.949
 think your steps and moo absolutely 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.770
 all monsters that appear on 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.569
 levels to protect your team as a whole 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.250
 pump our soldiers as far as 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.430
 There is a lot of pumping here 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.139
 pump and what to buy on themselves 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.300
 levels of which are very many here 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.490
 occurs the stock by such waves or 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.099
 in bursts then first we go then our 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.349
 rival then again we are and so 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.389
 we are the one who will win the one who will kill 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.759
 absolutely everyone and solve their problems that 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.620
 and win and move on all im 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.659
 It is worth playing , but the only thing is that the game 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.029
 paid but for warhammer lovers i 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.229

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.940
