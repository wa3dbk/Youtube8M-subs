00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Viktor Frankl speaks from three 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.580
 detection capabilities meaning they 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.920
 form a triangle of meaning the first is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.530
 what I give life through mine 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.680
 creative or creative 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.779
 activity 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 the second is what i get from life 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.359
 through my experience coming with knowledge 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.019
 world for example through music beauty 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 of nature 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 love 3 is the position I occupy 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.500
 in relation to life through my attitude 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.070
 personality attitudes that manifest themselves 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.129
 in situations of imminent suffering and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.260
 related to the inner position of a person 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.430
 able to preserve his virtues when 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 destructive blows of fate each 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 life situation represents 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 opportunity to embody at least 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.539
 one of these categories of values ​​and so 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.149
 to make sense 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.730
 was also found to be important 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 were aimed at intermediate goals and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.520
 achieving them is very important to fix 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 without devaluing them for the ultimate goal 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.860
 because intermediate goals are stages 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.259
 there is no big life 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.710
 shortcut to happiness happiness 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.060
 more important but more important to find a way to it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.369
 excessive need for happiness 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 the desire for it is a manifestation 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.680
 depending on the needs of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.590
 such an overwhelming urge 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.829
 fortunately a dependence on 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 it leads to it 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.520
 drug addiction 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.159
 alcohol games that is striving 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 short and easy way of feeling 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.070
 happiness 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.540
 feeling of happiness should come as 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.450
 consequence and not as a goal 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.729
 we throw a stone into the water and after that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 go circles on the water to see them 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.549
 you need to perform an action but you can 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.369
 without throwing stones see the waves get 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.219
 feeling of happiness as the ultimate goal without 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.520
 committing an action this is an option 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.049
 drug but there is subtlety 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.420
 subsequently there is a feeling of scarcity 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.190
 they are acquiring when happiness 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.800
 is a consequence of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.680
 powerful bonus phenomenon to any 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.350
 action at that moment when euphoria from 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 achievement passes the fact remains 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.120
 acquisitions that is perfect 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.010
 action remains i can forget the feeling 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.560
 happiness from winning the competition and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.200
 complain that now I will not achieve such 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.960
 results but can anyone take away 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 I have the very fact of this victory of that record 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.880
 even in the distant past, is this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.770
 victory went somewhere she stayed 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.410
 forever like the real fact of my 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.800
 the past in the case of narcotic 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.480
 dependencies the situation is different 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.260
 a person gets just like that 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.750
 euphoria 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.670
 but when she passes nothing remains 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:59.220
 and then there is a state of emptiness 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 wanting to fill it up and reappearing 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.600
 need for a new dose 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.910
 the search for meaning is the result 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.820
 spiritual human health in order 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.490
 to analyze your life and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.440
 try to find meaning in it take 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.980
 pen and paper and answer yourself 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.860
 the next question is what remains after 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.860
 me really valuable
