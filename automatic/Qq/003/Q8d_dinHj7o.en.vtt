00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 and the mechanical hands have changed to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 landscape in coffee plantations south of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.730
 mines 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.830
 gradually the conversation of the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.799
 catchers are replaced by the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 machinery noise 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 on this farm and three accounts of the 18 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 pickers hired for the harvest 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.970
 this year 12 work with them 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.199
 chairs 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 she can add and add 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 both for the worker and the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.359
 farm 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 according to the study of the embrapa 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.210
 Brazilian research company 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.629
 agriculture in some regions 90% of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.610
 already working with this technology 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.950
 this researcher ensures that the use of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 little hands as they are known sometimes 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 know how to save time and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 a worker with the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 ultimate parents tvit3 other 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.210
 workers leaving on hand economy 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.059
 with the producer who pays less 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.059
 harvesting is cheaper and advantageous 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.339
 for the lanyard the worker who wins 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.260
 more money to have an idea of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.010
 importance of davis on the brink of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.770
 crops 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 we are going to do a comparative look at the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.390
 victor who does not use any kind of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.619
 tool collects an average of ten measures 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.229
 coffee per day 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.270
 already the Cristóvão who uses little hand has 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.610
 a much higher productivity 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.430
 up to 30 measurements of the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 product is very complicated and it is one that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.579
 It makes me almost no mark on the hand 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.549
 put your hand more 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.229
 now it's just the little machine you want 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 buy a machine too if god 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 also want to offset the cooperation 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 difference is great and the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.439
 used only by men 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.720
 to 64 owner Carla in mind that 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 were it not the tool could not 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.579
 monitor the productivity of other 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 The female artist was also well off with the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 little hand gets better 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.149
 It looks much better in this specialized store. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.670
 in machinery for coffee-growing 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.360
 sale of real rose about 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.299
 50% in recent years around here is easy 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 find safrista looking for the product 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 the coolest goods trade is the car 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.560
 boss 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 it reaches 70% of all 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.150
 the sale of the store 's been five years that I 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.280
 I'm messing with the little machine they love. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.709
 Kaboul knows that even the good 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 faithful companion companion that we 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.760
 can not ignore
