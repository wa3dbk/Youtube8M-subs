00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.280 

it's<00:00:09.179> not<00:00:09.299> so<00:00:09.450> bad<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.780> time<00:00:09.840> because<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
it's not so bad this time because I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.949 
it's not so bad this time because I
don't<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.740> bring<00:00:10.889> across<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> water<00:00:11.959> but

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
don't have to bring across the water but

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.369 
don't have to bring across the water but
because<00:00:13.619> i'm<00:00:13.889> using<00:00:14.660> vulture<00:00:15.660> purified<00:00:16.200> water

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
because i'm using vulture purified water

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.130 
because i'm using vulture purified water
I<00:00:16.830> need<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.789> make<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.360> in<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.570> lab<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.050> then

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I need to make it in the lab and then

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.749 
I need to make it in the lab and then
bring<00:00:19.349> it<00:00:19.439> over<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.189> two<00:00:20.340> people<00:00:20.579> to

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
bring it over so we need two people to

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.240 
bring it over so we need two people to
carry<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.119> massive<00:00:21.509> but<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> water<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.250> every

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
carry a massive but the water over every

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.669 
carry a massive but the water over every
week<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:24.119> difficult<00:00:24.449> how<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.529> make

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
week that's difficult how do you make

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.210 
week that's difficult how do you make
ultra-pure<00:00:26.220> water<00:00:26.810> firstly<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.220> it's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
ultra-pure water firstly it's it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
ultra-pure water firstly it's it's
distilled<00:00:30.179> i'm<00:00:30.839> using<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.199> distillery<00:00:31.560> which

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
distilled i'm using a distillery which

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.560 
distilled i'm using a distillery which
essentially<00:00:32.099> takes<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> bigger<00:00:35.570> little

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
essentially takes out the bigger little

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.210 
essentially takes out the bigger little
impurities<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.379> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> water<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
impurities that are in the water and

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.190 
impurities that are in the water and
then<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:38.970> through<00:00:39.150> a<00:00:39.239> d<00:00:39.390> ionizer<00:00:39.809> which

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
then it's but through a d ionizer which

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.430 
then it's but through a d ionizer which
takes<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> ions<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.539> the<00:00:42.719> virtually

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
takes out the ions so it's the virtually

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
takes out the ions so it's the virtually
the<00:00:43.530> purest<00:00:43.920> water<00:00:44.039> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.489> come<00:00:44.700> across<00:00:44.870> why

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the purest water you can come across why

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.010 
the purest water you can come across why
such<00:00:46.230> pure<00:00:46.530> water<00:00:46.800> might<00:00:47.100> why<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.640> use<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
such pure water might why not just use a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
such pure water might why not just use a
water<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.350> tap<00:00:49.699> because<00:00:50.699> what<00:00:51.120> I'm

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
water out of the tap because what I'm

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.150 
water out of the tap because what I'm
doing<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.780> looking<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> fertility<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
doing is I'm looking at the fertility of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
doing is I'm looking at the fertility of
the<00:00:53.340> soils<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.600> water<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.230> drink<00:00:55.530> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the soils and the water that we drink in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.790 
the soils and the water that we drink in
our<00:00:55.770> houses<00:00:56.390> has<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.600> nutrients<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.170> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
our houses has some nutrients in it so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.490 
our houses has some nutrients in it so
we<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.519> make<00:00:59.550> sure<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.059> them<00:01:00.239> out

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
we got to make sure we take them out

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
we got to make sure we take them out
otherwise<00:01:01.500> i'll<00:01:01.769> be<00:01:01.829> adding<00:01:01.949> nutrients<00:01:02.519> into

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
otherwise i'll be adding nutrients into

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
otherwise i'll be adding nutrients into
the<00:01:03.030> soil<00:01:03.180> which<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.500> i<00:01:04.530> want<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> do

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the soil which is not what i want to do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.650 
the soil which is not what i want to do
they're<00:01:05.460> surprisingly<00:01:05.910> satisfying<00:01:06.119> when

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
they're surprisingly satisfying when

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.330 
they're surprisingly satisfying when
they're<00:01:06.810> growing<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.009> know<00:01:08.130> you're

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
they're growing and you know you're

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
they're growing and you know you're
keeping<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.759> alive<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.660> all<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> stuff<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
keeping them alive and all that stuff I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.450 
keeping them alive and all that stuff I
do<00:01:11.340> enjoy<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.880 

the<00:01:19.460> midget<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.960> might<00:01:21.140> recognize<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:21.740> from

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
the midget you might recognize this from

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.970 
the midget you might recognize this from
the<00:01:22.010> last<00:01:22.220> video<00:01:24.730> what<00:01:25.730> we're<00:01:25.850> looking<00:01:26.120> at<00:01:26.240> is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
the last video what we're looking at is

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.970 
the last video what we're looking at is
there<00:01:27.980> sand<00:01:28.370> in<00:01:28.790> there<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.300> in<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> sand<00:01:30.620> I've

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
there sand in there and in the sand I've

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.760 
there sand in there and in the sand I've
put<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.220> bag<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.820> very<00:01:32.630> fine<00:01:32.930> mesh<00:01:33.230> which<00:01:33.530> just

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
put a bag a very fine mesh which just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.930 
put a bag a very fine mesh which just
allows<00:01:33.890> water<00:01:34.250> through<00:01:34.550> doesn't<00:01:34.850> know

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
allows water through doesn't know

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.600 
allows water through doesn't know
anything<00:01:35.240> else<00:01:35.510> through<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.220> top<00:01:37.430> is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
anything else through and on the top is

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.990 
anything else through and on the top is
black<00:01:37.790> beads<00:01:38.120> that<00:01:38.300> stops<00:01:39.640> macias<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.820> things

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
black beads that stops macias and things

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.870 
black beads that stops macias and things
growing<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.510> sand<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.729> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
growing on the sand and in that is the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160 
growing on the sand and in that is the
soil<00:01:44.120> which<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.420> collected<00:01:44.780> across<00:01:44.990> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
soil which I collected across the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.940 
soil which I collected across the
country<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.060> are<00:01:47.450> two<00:01:47.870> tiny<00:01:48.710> little

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
country and in that are two tiny little

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.540 
country and in that are two tiny little
Heather<00:01:49.250> seedlings<00:01:50.380> it's<00:01:51.380> all<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.890> there<00:01:52.369> to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
Heather seedlings it's all in there to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.730 
Heather seedlings it's all in there to
make<00:01:52.640> sure<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.300> water<00:01:53.930> percolates

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
make sure that the water percolates

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.200 
make sure that the water percolates
through<00:01:54.830> nicely<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.520> evenly<00:01:55.580> throughout<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
through nicely and evenly throughout the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.969 
through nicely and evenly throughout the
soil<00:01:56.479> because<00:01:56.720> otherwise<00:01:56.930> if<00:01:57.259> if<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:57.950> just

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
soil because otherwise if if it was just

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.560 
soil because otherwise if if it was just
soil<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.430> there<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.670> might<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:59.000> pull<00:01:59.330> through

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
soil in there it might just pull through

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.550 
soil in there it might just pull through
and<00:01:59.780> end<00:02:00.020> up<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> bottom<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> tray<00:02:01.460> I

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
and end up in the bottom of the tray I

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.780 
and end up in the bottom of the tray I
took<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.619> long<00:02:03.830> time<00:02:03.860> doing<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
took a long time doing it I have to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.139 
took a long time doing it I have to
rotate<00:02:05.060> them<00:02:05.240> every<00:02:05.479> week<00:02:05.660> because<00:02:06.140> there's

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
rotate them every week because there's

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.969 
rotate them every week because there's
light<00:02:08.149> chance<00:02:08.540> that<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.500> difference

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.979 
light chance that there's the difference
in<00:02:10.100> temperature<00:02:10.610> only<00:02:11.209> by<00:02:11.330> maybe<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.810> quarter

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
of a degree across here there might be a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.930 
of a degree across here there might be a
little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.959> different<00:02:15.290> air<00:02:15.470> movement<00:02:15.940> the

little bit of different air movement the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.160 
little bit of different air movement the
lights<00:02:17.150> might<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.660> ever<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:17.930> slightly

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
lights might be ever so slightly

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.260 
lights might be ever so slightly
different<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.820> keep<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.030> all

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
different so just to keep it all

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.770 
different so just to keep it all

in<00:02:29.090> common<00:02:29.480> sherwood<00:02:30.350> forest<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:31.580> where<00:02:31.790> I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
in common sherwood forest it's where I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.990 
in common sherwood forest it's where I
collected<00:02:32.209> them<00:02:32.300> from<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.850> their<00:02:34.850> number

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
collected them from and their number

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.759 
collected them from and their number
because<00:02:35.540> I've<00:02:35.780> got<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.049> make<00:02:36.170> sure<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.590> all

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
because I've got to make sure that all

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.880 
because I've got to make sure that all
the<00:02:36.980> other<00:02:37.100> analysis<00:02:37.670> i<00:02:37.820> did<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> soil

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
the other analysis i did on the soil

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.920 
the other analysis i did on the soil
corresponds<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.130> which<00:02:40.610> soils<00:02:41.570> i'm<00:02:41.750> growing

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
corresponds to which soils i'm growing

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.900 
corresponds to which soils i'm growing
the<00:02:41.989> plants<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.700> something<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.760> really

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
the plants in something is really

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.870 
the plants in something is really
exciting<00:02:44.450> already<00:02:45.200> even<00:02:45.739> though<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.820> were

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
exciting already even though there were

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.470 
exciting already even though there were
only<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.090> month<00:02:47.239> into<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.750> project<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.799> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
only a month into the project is that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.090 
only a month into the project is that
here<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.930> one<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.260> see<00:02:51.380> here<00:02:51.709> which<00:02:51.920> is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
here this one you can see here which is

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.380 
here this one you can see here which is
symbol<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.549> more<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.900> i<00:02:54.610> know<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.030> fact<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
symbol be more is i know for a fact is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.690 
symbol be more is i know for a fact is
high<00:02:56.540> nitrogen<00:02:56.840> deposition<00:02:57.310> by<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.370> model

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
high nitrogen deposition by the model

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.330 
high nitrogen deposition by the model
that<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:58.880> used<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.709> see<00:03:00.860> how<00:03:01.040> big<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
that we used and you can see how big the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.320 
that we used and you can see how big the
henna<00:03:01.489> plant<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.940> there<00:03:02.440> compared<00:03:03.440> with<00:03:03.650> maybe

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
henna plant is there compared with maybe

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.850 
henna plant is there compared with maybe
this<00:03:05.330> one<00:03:05.570> which<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.320> lower<00:03:06.650> nitrogen

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
this one which is lower nitrogen

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.100 
this one which is lower nitrogen
deposition<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.420> still<00:03:08.660> barely<00:03:08.840> see

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
deposition and you can still barely see

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.430 
deposition and you can still barely see
the<00:03:09.230> Heather<00:03:09.380> plant<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.630> what<00:03:11.959> we're

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the Heather plant so this is what we're

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.070 
the Heather plant so this is what we're
trying<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.769> prove<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:14.180> see<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:14.750> quickly

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
trying to prove and to see it so quickly

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.890 
trying to prove and to see it so quickly
it's<00:03:15.950> my<00:03:16.100> exciting<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.600> exciting

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
it's my exciting that that is exciting

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.750 
it's my exciting that that is exciting
is<00:03:18.200> it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
is it

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.410 
is it
yeah<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:20.830> course<00:03:21.129> it<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.360> do

yeah of course it is this is what I do
this<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.870> what<00:03:23.079> I'm<00:03:23.170> looking<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.769> these

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
this is what I'm looking for these

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.369 
this is what I'm looking for these
little<00:03:24.909> things<00:03:24.939> is<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:25.720> expecting<00:03:26.200> something

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
little things is not expecting something

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.259 
little things is not expecting something
to<00:03:26.500> explode<00:03:27.159> or<00:03:27.519> blow<00:03:27.730> up<00:03:27.879> or<00:03:28.030> anything<00:03:28.090> like

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
to explode or blow up or anything like

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.130 
to explode or blow up or anything like
that<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.379> exciting<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.890> me<00:03:30.129> because<00:03:31.140> it's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
that this is exciting to me because it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.530 
that this is exciting to me because it's
showing<00:03:32.739> what<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:32.950> hoped<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.849> would<00:03:34.000> show<00:03:34.239> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
showing what I hoped it would show a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.750 
showing what I hoped it would show a
number<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.739> arguments<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.340> had<00:03:36.519> with<00:03:36.730> my

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
number of arguments I had with my

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.130 
number of arguments I had with my
advisor<00:03:37.150> about<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:38.110> thing<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:40.140> what

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
advisor about this thing because what

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.039 
advisor about this thing because what
wanted<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.799> use<00:03:41.980> was<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.519> little<00:03:42.819> push<00:03:43.030> one<00:03:43.299> you

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
wanted to use was a little push one you

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.770 
wanted to use was a little push one you
know<00:03:44.170> when<00:03:44.349> you've<00:03:44.470> got<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:45.150> keg<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.180> beer<00:03:46.420> and

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
know when you've got a keg of beer and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.630 
know when you've got a keg of beer and
you've<00:03:46.870> got<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.019> push<00:03:47.260> button<00:03:47.500> now<00:03:48.189> I<00:03:48.220> wanted<00:03:48.579> to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
you've got a push button now I wanted to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.580 
you've got a push button now I wanted to
use<00:03:48.730> one<00:03:48.879> of<00:03:48.909> those<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.390> tube<00:03:49.689> so<00:03:50.049> that<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.230> had

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
use one of those on a tube so that I had

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.240 
use one of those on a tube so that I had
more<00:03:51.569> control<00:03:52.569> but<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.590> course<00:03:53.650> doing<00:03:54.040> that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
more control but of course doing that

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.610 
more control but of course doing that
200<00:03:55.000> times<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.810> doesn't<00:03:56.019> do<00:03:56.260> much<00:03:56.379> of<00:03:56.440> your

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
200 times it doesn't do much of your

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.309 
200 times it doesn't do much of your
hand<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.340> plus<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:57.730> had<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:57.909> lean<00:03:58.150> over<00:03:58.319> which

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
hand and plus I had to lean over which

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.920 
hand and plus I had to lean over which
isn't<00:03:59.829> great<00:03:59.920> either<00:04:00.040> so<00:04:00.849> I<00:04:01.209> said<00:04:01.510> why<00:04:01.690> don't<00:04:01.750> I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
isn't great either so I said why don't I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.770 
isn't great either so I said why don't I
get<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.139> little<00:04:02.290> tube<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.340> can<00:04:03.519> use<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:03.909> I

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
get a little tube that I can use and I

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.110 
get a little tube that I can use and I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
got this and his face when I got it like

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.420 
got this and his face when I got it like
you<00:04:07.329> can't<00:04:07.599> use<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:08.290> too<00:04:08.470> big<00:04:08.709> you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
you can't use that it's too big you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.569 
you can't use that it's too big you
haven't<00:04:09.670> got<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.980> control<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.129> you<00:04:12.220> need<00:04:12.340> to

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
haven't got the control that you need to

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.809 
haven't got the control that you need to
but<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.030> think<00:04:13.930> if<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:14.230> watch<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.799> think<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.280> made

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
but I think if you watch I think I made

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.319 
but I think if you watch I think I made
the<00:04:15.849> right<00:04:15.940> decision<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.329> distilled

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
the right decision that is the distilled

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.569 
the right decision that is the distilled
water<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.840> deionized<00:04:20.320> water<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.799> fact<00:04:21.039> that's

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
water and deionized water in fact that's

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.250 
water and deionized water in fact that's
the<00:04:21.760> ultra<00:04:22.030> pure<00:04:22.180> water<00:04:22.449> that<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.900> bring<00:04:23.139> over

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
the ultra pure water that I bring over

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.790 
the ultra pure water that I bring over
every<00:04:24.010> week<00:04:24.460> or<00:04:24.639> so<00:04:25.169> it's<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.380> purest<00:04:26.530> water

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
every week or so it's the purest water

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.270 
every week or so it's the purest water
you<00:04:27.010> can<00:04:27.190> come<00:04:27.370> across<00:04:27.460> really<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.889> little

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
you can come across really so a little

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.129 
you can come across really so a little
bit<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.520> water

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.499

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
and it'll drop in the soil because

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.779 
and it'll drop in the soil because

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.860 

because<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:33.850> ultra<00:05:34.850> pure<00:05:35.060> water<00:05:35.360> I'm<00:05:35.690> not

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
because it is ultra pure water I'm not

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.290 
because it is ultra pure water I'm not
adding<00:05:36.230> nutrients<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.760> plant<00:05:38.000> will<00:05:38.150> take

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
adding nutrients so the plant will take

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.440 
adding nutrients so the plant will take
up<00:05:38.540> just<00:05:39.380> as<00:05:39.500> much<00:05:39.620> water<00:05:39.830> as<00:05:40.010> it<00:05:40.160> needs<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:41.330> as

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
up just as much water as it needs so as

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.020 
up just as much water as it needs so as
long<00:05:41.570> as<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.810> has<00:05:41.990> enough<00:05:42.350> water<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:43.400> should<00:05:43.640> be

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
long as it has enough water it should be

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.690 
long as it has enough water it should be
okay<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:45.410> would<00:05:45.920> be<00:05:46.010> slightly<00:05:46.250> worrying<00:05:46.490> if<00:05:46.640> i

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
okay it would be slightly worrying if i

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.780 
okay it would be slightly worrying if i
watered<00:05:47.030> one<00:05:47.180> far<00:05:47.510> more<00:05:47.690> than<00:05:47.750> another<00:05:48.110> and

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
watered one far more than another and

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.980 
watered one far more than another and
one<00:05:49.790> got<00:05:49.970> dry<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.690> wouldn't<00:05:50.930> be<00:05:50.990> good<00:05:52.990> these

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
one got dry that wouldn't be good these

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.620 
one got dry that wouldn't be good these
should<00:05:54.200> be<00:05:54.260> growing<00:05:54.500> for<00:05:54.770> about<00:05:54.920> six<00:05:55.220> months

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
should be growing for about six months

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.510 
should be growing for about six months
so<00:05:56.630> while<00:05:57.320> i'm<00:05:57.470> doing<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.890> field<00:05:58.100> work<00:05:58.280> over

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
see that back close that and then I have

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.220 
see that back close that and then I have
to<00:06:39.340> do<00:06:39.460> a<00:06:39.490> few<00:06:39.640> little<00:06:40.230> environmental

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
to do a few little environmental

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.100 
to do a few little environmental
readings<00:06:41.820> so<00:06:42.820> first<00:06:43.360> piece<00:06:43.630> of<00:06:43.660> equipment

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
readings so first piece of equipment

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.190 
readings so first piece of equipment
I've<00:06:44.200> got<00:06:44.410> is<00:06:45.400> this<00:06:46.200> which<00:06:47.200> is<00:06:47.410> a<00:06:47.650> light<00:06:47.860> meter

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
I've got is this which is a light meter

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.810 
I've got is this which is a light meter
some<00:06:50.200> around<00:06:50.530> there<00:06:50.680> got<00:06:51.640> about<00:06:52.500> 263<00:06:53.670> that's<00:06:54.670> a

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
some around there got about 263 that's a

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.260 
some around there got about 263 that's a
lot<00:06:54.970> this<00:06:55.870> connects<00:06:56.170> to<00:06:56.380> our<00:06:56.410> three

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
lot this connects to our three

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.300 
lot this connects to our three
thermometers<00:06:58.290> so<00:06:59.290> it's<00:06:59.440> logging<00:06:59.680> all<00:07:00.250> the

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
thermometers so it's logging all the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.820 
thermometers so it's logging all the
time<00:07:00.670> and<00:07:01.060> I<00:07:01.270> can<00:07:01.480> then<00:07:01.690> download<00:07:02.170> this<00:07:02.530> onto<00:07:02.740> a

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
time and I can then download this onto a

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.230 
time and I can then download this onto a
computer<00:07:02.950> and<00:07:03.370> see<00:07:03.520> how<00:07:03.700> the<00:07:03.760> temperature

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
computer and see how the temperature

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.390 
computer and see how the temperature
vary<00:07:04.450> this<00:07:05.200> believe<00:07:05.590> it<00:07:05.620> or<00:07:05.770> not<00:07:05.890> is<00:07:06.070> a<00:07:06.100> better

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
vary this believe it or not is a better

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.550 
vary this believe it or not is a better
than<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.560> electronic<00:07:08.560> equivalents<00:07:10.200> so<00:07:11.200> just

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
than the electronic equivalents so just

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.670 
than the electronic equivalents so just
wit<00:07:11.740> it<00:07:11.890> a<00:07:11.920> little<00:07:12.100> bit<00:07:12.310> and<00:07:14.940> fine<00:07:15.940> relax<00:07:16.900> all

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
wit it a little bit and fine relax all

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.940 
wit it a little bit and fine relax all
is<00:07:17.830> good<00:07:18.600> right<00:07:19.600> so<00:07:19.900> we<00:07:20.020> leave<00:07:20.170> this<00:07:20.380> for<00:07:20.920> a

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
is good right so we leave this for a

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.030 
is good right so we leave this for a
minute<00:07:21.310> or<00:07:21.550> so<00:07:21.760> just<00:07:21.940> to<00:07:22.030> draw<00:07:22.240> in<00:07:22.390> the<00:07:22.510> air<00:07:23.040> 16

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
minute or so just to draw in the air 16

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.520 
minute or so just to draw in the air 16
on<00:07:24.310> the<00:07:24.370> wet<00:07:25.240> wick<00:07:25.450> and<00:07:27.270> 19<00:07:28.270> on<00:07:28.450> the<00:07:28.540> dry<00:07:28.810> and<00:07:29.050> 19

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
on the wet wick and 19 on the dry and 19

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.500 
on the wet wick and 19 on the dry and 19
hmm<00:07:32.910> might<00:07:33.910> be<00:07:34.090> right<00:07:36.030> should<00:07:37.030> be<00:07:37.150> higher<00:07:37.360> than

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.510 
hmm might be right should be higher than

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.550 
hmm might be right should be higher than
that

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
that

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.230 
that
according<00:07:40.490> to<00:07:40.520> this<00:07:40.639> is<00:07:40.820> forty<00:07:41.060> five<00:07:41.210> percent

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 
according to this is forty five percent

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.210 
according to this is forty five percent
that's<00:07:41.930> quite<00:07:42.200> low<00:07:42.380> you<00:07:42.860> getting<00:07:43.070> have<00:07:43.160> you

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220 
that's quite low you getting have you

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.159 
that's quite low you getting have you
sleep<00:07:43.400> yeah<00:07:43.940> I<00:07:44.330> won't<00:07:44.660> lay<00:07:44.750> and<00:07:44.870> watch<00:07:44.900> this

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.169 
sleep yeah I won't lay and watch this

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:50.590 
sleep yeah I won't lay and watch this
video<00:07:46.660> yes<00:07:48.040> if<00:07:49.040> you<00:07:49.460> knew<00:07:49.850> but<00:07:49.880> if<00:07:50.090> I<00:07:50.180> goes<00:07:50.419> up

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:50.600 
video yes if you knew but if I goes up

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.200 
video yes if you knew but if I goes up
and<00:07:50.690> down<00:07:50.780> it<00:07:51.200> will<00:07:51.500> work<00:07:52.340> out<00:07:52.580> because<00:07:52.970> it's

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210 
and down it will work out because it's

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.700 
and down it will work out because it's
got<00:07:53.300> a<00:07:53.360> sensor<00:07:53.750> when<00:07:53.960> the<00:07:54.110> committee<00:07:54.320> has<00:07:54.470> gone

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:54.710 
got a sensor when the committee has gone

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.650 
got a sensor when the committee has gone
lower<00:07:54.919> and<00:07:55.070> it'll<00:07:55.970> turn<00:07:56.210> on<00:07:56.419> and<00:07:56.600> the

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:56.660 
lower and it'll turn on and the

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.390 
lower and it'll turn on and the
committee<00:07:56.840> will<00:07:57.440> suddenly<00:07:57.680> rise<00:07:58.010> because<00:07:58.220> it

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 
committee will suddenly rise because it

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.010 
committee will suddenly rise because it
pumps<00:07:58.669> out<00:07:58.790> steam<00:07:59.090> and<00:07:59.270> you<00:07:59.330> can<00:07:59.450> see<00:07:59.690> it<00:07:59.780> steam

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.020 
pumps out steam and you can see it steam

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.950 
pumps out steam and you can see it steam
out<00:08:00.850> but<00:08:01.850> the<00:08:01.940> moment<00:08:02.210> is<00:08:02.300> quite<00:08:02.510> low<00:08:02.660> that's

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 
out but the moment is quite low that's

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.650 
out but the moment is quite low that's
if<00:08:03.110> you<00:08:03.200> have<00:08:03.350> the<00:08:03.440> door<00:08:03.620> open
