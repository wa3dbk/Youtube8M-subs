00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
this black one because I just feel like

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.990

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
it hasn't had a fair chance

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.790 
it hasn't had a fair chance
oh<00:04:31.850> wait<00:04:32.850> close<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.300> go<00:04:33.420> in<00:04:33.540> 622<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.410> left<00:04:34.650> about

and they are hard ish so I'm just not
sure<00:04:47.160> I<00:04:47.370> mean<00:04:47.700> I'm<00:04:47.910> sure<00:04:48.180> if<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.780> hair<00:04:49.620> dried

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
sure I mean I'm sure if you hair dried

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.500 
sure I mean I'm sure if you hair dried
them<00:04:50.070> that's<00:04:50.580> what<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.790> said<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.090> do<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
them that's what it said to do and I

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.570 
them that's what it said to do and I
just<00:04:51.540> feel<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.590> clearly<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.490> to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
just feel like it so clearly you have to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.630 
just feel like it so clearly you have to
blow-dry<00:04:53.790> them<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.370> were<00:04:56.460> to

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
blow-dry them and if you were to

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.460 
blow-dry them and if you were to
hairspray<00:04:57.180> these<00:04:57.330> won't<00:04:57.510> brush<00:04:57.720> them<00:04:57.900> out<00:04:57.990> and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
hairspray these won't brush them out and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.110 
hairspray these won't brush them out and
then<00:04:58.770> hairspray<00:04:59.130> them<00:04:59.280> they<00:04:59.940> would<00:05:00.090> probably

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
then hairspray them they would probably

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.180 
then hairspray them they would probably
be<00:05:00.419> perfect<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.290> darker<00:05:01.620> colored<00:05:01.860> one<00:05:02.010> is

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
be perfect the darker colored one is

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.640 
be perfect the darker colored one is
pretty<00:05:02.460> much<00:05:02.610> like<00:05:02.900> purpley<00:05:03.900> magenta<00:05:04.470> and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
pretty much like purpley magenta and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.440 
pretty much like purpley magenta and
obviously<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.160> ball<00:05:05.310> one<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.640> totally<00:05:06.180> pink

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
obviously the ball one is totally pink

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.330 
obviously the ball one is totally pink
um<00:05:06.840> if<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.169> feel<00:05:07.320> like<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.530> needed<00:05:07.710> more<00:05:07.979> you

wanted to do a whole head there's enough
time<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:11.010> probably<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:12.240> do<00:05:13.010> happen<00:05:14.010> well<00:05:14.790> if

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
time there probably to do happen well if

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.550 
time there probably to do happen well if
you're<00:05:15.180> blonde<00:05:15.450> it'll<00:05:15.870> probably<00:05:16.110> do<00:05:16.410> your

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
you're blonde it'll probably do your

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.070 
I'd say I mean I can't actually go too
yeah<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:22.360> let's<00:05:22.660> still<00:05:22.870> look<00:05:22.990> like<00:05:25.080> focus

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080
