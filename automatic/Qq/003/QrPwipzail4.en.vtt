00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.350
 music is always annoying 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.450
 when I take off my earphones 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 no matter what reason or me 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 talk to someone or hope that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.860
 he found on the ground 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 my phone is already in the pocket but 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 there is dancing but throw it literally 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.859
 on the ground and then it comes there I had 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 you are a cyclist between him and 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.510
 chains and as know walk blast 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 smelling hear cronshaw okay what you do is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.619
 you have words know your phone does you 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 earphones in your phone and you put yourself 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 music in advance and that's what you do 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.229
 telephony you were fed up you want to go 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.390
 have a coat of your jacket on this work 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.990
 by the way only if you have a yo street 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.689
 and atmosphere jacket hat oh crap 3 a jacket that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.970
 not too long and what you do next is you 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.979
 takes your phone out of your pocket 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 and put it in your juice for when you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 earplugs then the remains tasty 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.170
 good hands and you can do it again easily 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.170
 back in the do I love it 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.560
 for all people who are great many 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 jar kept it but almost never can 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.390
 at purely because every kid at the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 what everyone just suddenly thought oh you 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.300
 my best friend is really mean 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.290
 and this is as nice as out but also so 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.909
 smart 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.190
 so I'm actually going to teach you something 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.800
 you do is you have a bullet tray full 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.470
 and the empty chewing gum and all you need 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.570
 having to do is us if the one is but 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.520
 ask for years of chewing gum because he saw you 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.740
 you may also just use the sofa as your back 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.509
 exactly the same bench that is empty and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.850
 then says yes I have nothing 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.380
 and if he insists extra you can 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.190
 just that bank and show that 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.780
 just nothing at all 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.690
 and also you can actually really enjoy yourself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.970
 already measured without there is five people 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.690
 Arrive and you run out of gum 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.590
 openness 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.019
 I think it's really a great tip 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.540
 actually pretty coleus I don't know 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.580
 how you take that for granted but will be there 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.220
 was only discovered a few months ago 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.290
 and applied they were, that's just them 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.810
 for youtube and some 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.640
 yes data usage and the app will save your data 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.590
 to put out what I like a lot 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.650
 i watch youtube with wifi and or what 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.130
 broadcast nice WiFi then there are networks 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 is on 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.840
 This is for the buddies that are on the one 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.700
 so own time that you 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.900
 for example, sit down in the evening 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.939
 or study 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 and eventually you come either vdab or you one 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.110
 Ready 12 hours and the year runs next 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.909
 very early in the morning but then you discover 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.040
 that your hair and your greasy fats 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.629
 no hope of shopping but so handy 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.310
 is that is over 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.230
 baby powder instead of roach oh god 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.780
 I hate for people who just 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.150
 darker hair like this or something or even on 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.680
 so do it the night before so if 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.450
 you can fully imagine that on the evening of the full 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.230
 you just really greasy hair but that you really 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.970
 have absolutely no time to wash 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.620
 then do the evening or kidnap and then 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.090
 for one day when you wake up 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.000
 then work on us a little bit 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.220
 good if you have very blond hair then yes 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.230
 you can also do it in mornings okay this one 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.760
 seems to me you can really go for different 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.889
 use things and you can know for yourself 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.989
 what natural energy port ' is just 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.849
 a glass 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.700
 i would kinda shine in this shape 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.200
 do and your phone and only you 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.230
 have to do is put your phone in it 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.810
 and smooth is so much harder for everyone 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.629
 shows missing in ecologies 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.690
 ok guys let this tip down 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.959
 knocked down shots so you can't do it 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.959
 look 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.030
 if you ca n't close a guide and that 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.760
 is so terribly all you need 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.530
 to do is something soft we play on and on 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.880
 I think you understand, and you 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.919
 no longer what I mean by that 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.810
 lip balm from sinen about something like that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.370
 like that when you put them on and on 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.260
 do a little back and forth to show this 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.260
 then it would be perfect 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.750
 I used this live when I was whole 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.320
 often well just busiest and that's you 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.169
 let nail polish dry faster with 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.669
 or with baking spray or olive oil 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.410
 it's just very simple 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.200
 all you have to do is your nails 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.800
 let varnishes dry for 15 seconds and with 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.810
 baking spray there hope friend speaker or that 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.850

 spray perfume and with it come hair and 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.139

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.630

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.150
 all youtubers 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.670

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:56.720
 you turned it on, it usually says 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:59.870
 under your user and finally make 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.300
 a playlist for the weather or so this was 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.889

 counterfeit just took terrible 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.789
 long and what I really want to say is 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.910
 that you have to make a playlist for 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.520
 the morning and that per activity one 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.590
 have some songs before it was like 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.210
 you start with in the bathroom teeth 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.979
 brush or something and you want ten 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.020
 minutes you can do 3 songs 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:23.240
 choose that, say, very slow pace 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.130
 and when you eat at the end 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.139
 and you want something ten minutes away 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.060
 just make sure you have a car 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.280
 have songs that are 10 minutes together 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.050
 and pretty soon they are once again 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.330
 you build from slow to fast 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.479
