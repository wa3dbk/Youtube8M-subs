 i click on 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740

 joining 15 will automatically detect it as a device 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.390
 plate employ 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390
 Otherwise, if we use a port 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.860
 different agüer looks 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.260
 such as a parallel port 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 we will have to add the printer manually 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 we give next 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.940
 the printer that we want to connect is directly connected to this equipment 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 hello called local printer 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.180
 we try and windows xp the detected 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.880
 automatically to the device if esplá campbell 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.549
 in the case of us we look for an epson printer lx3 cent 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.670
 connect to parallel port 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.880
 l pp one 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.680
 we'll see if windhoek ip automatically detects this device I love 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.050
 following 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 the assistant starts looking for a printer 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 new to be installed 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.099
 we assume you will not find it 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 because it is not connected to the foreign body 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.059
 however we can to watch it sent to mind 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 following 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.349
 Bravo 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.809
 we choose the port as it is connected 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.809
 the printer 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.089
 I see 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.760
 the expert or not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.289
 for the whole process 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
 the default port then next 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.489
 the elizondo printer 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.169
 model lx3 cent 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.509
 next lick 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.809
 we keep the existing driver burt windows xp recommends it 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.049
 the name the printer 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.059
 we select if you were in the default printer 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.049
 if not 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.049
 in other cases and that is more triple time predetermine 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.529
 it means that when we print something 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:23.809
 will be alak that by preference will choose windows for percent 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.039
 thrown an impressive 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.509
 this sale of the prompt if we want to share know them 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.289
 we are in the network 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.279
 in a network lan 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.409
 We can share the resource 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.809
 put a name otherwise 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.789
 next next 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.799
 two questions and we want to print a test page 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.819
 let's say it was flooded 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.889
 the next 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.079
 ends 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.599
 the first one on the test page wants to say to see if 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.419
 the windows 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.789
 to 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.009
 installed correctly 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.619
 another investment 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.879
 or drivers of this printer and how to work correctly 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.889
 ends 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.370
 then 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 yes he has printed correctly we give him more back 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.949
