as<00:01:24.420> many<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.259> kale<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> kales<00:01:27.030> mansion

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
as many as the kale the kales mansion

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
as many as the kale the kales mansion
basement<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:29.210> skeleton<00:01:30.210> trick<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
basement you know skeleton trick that I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
basement you know skeleton trick that I
had<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> channel<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> month<00:01:33.329> or

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
had up on the channel about a month or

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.300 
had up on the channel about a month or
so<00:01:33.630> ago<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.659> easier<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.799> pull

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so ago but this is much easier to pull

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
so ago but this is much easier to pull
off<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.790> general<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:39.930> enemies<00:01:40.200> are

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
off in general because these enemies are

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
off in general because these enemies are
very<00:01:40.470> easy<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.310> high<00:01:41.490> knee<00:01:41.729> games

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
very easy even on high knee games

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.859 
very easy even on high knee games
and<00:01:43.340> basically<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.820> bomb<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and basically you can just bomb this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
and basically you can just bomb this
area<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> human<00:01:46.920> effigy<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.549> very

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
area for the human effigy is very very

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.370 
area for the human effigy is very very
quickly

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
quickly

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
quickly

there's<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> much<00:02:36.630> simpler<00:02:36.989> way<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:38.160> I've

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
there's a much simpler way and that I've

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.380 
there's a much simpler way and that I've
learned<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:41.670> don't<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.269> how

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
learned as well so if you don't know how

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.670 
learned as well so if you don't know how
to<00:02:42.450> get<00:02:42.599> infinite<00:02:42.870> aesthetics<00:02:43.380> there's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to get infinite aesthetics there's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.620 
to get infinite aesthetics there's
probably<00:02:44.370> an<00:02:44.519> annotation<00:02:44.849> on<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> screen<00:02:45.209> now

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
probably an annotation on the screen now

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.039 
probably an annotation on the screen now
