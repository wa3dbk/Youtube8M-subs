00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the first set but Annie Murray cannot

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.690 
the first set but Annie Murray cannot
win<00:02:26.870> because<00:02:27.140> Rafa<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.710> too<00:02:28.070> good<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.460> not<00:02:28.550> for

get to know let's see if I can find

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:42.300 
get to know let's see if I can find
something<00:03:31.070> else<00:03:40.180> did<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.390> guys<00:03:41.600> know<00:03:41.959> that

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
there's a device that can actually

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.030 
there's a device that can actually
multiply<00:03:49.480> numbers<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:51.410> let's<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.800> say<00:03:51.950> I'm

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
multiply numbers so let's just say I'm

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.000 
multiply numbers so let's just say I'm
gonna<00:03:52.160> find<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:56.110> Jim<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.820> see<00:03:59.030> that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
gonna find like to it Jim you see that

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.460 
gonna find like to it Jim you see that
you<00:04:01.010> multiply<00:04:01.250> press<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.820> times<00:04:02.030> man<00:04:05.470> first

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
you multiply press the times man first

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.900 
you multiply press the times man first
to<00:04:06.560> again

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.729 

Wow<00:04:11.910> now<00:04:12.810> I'm<00:04:13.019> just<00:04:13.110> gonna<00:04:13.230> show<00:04:13.500> one<00:04:13.709> more

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
Wow now I'm just gonna show one more

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.020 
Wow now I'm just gonna show one more
things<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.340> think<00:04:14.489> this<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.670> too<00:04:14.819> much<00:04:14.910> for

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
things and I think this is too much for

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.770 
things and I think this is too much for
us<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.239> handle

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
us to handle

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.969 
us to handle
so<00:04:16.139> looks<00:04:17.010> like<00:04:17.160> let's<00:04:17.370> say<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.489> want<00:04:17.639> to<00:04:17.669> add
