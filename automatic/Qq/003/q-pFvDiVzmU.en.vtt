already my code minecraft server with an

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.470 
already my code minecraft server with an
IP<00:00:11.700> address<00:00:11.820> at<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.650> active<00:00:14.480> with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
IP address at that and it is active with

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.599 
IP address at that and it is active with
memory<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.230> gig<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.740> disk<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.310> 30

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
memory of one gig in a disk of 30

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.790 
memory of one gig in a disk of 30
gigabytes<00:00:17.940> SSD<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.050> good<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.710> we're

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
gigabytes SSD which is good so we're

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.750 
gigabytes SSD which is good so we're
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.130> ahead<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> log<00:00:20.520> into<00:00:20.670> our

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
going to go ahead and log into our

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.140 
going to go ahead and log into our
server<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.810> recently<00:00:22.439> created<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
server that we just recently created and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.130 
server that we just recently created and
log<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.130> that's<00:00:26.130> great<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.900> order<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
log in and that's great so in order to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.720 
log in and that's great so in order to
get<00:00:28.289> started<00:00:28.590> we're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
get started we're going to have to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
get started we're going to have to
install<00:00:30.480> Java<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:31.830> wearing

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
install Java if it's not wearing

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
install Java if it's not wearing
installed<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.640> check<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.180> installed

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
installed to check to see if installed

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
installed to check to see if installed
just<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.290> java<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.790> should<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.120> command

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
just do java and you should see command

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.639 
just do java and you should see command
not<00:00:36.870> found<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.100> we'll<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.790> do

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
not found so then we'll go and do

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.540 
not found so then we'll go and do
apt-get<00:00:40.649> install<00:00:41.960> default<00:00:43.129> jdk<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
apt-get install default jdk now this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.229 
apt-get install default jdk now this
will<00:00:44.700> install<00:00:45.289> java<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.010> server<00:00:47.239> in

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
will install java on to your server in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
will install java on to your server in
order<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.660> run<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:48.989> minecraft<00:00:49.350> server<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.829> any

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
order to run on minecraft server or any

version I want to copy link address that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.050 
version I want to copy link address that
inside<00:01:52.480> of<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:54.400> terminal<00:01:54.760> we're<00:01:54.880> going

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
inside of the terminal we're going

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.570 
inside of the terminal we're going
through<00:01:55.180> w<00:01:55.450> get<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.229> then<00:01:56.590> right<00:01:57.100> click<00:01:57.340> and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
then we will go ahead and get this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.169 
then we will go ahead and get this
command<00:02:03.910> line<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:06.900> minimize<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.119> we

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
command line and minimize that so now we

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.480 
command line and minimize that so now we
will<00:02:10.360> go<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.810> right<00:02:11.380> click<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.340> can

will go and right click that and you can

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.430 
will go and right click that and you can
start<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> server<00:02:13.120> now<00:02:13.690> if<00:02:13.870> you're<00:02:14.020> using<00:02:14.260> a

start the server now if you're using a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
start the server now if you're using a
one<00:02:14.620> gig<00:02:14.800> droplet<00:02:15.430> you're<00:02:15.550> going<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.970> actually

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
one gig droplet you're going to actually

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.660 
one gig droplet you're going to actually
have<00:02:16.360> problems<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.980> minimum

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
have problems with this so the minimum

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.710 
have problems with this so the minimum
amount<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:19.000> RAM<00:02:19.150> I'm<00:02:19.240> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.570> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
amount of RAM I'm going to have the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.199 
amount of RAM I'm going to have the
server<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.740> be<00:02:20.860> 512<00:02:21.280> megabytes<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
server is going to be 512 megabytes and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.710 
server is going to be 512 megabytes and
the<00:02:22.959> maximum<00:02:23.440> amount<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.709> RAM<00:02:23.890> will<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.520> 75<00:02:25.450> 6

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the maximum amount of RAM will be 75 6

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
the maximum amount of RAM will be 75 6
megabytes<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:27.430> has<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.150> memory

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
megabytes on that has to be just memory

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.530 
megabytes on that has to be just memory
they'll<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.209> remember

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
they'll have just have to with remember

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.650 
they'll have just have to with remember
current<00:02:31.870> memory<00:02:32.019> statistics<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.570> don't

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
current memory statistics so we don't

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.930 
current memory statistics so we don't
use<00:02:34.810> all<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.650> memory<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> server<00:02:36.519> does

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
use all of the memory on the server does

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.600 
use all of the memory on the server does
that<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> kind<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.510> bad<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:39.220> used
