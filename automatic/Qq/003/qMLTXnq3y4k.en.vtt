what the heart I can't talk today don't

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.500 
what the heart I can't talk today don't
worry<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.420> men<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.080> European<00:02:14.680> ethnicity

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
worry this is men of European ethnicity

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.380 
worry this is men of European ethnicity
blah<00:02:16.510> blah<00:02:16.720> blah<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> there's<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.330> arm

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
blah blah blah and so there's that arm

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.449 
blah blah blah and so there's that arm
so<00:02:25.390> we'll<00:02:25.540> switch<00:02:25.750> over<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.200> drug<00:02:26.650> drug

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
so we'll switch over to drug drug

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.290 
so we'll switch over to drug drug
response<00:02:28.000> now<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:29.520> man<00:02:30.520> their<00:02:30.819> website<00:02:31.180> is

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
response now and man their website is

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.559 
response now and man their website is
really<00:02:31.480> slow<00:02:31.840> today<00:02:31.900> um<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:34.030> only<00:02:34.180> thing<00:02:34.270> that

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
really slow today um the only thing that

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.229 
really slow today um the only thing that
I<00:02:34.600> had<00:02:34.930> was<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:36.130> right<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.790> which<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.060> a

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I had was this right here which is a

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.900 
I had was this right here which is a
blood<00:02:37.600> thinner<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.819> I'm

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
blood thinner so I think it so that I'm

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.540 
blood thinner so I think it so that I'm
more<00:02:40.150> sensitive<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.080> which<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.550> pretty

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
more sensitive to it which is pretty

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.190 
more sensitive to it which is pretty
good<00:02:42.730> knowledge<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.239> know<00:02:43.390> um<00:02:45.870> other<00:02:46.870> things

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
good knowledge to know um other things

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.170 
good knowledge to know um other things
these<00:02:47.380> are<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:47.880> typical<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.390> says<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:51.180> we'll

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
these are all typical it says and we'll

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.100 
these are all typical it says and we'll
go<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> inherited<00:02:53.110> conditions<00:02:53.590> now<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.989> yeah

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
go to inherited conditions now but yeah

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.600 
go to inherited conditions now but yeah
they<00:02:56.260> give<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.590> ton<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.860> information<00:02:57.190> on

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
they give you a ton of information on

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.430 
they give you a ton of information on
all<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:57.970> stuff<00:02:58.299> things<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> test<00:02:59.350> for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
all this stuff things that the test for

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.800 
all this stuff things that the test for
so<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.160> that's<00:03:00.280> pretty<00:03:00.549> cool<00:03:00.760> alright<00:03:01.600> so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
so if that's pretty cool alright so

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.039 
so if that's pretty cool alright so
here's<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.470> arm<00:03:03.569> once<00:03:04.569> again<00:03:04.840> it's

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
here's this one arm once again it's

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.690 
here's this one arm once again it's
another<00:03:05.140> heart<00:03:05.560> related<00:03:05.860> thing<00:03:06.160> good<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> know

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
another heart related thing good to know

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.039 
another heart related thing good to know
I<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.000> terrible<00:03:07.239> heart<00:03:08.040> um<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:10.780> least<00:03:10.840> I

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
I have a terrible heart um at least I

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.289 
I have a terrible heart um at least I
think<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.459> I'm<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.880> with<00:03:13.000> iron

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
think it is so I'm going to do with iron

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.069 
think it is so I'm going to do with iron
one<00:03:14.140> mutation<00:03:14.829> in<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.190> gene<00:03:15.970> linked<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.870> that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
one mutation in that gene linked to that

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.819 
one mutation in that gene linked to that
blah<00:03:17.470> blah<00:03:17.650> blah<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:19.329> typically<00:03:20.170> prone<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
blah blah blah not typically prone to

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.520 
blah blah blah not typically prone to
higher<00:03:21.010> levels<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.670> iron<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> body<00:03:22.750> but

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
higher levels of iron in the body but

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.640 
higher levels of iron in the body but
can<00:03:23.769> pass<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.370> mutation<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.000> offspring<00:03:26.280> okay

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
can pass the mutation to offspring okay

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.289 
can pass the mutation to offspring okay
so<00:03:29.650> that's<00:03:29.829> cool<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.220> think<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:30.910> says<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.269> I

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
so that's cool I think that says that I

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.900 
so that's cool I think that says that I
don't<00:03:31.570> actually<00:03:31.750> have<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:33.370> typically

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
don't actually have it not typically

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.770 
don't actually have it not typically
from<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.359> can<00:03:34.570> give<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.440> my<00:03:36.010> kid<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:37.570> I

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
from but I can give it to my kid if I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.449 
from but I can give it to my kid if I
have<00:03:37.989> one<00:03:40.560> okay<00:03:41.560> yeah<00:03:42.310> something<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.970> do<00:03:43.150> with

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
have one okay yeah something to do with

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.900 
have one okay yeah something to do with
blood<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.700> iron<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.359> such

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
blood and iron and such

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.130 
blood and iron and such
and<00:03:49.590> we'll<00:03:50.590> go<00:03:50.770> over<00:03:50.890> two<00:03:51.010> traits<00:03:51.340> now<00:03:52.140> allow

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
and we'll go over two traits now allow

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.110 
and we'll go over two traits now allow
this<00:03:53.350> health<00:03:53.590> stuff<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.070> pretty<00:03:54.280> boring<00:03:54.550> but

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
this health stuff is pretty boring but

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.600 
this health stuff is pretty boring but
you<00:03:55.960> know<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:58.000> stuff<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.300> pretty<00:03:58.570> cool

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
you know this stuff is pretty cool

you know this stuff is pretty cool
alcohol<00:04:00.610> flush<00:04:00.910> reaction<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:02.200> like<00:04:02.440> you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
alcohol flush reaction that's like you

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.980 
alcohol flush reaction that's like you
cannot<00:04:03.460> drink<00:04:03.790> alcohol<00:04:04.270> at<00:04:04.420> all<00:04:04.540> you'll<00:04:04.780> just

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
cannot drink alcohol at all you'll just

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.820 
cannot drink alcohol at all you'll just
like<00:04:05.110> throw<00:04:05.410> up<00:04:05.440> bitter<00:04:06.370> taste<00:04:06.790> perception

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
like throw up bitter taste perception

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.790 
like throw up bitter taste perception
yeah<00:04:08.830> that's<00:04:09.160> cool<00:04:09.430> earwax<00:04:10.300> type<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:11.020> color

pattern<00:04:33.130> baldness<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.950> pretty<00:04:36.190> cool<00:04:36.490> I

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
pattern baldness this is pretty cool I

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.310 
pattern baldness this is pretty cool I
thought<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.210> was<00:04:37.390> going<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.600> be<00:04:37.690> bold<00:04:37.960> because

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
thought I was going to be bold because

being bald in am older so it's pretty

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.270 
being bald in am older so it's pretty
cool<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.960> one<00:04:56.200> muscle<00:04:56.620> performance<00:04:56.800> I

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
cool this one muscle performance I

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.690 
cool this one muscle performance I
thought<00:04:57.460> this<00:04:57.610> was<00:04:57.760> pretty<00:04:57.910> cool<00:04:58.150> too<00:04:58.390> um

than<00:05:21.040> endurance<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:21.970> think<00:05:22.180> that's

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
than endurance and I think that's

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.670 
than endurance and I think that's
totally<00:05:22.510> true<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:22.930> hate<00:05:23.200> running<00:05:23.530> for

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
totally true I hate running for

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.250 
totally true I hate running for
endurance<00:05:24.600> running<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:25.750> general<00:05:26.140> is<00:05:26.230> just

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
much as far far east to Europe you can

my<00:06:10.240> father's<00:06:10.570> side<00:06:13.080> this<00:06:14.080> one<00:06:14.350> shows<00:06:14.650> that<00:06:14.680> I'm

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
my father's side this one shows that I'm

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.610 
my father's side this one shows that I'm
mostly<00:06:15.610> Scandinavian<00:06:16.510> which<00:06:16.660> I<00:06:16.930> did<00:06:17.260> not<00:06:17.410> know

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
mostly Scandinavian which I did not know

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.350 
mostly Scandinavian which I did not know
at<00:06:17.770> all<00:06:17.890> so<00:06:18.340> that's<00:06:18.670> pretty<00:06:18.910> cool

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
at all so that's pretty cool

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.710 
at all so that's pretty cool
and<00:06:19.720> this<00:06:19.810> one's<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.050> lot<00:06:20.170> darker<00:06:20.560> too<00:06:21.010> like<00:06:21.850> 50%

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
and this one's a lot darker too like 50%

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.360 
and this one's a lot darker too like 50%
all<00:06:22.930> that<00:06:23.670> and<00:06:24.670> it'll<00:06:24.850> give<00:06:25.000> you<00:06:25.090> history<00:06:25.330> and

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
all that and it'll give you history and

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.290 
all that and it'll give you history and
haploid<00:06:27.370> tree<00:06:28.020> pretty<00:06:29.020> cool<00:06:29.230> stuff

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
haploid tree pretty cool stuff

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.300 
haploid tree pretty cool stuff
so<00:06:31.300> this<00:06:31.780> one<00:06:32.700> this<00:06:33.700> one<00:06:33.940> says<00:06:34.350> that<00:06:35.350> I'm<00:06:35.500> 2.8

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
so this one this one says that I'm 2.8

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.690 
so this one this one says that I'm 2.8
percent<00:06:36.490> Neanderthal<00:06:37.150> and<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:38.830> average<00:06:39.370> is

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
percent Neanderthal and the average is

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.420 
percent Neanderthal and the average is
2.7<00:06:40.540> I'm<00:06:40.630> pretty<00:06:40.960> sure<00:06:41.170> this<00:06:41.350> is<00:06:41.410> just<00:06:41.920> the

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
2.7 I'm pretty sure this is just the

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.530 
2.7 I'm pretty sure this is just the
people<00:06:42.790> on<00:06:42.970> the<00:06:43.060> website

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
people on the website

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.050 
people on the website
I<00:06:43.690> might<00:06:43.900> not<00:06:44.110> actually<00:06:44.470> be<00:06:44.770> more<00:06:45.400> neanderthal

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
I might not actually be more neanderthal

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.360 
I might not actually be more neanderthal
than<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.450> average<00:06:47.020> Joe<00:06:47.320> but<00:06:47.620> on<00:06:47.800> this<00:06:48.160> website

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
than the average Joe but on this website

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.940 
than the average Joe but on this website
