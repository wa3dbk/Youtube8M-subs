00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
doesn't shoot accurately because of the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
doesn't shoot accurately because of the
burst<00:00:54.750> fire<00:00:55.730> mainly<00:00:57.170> not<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.410> let<00:00:58.739> alone<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
burst fire mainly not not let alone that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.130 
burst fire mainly not not let alone that
its<00:00:59.340> assault<00:00:59.730> rifle<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> fact<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
its assault rifle but the fact that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
its assault rifle but the fact that
adding<00:01:01.559> bad<00:01:02.100> effects<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.270> with

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
adding bad effects to it you know with

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
adding bad effects to it you know with
the<00:01:03.539> burst<00:01:03.809> fire<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.220> put<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the burst fire so I'm I just put the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
the burst fire so I'm I just put the
master<00:01:05.880> key<00:01:06.030> attachment<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.810> which

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
master key attachment on here which

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
master key attachment on here which
eliminates<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.770> problems<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.280> close<00:01:08.460> range

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
eliminates all problems at close range

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
eliminates all problems at close range
because<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> master<00:01:09.479> key<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> almost<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because the master key is almost as I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
because the master key is almost as I
would<00:01:11.010> almost<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:12.000> personally<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.630> say

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
would almost say me personally would say

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
would almost say me personally would say
it's<00:01:12.900> better<00:01:13.140> than<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.650> stake<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it's better than they stake out or the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's better than they stake out or the
HS<00:01:15.900> 10<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> something<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
HS 10 you know something like that I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.560 
HS 10 you know something like that I
wouldn't<00:01:17.610> say<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.909> better<00:01:18.030> than<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.299> pass

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
wouldn't say it's better than this pass

recommend a flamethrower or something
that<00:01:28.110> could<00:01:28.310> suffice<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.820> close-range<00:01:31.189> um

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that could suffice for a close-range um

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.130 
that could suffice for a close-range um
I<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:33.000> even<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.390> call<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> close

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
