today

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.770 

on<00:02:11.569> hot<00:02:12.110> humid<00:02:12.590> days<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.310> little<00:02:14.120> bit<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.329> cotton

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
on hot humid days a little bit of cotton

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.740 
on hot humid days a little bit of cotton
may<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.439> a<00:02:15.469> hard<00:02:15.799> time<00:02:15.980> igniting<00:02:16.609> so<00:02:17.540> what<00:02:17.719> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
may have a hard time igniting so what I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.199 
may have a hard time igniting so what I
suggest<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.379> using<00:02:18.859> just<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.579> dab<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:20.150> Vaseline

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
suggest is using just a dab of Vaseline

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.470 
suggest is using just a dab of Vaseline
