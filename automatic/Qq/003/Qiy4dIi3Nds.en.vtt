don't<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.590> why<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.840> wouldn't<00:01:57.840> um<00:01:58.049> most<00:01:58.890> people

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
don't know why I wouldn't um most people

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
don't know why I wouldn't um most people
think<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.119> mean<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> chiffon

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079

release<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.610> mean<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.000> probably

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
release of this I mean it's probably

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.399 
release of this I mean it's probably
somewhere<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> Disney<00:02:05.969> really

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
somewhere but this was the Disney really

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.949 
somewhere but this was the Disney really
on<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.700> makes<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.179> actually<00:02:08.630> probably

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
on it so this makes it actually probably

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.589 
on it so this makes it actually probably
and<00:02:09.289> down<00:02:09.500> there<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.099> tell<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:11.120> usually
