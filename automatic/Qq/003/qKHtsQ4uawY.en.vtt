00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
to be talking about what I refer to as

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.799 
to be talking about what I refer to as
the<00:00:13.050> pseudo<00:00:13.800> see<00:00:14.219> recombination<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the pseudo see recombination this

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.070 
the pseudo see recombination this
combination<00:00:16.439> uses<00:00:17.599> multiple<00:00:18.599> jailbreak

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
combination uses multiple jailbreak

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.790 
combination uses multiple jailbreak
tweaks<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.649> again<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.489> do<00:00:20.700> need<00:00:21.259> your<00:00:22.259> phone

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
tweaks and again you do need your phone

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.389 
tweaks and again you do need your phone
to<00:00:22.919> be<00:00:23.040> jailbroken<00:00:23.599> for<00:00:24.599> you<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:26.130> able<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:26.399 
to be jailbroken for you to be able to

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.979 
to be jailbroken for you to be able to
use<00:00:26.489> this<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:29.520> first<00:00:29.939> part<00:00:30.360> of<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
use this so the first part of this

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.770 
use this so the first part of this
combination<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.919> voice<00:00:32.250> activated<00:00:32.719> now<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
combination is voice activated now you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.470 
combination is voice activated now you
do<00:00:34.110> need<00:00:34.350> activator<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.250> really<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:36.000> any<00:00:36.150> use

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
do need activator to really get any use

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
do need activator to really get any use
out<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:38.310> voice-activated<00:00:38.730> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
out of this but with voice-activated you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.870 
out of this but with voice-activated you
can<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:39.840> take<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.830> voice<00:00:41.220> control<00:00:41.460> that

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
have to be a website that you find on a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.080 
have to be a website that you find on a
browser<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.770> open<00:02:02.090> various

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
browser you can actually open various

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.930 
browser you can actually open various
different<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.660> files<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.620> know<00:02:04.910> how<00:02:05.910> to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
different on files if you know how to

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.040 
different on files if you know how to
write<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.820> example<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.420> voice

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
write it out for example the voice

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
write it out for example the voice
activator<00:02:10.649> which<00:02:10.770> comes<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:12.560> annika<00:02:13.560> comes

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
activator which comes with annika comes

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.190 
activator which comes with annika comes
as<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.190> your<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:14.610> commands<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.870> takes

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
as one of your first commands it takes

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.830 
as one of your first commands it takes
you<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> cydia<00:02:17.160> page<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:18.540> voice

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you to the cydia page for voice

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.030 
you to the cydia page for voice
activator<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:22.040> various

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
activator so you can have various

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
activator so you can have various
different<00:02:23.520> um<00:02:24.020> commands<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.750> don't<00:02:27.750> think

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
different um commands here I don't think

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.490 
different um commands here I don't think
there<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.110> actually<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> limit<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.350> then<00:02:31.350> when

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
there is actually a limit and then when

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.420 
there is actually a limit and then when
you<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.739> done<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.550> figure<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:35.310> can

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
you get done and you can figure you can

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.020 
you get done and you can figure you can
click<00:02:35.640> Save<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.830> activator<00:02:38.489> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
click Save but here with activator it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.630 
click Save but here with activator it
allows<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:40.410> anything<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.890> activator

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
allows you to do anything that activator

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.130 
allows you to do anything that activator
can<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.600> don't<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> have

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
can do so you don't have to have

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.970 
can do so you don't have to have
activator<00:02:46.769> but<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:49.140> get<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> most<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
activator but you get the most out of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
activator but you get the most out of
this<00:02:50.640> tweak<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:53.420> okay<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.750> next

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
this tweak if you do okay so the next

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.990 
this tweak if you do okay so the next
