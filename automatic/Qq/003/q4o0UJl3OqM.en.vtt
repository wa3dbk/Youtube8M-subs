YouTube<00:02:23.220> or<00:02:23.310> Vimeo<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
YouTube or Vimeo right here it is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.660 
YouTube or Vimeo right here it is
recommended<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:26.010> use<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> self

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
recommended that you do use a self

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.010 
recommended that you do use a self
hosted<00:02:26.790> video<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.630> works<00:02:27.810> better

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
hosted video because it works better

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.170 
hosted video because it works better
with<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.290> parallax<00:02:28.800> effects<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> you're

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
with the parallax effects and you're

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.670 
with the parallax effects and you're
going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.330> get<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.570> more<00:02:30.870> functionality

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
going to get just more functionality

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.380 
going to get just more functionality
because<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.250> easier<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> control<00:02:32.910> something

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
because it's easier to control something

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
because it's easier to control something
that's<00:02:33.570> actually<00:02:33.810> located<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.590> your<00:02:34.680> site

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that's actually located on your site

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.290 
that's actually located on your site
rather<00:02:35.070> than<00:02:35.160> embedded<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:35.880> somewhere<00:02:36.270> else

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
rather than embedded from somewhere else

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.660 
rather than embedded from somewhere else
so<00:02:36.960> also<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> do<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.100> self<00:02:38.280> hosted

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
so also if you do go the self hosted

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.340 
so also if you do go the self hosted
route<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.660> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> make<00:02:39.959> sure<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.110> you

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
route you need to make sure that you

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.050 
route you need to make sure that you
supply<00:02:40.650> both<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> file<00:02:41.370> formats<00:02:41.820> if<00:02:41.970> you

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
supply both of the file formats if you

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.310 
supply both of the file formats if you
don't<00:02:42.300> you're<00:02:42.720> not<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.140> cross

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
