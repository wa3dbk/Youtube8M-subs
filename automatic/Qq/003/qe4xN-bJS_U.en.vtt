so in this tutorial I forgive you guys
some<00:00:02.580> tips<00:00:02.820> on<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.210> would<00:00:03.629> draw<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> mountain

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
some tips on how I would draw a mountain

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.820 
some tips on how I would draw a mountain
scape<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:05.970> pen<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.210> ink<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.660> did<00:00:07.290> tutorial<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
scape in pen and ink I did tutorial a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.360 
scape in pen and ink I did tutorial a
while<00:00:08.189> ago<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.519> using<00:00:09.290> basic<00:00:10.290> forms<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.889> draw

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
while ago on using basic forms to draw

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
while ago on using basic forms to draw
mountains<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> guess<00:00:12.780> I'll

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
mountains and so on so I guess I'll

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900 
mountains and so on so I guess I'll
pretty<00:00:13.170> much<00:00:13.320> apply<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> same<00:00:14.490> thing<00:00:14.700> here<00:00:14.880> so

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
pretty much apply the same thing here so

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.189 
pretty much apply the same thing here so
you'll<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.070> guess<00:00:17.600> I<00:00:18.600> could

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
you'll see how I do it I guess I could

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.429 
you'll see how I do it I guess I could
just<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.949> know<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.990> overlap<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.260> guess

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
just you know I'm just overlap I guess

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.840 
just you know I'm just overlap I guess
have<00:00:22.619> two<00:00:22.769> mountains<00:00:23.070> overlap<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> sense

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
have two mountains overlap in a sense

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000 
have two mountains overlap in a sense
maybe<00:00:24.600> put<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:24.990> house<00:00:25.320> somewhere<00:00:25.619> on

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
maybe put a little house somewhere on

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.319 
maybe put a little house somewhere on
here<00:00:28.760> if<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:29.970> another<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:32.640> have

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
here if you have another one here I have

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
here if you have another one here I have
another<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> background<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
another one in the background here so

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.560 
another one in the background here so
I'm<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.489> catching<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.180> now

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I'm just catching it out right now

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.869 
I'm just catching it out right now
and<00:00:36.860> maybe<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> could<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> tree<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.790> or

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and maybe you could put a tree here or

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
and maybe you could put a tree here or
something<00:00:39.239> mm-hmm<00:00:41.750> put<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:42.899> trees<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
something mm-hmm put some trees in the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
something mm-hmm put some trees in the
background<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> my

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
background like you know this will be my

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.060 
background like you know this will be my
guess<00:00:45.629> maybe<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.110> foreground<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
guess maybe like in the foreground this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
guess maybe like in the foreground this
mountain<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> foreground<00:00:48.059> could

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
mountain will be in the foreground could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.590 
mountain will be in the foreground could
have<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.410> house<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.590> somewhere<00:00:50.309> so

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
have a little house here somewhere so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
have a little house here somewhere so
I'm<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> lay<00:00:52.110> things<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.530> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I'm just going to lay things out in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
I'm just going to lay things out in
pencil<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
pencil and then you know from here it's

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
pencil and then you know from here it's
just<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.410> matter<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> how<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> will<00:00:58.879> render

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
just a matter of how I will render

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.180 
just a matter of how I will render
everything<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.539> ink<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> already

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
everything in ink but you can already

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.850 
everything in ink but you can already
get<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.609> idea<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> know<00:01:03.500> how<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.830> just

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
get an idea if you know how you can just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
get an idea if you know how you can just
get<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> basic<00:01:06.119> layout<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> where<00:01:07.439> everything

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
get a basic layout of where everything

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
get a basic layout of where everything
is<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> mountain<00:01:09.240> scape

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
is I'm going to put a mountain scape

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
is I'm going to put a mountain scape
here<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> notice<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.049> starting<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
here and notice that I'm starting just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
here and notice that I'm starting just
with<00:01:11.450> general<00:01:12.450> shapes<00:01:12.780> there's<00:01:12.990> nothing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
with general shapes there's nothing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
with general shapes there's nothing
specific<00:01:14.010> or<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.000> detailed<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.689> I'm

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
specific or you know detailed here I'm

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
specific or you know detailed here I'm
just<00:01:15.869> starting<00:01:16.200> generalize<00:01:16.680> again<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> always

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
just starting generalize again I always

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
just starting generalize again I always
encourage<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> guys<00:01:18.689> start<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.350> know

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
encourage that you guys start you know

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.249 
encourage that you guys start you know
pretty<00:01:19.799> general<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:21.420> drawings<00:01:22.080> don't

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pretty general with your drawings don't

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
pretty general with your drawings don't
you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.950> into<00:01:23.100> too<00:01:23.310> much<00:01:23.340> detail<00:01:23.700> too

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you know go into too much detail too

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
you know go into too much detail too
early<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.830> beginning

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
early just you know in your beginning

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.230 
early just you know in your beginning
stages<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.759> feel<00:01:26.939> things<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:29.240> kind

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
stages just feel things up you know kind

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
stages just feel things up you know kind
of<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.450> feel<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> drawing<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:32.070> sense

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of like feel the drawing out in a sense

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.940 
of like feel the drawing out in a sense
and<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.670> let<00:01:32.820> things<00:01:33.000> gradually<00:01:33.869> build<00:01:34.079> up

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:02:07.709 

you

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.660 

and<00:02:08.590> that's<00:02:08.739> pretty<00:02:08.860> much<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.369> if<00:02:09.580> you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and that's pretty much it so if you

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.089 
and that's pretty much it so if you
notice<00:02:09.879> I<00:02:09.970> kind<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.269> have<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.440> lot<00:02:11.980> of

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
notice I kind of have the the lot of

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.500 
notice I kind of have the the lot of
overlap<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.819> on<00:02:12.940> we're<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.330> use<00:02:13.480> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
overlap going on we're going to use a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970 
overlap going on we're going to use a
little<00:02:13.750> tree<00:02:13.959> here<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> kind<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.470> break<00:02:14.739> this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
little tree here to kind of break this

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890 
little tree here to kind of break this
this<00:02:15.610> contour<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.510> makes<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
this contour here it just makes it a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.720 
this contour here it just makes it a
little<00:02:17.049> bit<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.349> more<00:02:18.250> interesting<00:02:18.670> a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
little bit more more interesting a

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.479 
little bit more more interesting a
little<00:02:18.910> more<00:02:19.060> dynamic<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> I'm<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
little more dynamic so I'm just going to

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.280 
little more dynamic so I'm just going to
go<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.000> start<00:02:22.180> laying<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> what<00:02:23.230> I'm

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
go in and start laying and what I'm

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
go in and start laying and what I'm
going<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.470> try<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.120> layer<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.330> two

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
going to try to do is layer in two

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.309 
going to try to do is layer in two
values<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:28.540> layer<00:02:28.750> at<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:28.930> so

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
values so that one layer at a time so

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.830 
values so that one layer at a time so
that<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.739> see<00:02:29.890> how<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> build<00:02:30.459> up<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.180> forms

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
that we can see how I build up the forms

00:02:31.840 --> 00:05:12.480 
that we can see how I build up the forms
and<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.080> texture<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.739> on

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.920 

and<00:05:13.490> that's<00:05:13.760> pretty<00:05:13.970> much<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:14.419> you<00:05:14.660> can<00:05:14.840> get

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
and that's pretty much it so you can get

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.120 
and that's pretty much it so you can get
an<00:05:15.050> idea<00:05:15.350> if<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.620> know<00:05:15.740> if<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:15.860> want<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.040> do<00:05:16.100> a

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
an idea if you know if you want to do a

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.590 
an idea if you know if you want to do a
drawing<00:05:16.370> like<00:05:16.550> this<00:05:16.730> just<00:05:17.270> start<00:05:17.480> out<00:05:17.570> with

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
drawing like this just start out with

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.180 
drawing like this just start out with
your<00:05:17.780> basic<00:05:17.960> forms<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.680> worry<00:05:18.860> about<00:05:18.919> the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
your basic forms and worry about the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.129 
your basic forms and worry about the
details<00:05:19.550> later<00:05:19.639> and<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.360> know<00:05:20.510> that's<00:05:21.020> pretty

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
details later and you know that's pretty

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.180 
details later and you know that's pretty
much<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:26.000> it
