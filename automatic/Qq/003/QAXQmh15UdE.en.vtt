great<00:00:27.829> features<00:00:28.069> you<00:00:28.460> know<00:00:28.550> first<00:00:28.819> off<00:00:29.060> let's

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
great features you know first off let's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.849 
great features you know first off let's
look<00:00:29.359> at<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.720> outside<00:00:29.899> of<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.439> unit<00:00:30.710> right

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
look at the outside of the unit right

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.400 
look at the outside of the unit right
here<00:00:30.919> you've<00:00:31.519> got<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:31.730> four<00:00:32.029> inch<00:00:32.239> no<00:00:32.840> blow<00:00:33.110> cone

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
here you've got a four inch no blow cone

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.990 
here you've got a four inch no blow cone
and<00:00:33.710> what<00:00:33.860> that<00:00:34.040> does<00:00:34.220> is<00:00:34.550> helps<00:00:34.820> eliminate

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
and what that does is helps eliminate

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.180 
and what that does is helps eliminate
grain<00:00:35.540> waste<00:00:35.870> when<00:00:36.109> you<00:00:36.199> get<00:00:36.379> high<00:00:36.559> winds<00:00:37.100> that

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
grain waste when you get high winds that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.709 
grain waste when you get high winds that
are<00:00:37.250> going<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.550> move<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.910> feeder<00:00:38.149> or<00:00:38.329> shake<00:00:38.539> it

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
are going to move a feeder or shake it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.779 
are going to move a feeder or shake it
around<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.199> keeps<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.859> feed<00:00:40.100> sucked<00:00:40.489> down<00:00:40.640> in

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
around it keeps that feed sucked down in

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.700 
around it keeps that feed sucked down in
there<00:00:40.969> you've<00:00:41.480> got<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.750> built<00:00:42.109> in<00:00:42.289> comb<00:00:42.530> that

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
there you've got a built in comb that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.110 
there you've got a built in comb that
comes<00:00:42.890> straight<00:00:43.129> out<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.370> your<00:00:43.519> feeder<00:00:43.760> as<00:00:43.969> you

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
comes straight out of your feeder as you

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.459 
comes straight out of your feeder as you
look<00:00:44.300> at<00:00:44.420> where<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.690> mounted<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:45.170> and

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
look at where you mounted that and

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.560 
look at where you mounted that and
you've<00:00:45.590> also<00:00:45.859> got<00:00:46.309> a<00:00:46.340> built<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:46.910> varmint<00:00:47.390> guard

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
you've also got a built in varmint guard

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.849 
you've also got a built in varmint guard
it's<00:00:47.809> going<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.019> make<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.260> harder<00:00:48.559> for<00:00:48.710> those

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
it's going to make it harder for those

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.740 
it's going to make it harder for those
pesky<00:00:49.489> critters<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.179> you<00:00:50.329> don't<00:00:50.510> want

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
climbing up on your feet to get in there

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.459 
climbing up on your feet to get in there
and<00:00:52.609> get<00:00:52.760> as<00:00:52.879> much<00:00:53.059> grain<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:54.050> when<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.289> go

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
and get as much grain now when you go

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.770 
and get as much grain now when you go
inside<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.980> unit<00:00:55.460> itself<00:00:55.789> it's<00:00:56.120> very<00:00:56.179> simple
