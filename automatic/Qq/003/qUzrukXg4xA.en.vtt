00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the energy to go into it all now but

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.240 
the energy to go into it all now but
it's<00:00:50.030> basically<00:00:51.030> forced<00:00:51.390> Mars<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.160> know

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's basically forced Mars made you know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's basically forced Mars made you know
the<00:00:53.430> Mars<00:00:53.640> founder<00:00:54.360> made<00:00:55.020> both<00:00:55.199> come<00:00:55.410> made

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the Mars founder made both come made

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
the Mars founder made both come made
both<00:00:55.890> bars<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.820> they're<00:00:57.360> different<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
both bars and they're different in the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.549 
both bars and they're different in the

UK in the United States and Canada and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.200 
UK in the United States and Canada and
everyone's<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.460> slightly<00:01:02.850> different

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
everyone's got some slightly different

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.460 
everyone's got some slightly different
versions<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.140> limited

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
versions of it and there's limited

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
versions of it and there's limited
editions<00:01:04.949> available<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.000> different

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
editions available now on all different

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
editions available now on all different
countries<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.369> complicated

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
countries and it's a pretty complicated

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
countries and it's a pretty complicated
thing<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.540> let's<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.680> worry

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
thing so let's just not really worry

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.420 
thing so let's just not really worry
about<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
about it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.270 
about it
suffice<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.180> Mars<00:01:12.990> bars<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.590> very

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
suffice it to say Mars bars are very

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.600 
suffice it to say Mars bars are very
good<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> very<00:01:15.180> popular<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:16.100> over<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> world

the Milky Way midnight which had the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.730 
the Milky Way midnight which had the
midnight<00:02:36.750> dark<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.560> called

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
midnight dark I think it was called

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.050 
midnight dark I think it was called
which<00:02:38.220> has<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.200> vanilla<00:02:40.200> nougat<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
which has the vanilla nougat in it and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.850 
which has the vanilla nougat in it and
if<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.420> does<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.960> vanilla<00:02:43.320> nougat<00:02:43.740> I

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
if this does have that vanilla nougat I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.470 
if this does have that vanilla nougat I
would<00:02:43.980> imagine<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.430> very<00:02:44.490> very<00:02:44.940> similar

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
would imagine it's very very similar

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.650 
would imagine it's very very similar

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
something about them some chocolate bars

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.420 
something about them some chocolate bars
are<00:03:39.690> actually<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.440> little<00:03:40.950> bit<00:03:41.040> better<00:03:41.190> when

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
are actually a little bit better when

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.290 
are actually a little bit better when
they're<00:03:41.550> just<00:03:41.790> slightly<00:03:42.480> melty<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.970> think

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
they're just slightly melty and I think

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.440 
they're just slightly melty and I think
this<00:03:45.450> may<00:03:45.630> be<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.990> of<00:03:46.440> those<00:03:46.530> cases<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:47.240> am<00:03:48.240> a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
this may be one of those cases I am a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.900 
this may be one of those cases I am a
big<00:03:48.870> big<00:03:49.050> fan<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.709> Mars<00:03:49.920> nougat<00:03:50.310> it's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
big big fan of the Mars nougat it's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.740 
big big fan of the Mars nougat it's
fluffy<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.690> light<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.610> caramel<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.330> always

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
fluffy it's light the caramel is always

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.560 
fluffy it's light the caramel is always
a<00:03:54.780> great<00:03:55.110> consistency<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.450> melting<00:03:57.450> is

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
a great consistency and that melting is

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.960 
a great consistency and that melting is
kind<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.810> helps<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.200> little<00:03:58.410> bit<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:59.370> think

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
kind of helps it a little bit I think

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.400 
kind of helps it a little bit I think
I'm<00:04:00.090> probably<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.570> bigger<00:04:00.780> fan<00:04:00.990> of<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.230> milk

Mars dark that's great
I<00:04:37.480> still<00:04:38.480> think<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> prefer<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.190> traditional

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
I still think I prefer the traditional

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.510 
I still think I prefer the traditional
Mars<00:04:40.700> milk<00:04:41.150> chocolate<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.830> definitely

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
Mars milk chocolate but I definitely

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.900 
Mars milk chocolate but I definitely
would<00:04:43.640> not<00:04:43.820> pass<00:04:44.090> this<00:04:44.390> up<00:04:44.920> well<00:04:45.920> I<00:04:46.280> think<00:04:46.760> if

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
would not pass this up well I think if
