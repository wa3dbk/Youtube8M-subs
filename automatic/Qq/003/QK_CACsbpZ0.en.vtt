jailbroken youtube it it'll be the
easiest<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.570> did<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> i<00:01:52.290> got

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
easiest way that's what i did and i got

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.730 
easiest way that's what i did and i got
it<00:01:52.560> done<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.939> does<00:01:54.590> would<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.740> warranty<00:01:56.100> bad
