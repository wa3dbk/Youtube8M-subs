these<00:00:00.149> are<00:00:00.329> just<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.659> few<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.500> ways<00:00:01.800> that

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
these are just a few of the ways that

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.370 
these are just a few of the ways that
the<00:00:03.030> students<00:00:03.480> can<00:00:03.689> he<00:00:03.870> use<00:00:04.020> different

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
the students can he use different

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.619 
the students can he use different
strategies<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.040> adding<00:00:05.640> two-digit<00:00:05.850> numbers

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
strategies for adding two-digit numbers

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
strategies for adding two-digit numbers
the<00:00:07.049> first<00:00:07.379> strategy<00:00:07.589> we'll<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.130> looking<00:00:08.280> at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the first strategy we'll be looking at

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.680 
the first strategy we'll be looking at
is<00:00:08.760> place<00:00:09.090> value<00:00:09.599> if<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.740> add<00:00:10.889> 32

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
is place value if I'm going to add 32

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.460 
is place value if I'm going to add 32
plus<00:00:12.710> 24<00:00:14.330> I'll<00:00:15.330> break<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.780> down<00:00:15.809> into<00:00:16.139> place

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
plus 24 I'll break it down into place

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.220 
plus 24 I'll break it down into place
value<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:16.949> gonna<00:00:17.100> break<00:00:17.310> them<00:00:17.460> 32<00:00:18.090> into<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.750> 30

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
value I'm gonna break them 32 into a 30

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
value I'm gonna break them 32 into a 30
and<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> 2<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.330> break<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> 24<00:00:22.260> down<00:00:22.529> into<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> 20

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and a 2 and break the 24 down into a 20

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.230 
and a 2 and break the 24 down into a 20
and<00:00:24.449> i-4<00:00:25.160> then<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> add<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.910> tens

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and i-4 then I'm going to add my tens

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
and i-4 then I'm going to add my tens
place<00:00:27.599> together<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.949> 30<00:00:29.250> plus

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
place together and I know that 30 plus

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290 
place together and I know that 30 plus
20<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.359> 50<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> add<00:00:32.279> my<00:00:32.520> ones<00:00:32.880> place

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
20 is 50 I'm going to add my ones place

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
20 is 50 I'm going to add my ones place
and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> 2<00:00:34.260> plus<00:00:35.070> 4<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.760> 6<00:00:36.920> then<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and then have that 2 plus 4 is 6 then I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.709 
and then have that 2 plus 4 is 6 then I
know<00:00:38.129> 50<00:00:38.760> plus<00:00:39.149> 6<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.820> 56<00:00:44.719> another

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
know 50 plus 6 is the same as 56 another

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.350 
know 50 plus 6 is the same as 56 another
strategy<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.940> adding

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
strategy that you can use for adding

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
strategy that you can use for adding
two-digit<00:00:48.570> numbers<00:00:49.200> taking<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> same<00:00:50.309> number

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
two-digit numbers taking the same number

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
two-digit numbers taking the same number
32<00:00:51.750> plus<00:00:52.530> 24<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.750> adding<00:00:54.750> by<00:00:54.930> using<00:00:55.350> base<00:00:55.649> ten

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
32 plus 24 is adding by using base ten

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.729 
32 plus 24 is adding by using base ten
blocks<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> may<00:00:57.629> say<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> students<00:00:58.440> draw<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
blocks you may say the students draw the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.990 
blocks you may say the students draw the
place<00:00:59.190> value<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.690> 10<00:01:01.430> 20<00:01:02.989> 30<00:01:04.220> 31<00:01:05.220> 32<00:01:06.619> plus

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
place value we have 10 20 30 31 32 plus

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.740 
place value we have 10 20 30 31 32 plus
10<00:01:09.890> 20<00:01:11.510> 21<00:01:12.650> 22<00:01:13.650> 23<00:01:13.850> 24<00:01:15.560> then<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:16.979> add<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
10 20 21 22 23 24 then they will add the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.649 
10 20 21 22 23 24 then they will add the
tens<00:01:19.049> place<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.830> 30<00:01:20.340> plus<00:01:20.729> 20<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.630> have

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
tens place you have 30 plus 20 we have

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.670 
tens place you have 30 plus 20 we have
50<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> 2<00:01:23.369> plus<00:01:24.180> 4<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.869> 6<00:01:26.240> 15<00:01:27.240> plus<00:01:27.810> 6<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
50 and 2 plus 4 is 6 15 plus 6 is the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
50 and 2 plus 4 is 6 15 plus 6 is the
same<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:29.210> 56<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:31.460> third<00:01:32.460> strategy<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.270> some<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
same as 56 a third strategy that some of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020 
same as 56 a third strategy that some of
