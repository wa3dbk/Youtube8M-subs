00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410 
guide for now will be a trophy guide
later<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.889> well<00:00:14.130> when<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> ordinance<00:00:15.269> comes

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
later as well when that ordinance comes

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.320 
later as well when that ordinance comes
out<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.690> ps3<00:00:16.440> anyways<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.060> four

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
out on ps3 anyways there are four

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.550 
out on ps3 anyways there are four
challenges<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:18.930> thought<00:00:19.170> when<00:00:19.380> they

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
challenges and I thought when they

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
challenges and I thought when they
announced<00:00:20.369> challenges<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.210> black<00:00:21.600> ops<00:00:21.630> 2

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
announced challenges for black ops 2

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.060 
announced challenges for black ops 2
origins<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.410> thought<00:00:22.560> maybe<00:00:22.710> they're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
origins I thought maybe they're going to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.470 
origins I thought maybe they're going to
add<00:00:23.189> challenges<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> other<00:00:24.000> maps<00:00:24.240> but

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
add challenges to the other maps but

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.509 
add challenges to the other maps but
it's<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.109> Matt<00:00:25.680> specific<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
it's like in Matt specific and it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's like in Matt specific and it
actually<00:00:26.699> gives<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.240> rewards<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.320> don't

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
actually gives you rewards so I don't

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.980 
actually gives you rewards so I don't
that's<00:00:29.070> definitely<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.910> case<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.720> first

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that's definitely not the case the first

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
that's definitely not the case the first
