read on reviews as the back stitching
might<00:04:36.050> come<00:04:36.260> out<00:04:37.720> which<00:04:38.720> would<00:04:39.260> be<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.500> bummer

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
might come out which would be a bummer

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.820 
might come out which would be a bummer
but<00:04:41.540> i<00:04:41.600> think<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.080> order<00:04:42.380> from<00:04:42.500> sports

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
but i think if you order from sports

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.190 
but i think if you order from sports
authority<00:04:42.919> they<00:04:43.400> cover<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.419> hopefully

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
authority they cover that so hopefully

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.020 
authority they cover that so hopefully
it<00:04:45.410> won't<00:04:45.620> happen<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.250> if<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.490> does<00:04:46.550> hopefully

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
it won't happen but if it does hopefully

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.350 
it won't happen but if it does hopefully
I'm<00:04:47.560> able<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.800> get<00:04:48.890> some<00:04:49.100> more<00:04:49.280> because<00:04:49.700> as<00:04:50.000> of
