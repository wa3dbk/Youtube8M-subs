00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.280 
made a whole bunch of marble icons of
famous<00:06:00.350> Marvel<00:06:00.710> characters<00:06:01.070> that<00:06:01.220> you<00:06:01.280> see

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
and I was thinking of getting a

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.760 
and I was thinking of getting a
ghostwriter<00:06:04.850> however<00:06:05.300> I'm<00:06:05.450> not<00:06:05.570> sure

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
ghostwriter however I'm not sure

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.590 
ghostwriter however I'm not sure
but<00:06:07.770> we'll<00:06:07.920> see<00:06:08.070> what<00:06:08.190> happens<00:06:08.340> anyways<00:06:09.300> I

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
but we'll see what happens anyways I

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.020 
but we'll see what happens anyways I

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
guess that's it with this figure review

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.230 
guess that's it with this figure review
it's<00:06:12.900> not<00:06:13.080> much<00:06:13.320> of<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.530> review<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.940> figure

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240
