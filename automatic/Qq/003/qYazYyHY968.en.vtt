00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
before I start the video I just want to

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.740 
before I start the video I just want to
say<00:00:17.860> that<00:00:18.340> Juggernog<00:00:19.030> is<00:00:19.270> going<00:00:19.540> to<00:00:19.660> be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
say that Juggernog is going to be

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.359 
say that Juggernog is going to be
excluded<00:00:20.260> from<00:00:20.560> this<00:00:20.800> list<00:00:21.130> because

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
excluded from this list because

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.670 
excluded from this list because
Juggernog<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.539> absolutely<00:00:23.170> insane<00:00:23.619> and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
Juggernog is absolutely insane and

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.250 
Juggernog is absolutely insane and
everyone<00:00:24.430> always<00:00:24.699> uses<00:00:25.449> Juggernog<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.230> I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
everyone always uses Juggernog so I

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.750 
everyone always uses Juggernog so I
don't<00:00:26.650> think<00:00:26.859> it<00:00:26.949> would<00:00:27.070> be<00:00:27.130> appropriate<00:00:27.429> to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
don't think it would be appropriate to

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.640 
don't think it would be appropriate to
put<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.150> in<00:00:28.240> this<00:00:28.390> list<00:00:28.720> but<00:00:28.990> if<00:00:29.080> I<00:00:29.199> were<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.410> put

put it in this list but if I were to put

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.919 
put it in this list but if I were to put
it<00:00:29.769> in<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.340> list<00:00:30.550> all<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.269> guys<00:00:31.420> know<00:00:31.689> it
