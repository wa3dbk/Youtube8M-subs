it's<00:04:14.199> not<00:04:14.319> our<00:04:14.379> connections<00:04:14.949> personally<00:04:15.400> just

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
it's not our connections personally just

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.500 
it's not our connections personally just
because<00:04:15.669> whatever<00:04:16.599> we<00:04:16.840> play<00:04:17.019> by<00:04:17.169> ourselves<00:04:18.510> we

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
because whatever we play by ourselves we

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.210 
because whatever we play by ourselves we
have<00:04:19.660> full<00:04:19.900> bars<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.470> we<00:04:20.680> could<00:04:20.829> play<00:04:20.949> just

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
have full bars and we could play just

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.290 
have full bars and we could play just
fine<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.549> whenever<00:04:21.699> we<00:04:21.940> play<00:04:22.060> with<00:04:22.240> each

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
fine but whenever we play with each

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.990 
fine but whenever we play with each
other<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:23.380> other<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.620> other<00:04:23.830> person<00:04:24.400> doesn't

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
other the other the other person doesn't

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.080 
other the other the other person doesn't
do<00:04:25.270> well<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.289> likes<00:04:26.560> for<00:04:27.250> them<00:04:27.400> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
do well and it likes for them and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.210 
do well and it likes for them and
it<00:04:30.080> doesn't<00:04:30.440> it's<00:04:30.590> not<00:04:30.650> our<00:04:30.830> connection<00:04:31.190> is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
it doesn't it's not our connection is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.250 
it doesn't it's not our connection is
just<00:04:31.400> because<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:31.880> does<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.630> when<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.080> play

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
just because it does it when we play

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.230 
just because it does it when we play
modern<00:04:33.590> warfare<00:04:33.620> 2<00:04:34.130> or<00:04:34.400> when<00:04:34.760> we<00:04:34.880> did<00:04:35.060> play

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
modern warfare 2 or when we did play

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.390 
modern warfare 2 or when we did play
modern<00:04:35.570> warfare<00:04:35.600> not<00:04:36.110> 23<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:38.330> had<00:04:38.449> no<00:04:38.540> problems

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
modern warfare not 23 we had no problems

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.689 
modern warfare not 23 we had no problems
but<00:04:40.400> when<00:04:40.820> this<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:42.320> don't<00:04:43.130> know<00:04:43.220> it's<00:04:43.580> just

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
but when this I don't know it's just

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.210 
but when this I don't know it's just
it's<00:04:44.270> kind<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:44.540> annoying<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.350> it's<00:04:46.010> almost

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
it's kind of annoying and it's almost

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.100 
it's kind of annoying and it's almost
been<00:04:46.430> three<00:04:46.790> weeks<00:04:46.820> now<00:04:47.300> since<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:47.840> game<00:04:48.050> has

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
been three weeks now since this game has

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.620 
been three weeks now since this game has
been<00:04:48.680> released<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.669> I<00:04:50.000> know<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.150> treyarch

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
been released and I know a treyarch

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.250 
been released and I know a treyarch
tried<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.680> fix<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.979> initially<00:04:52.699> um<00:04:53.120> but<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:54.110> is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
tried to fix it initially um but this is

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.490 
tried to fix it initially um but this is
um<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.130> just<00:04:55.280> ridiculous<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:57.440> have

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
um this is just ridiculous I would have

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.439 
um this is just ridiculous I would have
thought<00:04:57.560> they<00:04:58.040> would<00:04:58.070> have<00:04:58.310> mortal<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.970> little

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
thought they would have mortal a little

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.570 
thought they would have mortal a little
bit<00:04:59.540> harder<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.080> have<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.800> release<00:05:01.220> by<00:05:01.430> now

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
bit harder to have a release by now

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.070 
bit harder to have a release by now
patch<00:05:02.270> 1.04<00:05:03.110> I'm<00:05:03.590> still<00:05:04.070> waiting<00:05:04.340> for<00:05:04.370> that

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
and until they release that patch I

don't<00:05:29.330> know<00:05:29.539> but<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.669> know<00:05:31.669> it's<00:05:32.240> been<00:05:32.449> it's

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
don't know but you know it's been it's

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.659 
don't know but you know it's been it's
been<00:05:32.840> six<00:05:33.260> years<00:05:33.350> now<00:05:33.620> since<00:05:33.800> this<00:05:34.190> game<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.639> uh

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
been six years now since this game is uh

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.610 
been six years now since this game is uh
since<00:05:35.570> these<00:05:35.690> call<00:05:35.930> duty<00:05:36.139> games<00:05:36.380> have<00:05:36.530> been

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
since these call duty games have been

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.150 
since these call duty games have been
released<00:05:37.000> annually<00:05:38.000> six<00:05:38.720> years<00:05:39.139> you<00:05:39.830> think

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
released annually six years you think

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.060 
released annually six years you think
they<00:05:40.310> figured<00:05:40.850> figured<00:05:41.660> this<00:05:41.810> out<00:05:41.990> like<00:05:42.710> you

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
they figured figured this out like you

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.440 
they figured figured this out like you
think<00:05:43.280> they<00:05:43.370> would<00:05:43.520> have<00:05:43.610> ironed<00:05:43.940> out<00:05:44.030> all<00:05:44.240> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
think they would have ironed out all the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.390 
think they would have ironed out all the
problems<00:05:44.840> in<00:05:44.990> all<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.590> connectivity<00:05:45.950> issues

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
problems in all the connectivity issues

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.909 
problems in all the connectivity issues
and<00:05:46.550> all<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.960> like<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:48.050> don't<00:05:48.289> I<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.650> don't
