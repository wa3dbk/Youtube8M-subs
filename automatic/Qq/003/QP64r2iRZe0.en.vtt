00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.210
 there are certain different that is very 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.799
 important that the client understands the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.709
 time to look at these vehicles on 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.990
 Hybrid vehicle allows you to use part 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.850
 from the battery and after but always use 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.740
 the engine or the engine is always 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.660
 turned on at any time of just 30 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.039
 the vehicle just turn it off 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.839
 always it is going to happen simply 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.279
 book uses part of the battery to 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.929
 certain conditions such as for example 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.119
 when the vehicle is starting up 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.160
 be the electric vehicle does not have a 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.270
 any gasoline engine simply uses 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.280
 the battery to move the wheels and 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.710
 times in all the majority of vehicles 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.539
 nowadays the vehicle uses the brakes 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.059
 to regenerate energy for the battery 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.280
 an extended reach vehicle like the 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.460
 air the perfect combination of both of 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.100
 both worlds has the power of 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.910
 battery but we know that many customers 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.320
 nowadays they are anxious about the right of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.400
 that barely ends the battery like that 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.340
 heath 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.530
 lr you have the advantage that you barely 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.850
 just battery electric generator 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 that is inside the vehicle and regenerates 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.590
 charge so that the battery stays 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.360
 operate operates with gasoline that is 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.280
 when the vehicle runs out of gas 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.470
 and load you can go to any 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.120
 service station refill the tank 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.490
 of fuel with it with fuel 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.260
 in a matter of minutes and continue in your 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 way without any inconvenience without 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.440
 However, we hope that the people who 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 buy an extended reach vehicle 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.240
 as lr use the vehicle most 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.960
 of your time in electric mode the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 vehicle 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.369
 lr also has LED lights is the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.700
 first kyle they come in occupy you have these 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.630
 lights allow you to have more more brightness and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 plus 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.979
 energy efficiency the vehicle 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 it also has active suspension this 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.760
 means that the vehicle every two 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.190
 milliseconds fits the conditions 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.860
 of the land and the pavement that 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.070
 Find to offer an experience 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.350
 optimal to the driver 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 I can also mention that read read 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.030
 compared to bold has enough 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.130
 advantages inside the cabin itself the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.910
 system that looks for the here are issued are 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 allows the person you use to command the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.230
 vehicle to do certain things like 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.209
 turn up the volume or have access to maps 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.040
 touching the 8-inch screen that 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.810
 basically use as you use I had 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.820
 an iphone or an ipad that you can find 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.600
 In any store we can also 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.950
 say that this vehicle will include you 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.770
 state-of-the-art technology that our 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.709
 ats and vehicles such as xps 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.570
 abandonment of lane is like this 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.940
 vehicle alerts you 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.620
 with a noise and also with a vibration 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.020
 in the driver's chair that is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.480
 hanging around leaving your alert lane 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.100
 that has a frontal collision and how 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.810
 option we will have collision alert 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.120
 side that this can be very useful 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.459
 when by company leaving one of the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.190
 mark of hey if you can not see what's next 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.260
 some vehicle l the warning erte that goes to 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.950
 have a collision we also have like 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.840
 option in the lr we can talk about this 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.910
 vehicle will have speed control 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.010
 active 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.150
 at any speed as you can see 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.320
 those are certain examples that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.160
 they differ when coming back and we know that 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.290
 deficient are vehicles completely 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.180
 different the vehicle will have cameras 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.330
 so that when you're in traversa you can 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 see what is happening and you can also 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.350
 help park in reverse too 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 this vehicle will have navigation 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.330
 available I do not know if it will be available in 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.740
 20 will be available in Mexico although the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.010
 vehicle will stop the navigation as 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.570
 standard option and also allows you 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.340
 you have bluetooth to access your 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.010
 phone you connect the phone to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 system that we can also say that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.180
 under the screen of which there is a 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.890
 compartment that allows you to save your 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
 phone and connect it to a usb port 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.120
 to load it, so in theory you 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.680
 you can never have to see your 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720
 phone and you can activate it without any 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 inconvenience that allows you to have a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.470
 much safer experience at the time 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 to drive another thing I can say to the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.800
 respect is that this vehicle will come with 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.690
 10 speakers bous with getting 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.280
 active cancellation technology that you 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.040
 lets have a much more experience 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.810
 comfortable and silent at the time of 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.520
 driving the great advantages of a 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.450
 electric vehicle is that the torque that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.800
 you get 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 when driving the vehicle is 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.630
 instantaneous or that you just 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.730
 accelerate the vehicle will have all the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.650
 power available as soon as you 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.270
 require this is not something that many 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.610
 sports cars is to say today 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.130
 for example a bmw m-3 that has my 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.630
 engine than the one that the lr has to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.340
 expect to reach a certain religion of 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.639
 engine and speed to have access to 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.850
 that tournament with the air 'you have that 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.470
 power at your disposal to penalties you 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.760
 accelerate also as this vehicle is 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.530
 electrical and does not require a box of 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.000
 traditional changes you have a 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.620
 uninterrupted experience for 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.300
 get to the speed you want the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.510
 board as you can see is a screen 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.000
 8 inch high definition 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.740
 this workshop allows you to have four 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.060
 new configurables depending on what 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.950
 that the client wants to see we have 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.479
 options that are quite technical 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.520
 we have options that are simply 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.800
 clean and we have a standard option 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.419
 another feature of this vehicle that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.310
 not many vehicles have in this 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.470
 moment in the market is the possibility 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.330
 to regenerate energy to the battery at 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.520
 time to drive the vehicles 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.020
 electric today they have brakes that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.750
 allow to regenerate the charge the battery 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.090
 for this one 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.130
 but this requires that this vehicle is 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.800
 just use the brakes because it changes 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.050
 a different way with which you can 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.340
 use this feature without any 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.840
 independent drawback 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.330
 regardless of the way you 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.750
 this is activated by pulling on the 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.730
 blades which reduces the speed up 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.380
 that the client wishes because 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.080
 Esteve of this speed reduction 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.660
 It can be quite aggressive depending 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.760
 of the level of axes generated the light of 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.020
 brake will come on to alert the 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.580
 people who delegated him is 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.700
 reducing their speed they should 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.830
 brake accordingly this car will be 100% 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.200
 available at the beginning of 2014 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.910
 the convert concept of 2009 was the 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.180
 concept this is already a vehicle of 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.180
 production
