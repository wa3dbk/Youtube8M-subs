training<00:04:53.930> in<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.800> future<00:04:55.479> somewhat<00:04:56.479> easier

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
training in the future somewhat easier

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
training in the future somewhat easier
because<00:04:56.930> he's<00:04:57.260> gonna<00:04:57.380> be<00:04:57.500> used<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
because he's gonna be used to the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.070 
because he's gonna be used to the
process<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:59.060> again<00:04:59.330> anything<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.930> can
