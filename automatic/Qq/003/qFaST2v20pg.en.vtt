a work of art so guys here's how you use
rust-oleum<00:03:13.070> never<00:03:13.459> went<00:03:13.670> right<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.570> have

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
rust-oleum never went right so you have

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.289 
rust-oleum never went right so you have
two<00:03:15.080> different<00:03:15.590> steps<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:16.580> first<00:03:16.730> step<00:03:16.910> which

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
two different steps the first step which

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.870 
two different steps the first step which
is<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.480> base<00:03:17.720> coat<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:18.290> want<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.340> spray<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.610> so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
is a base coat you want to spray and so

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.940 
is a base coat you want to spray and so
on<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.630> at<00:03:20.930> least<00:03:21.260> 30<00:03:21.560> minutes<00:03:21.680> before

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
on with at least 30 minutes before

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.130 
on with at least 30 minutes before
spearing<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.549> second<00:03:22.910> coat<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.750> again

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
spearing a second coat and again

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.130 
spearing a second coat and again
obviously<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:25.040> second

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
obviously a second

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
obviously a second
right<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.340> then<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.820> go<00:03:27.970> on<00:03:28.060> with<00:03:28.090> step

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
right and then you can go on with step

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.900 
right and then you can go on with step
