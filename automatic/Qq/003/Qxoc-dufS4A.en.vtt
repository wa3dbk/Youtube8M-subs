00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
2016 I mean in all my playing of the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.650 
2016 I mean in all my playing of the
ARMA<00:03:15.610> games<00:03:15.640> have<00:03:15.940> always<00:03:16.060> felt<00:03:16.269> like<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
ARMA games have always felt like the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.319 
ARMA games have always felt like the
terrain<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.680> most<00:03:18.489> important<00:03:18.849> characters

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
terrain is the most important characters

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.210 
terrain is the most important characters
of<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.870> game<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.380> mean<00:03:20.530> we<00:03:20.860> already<00:03:21.069> see

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
of the game and I mean we already see

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.250 
of the game and I mean we already see
some<00:03:21.370> architecture<00:03:21.970> that's<00:03:22.150> not<00:03:23.079> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
some architecture that's not really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.020 
some architecture that's not really
found<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.890> rest<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.280> game<00:03:24.430> yeah

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
found in the rest of the game yeah

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.089 
found in the rest of the game yeah
exactly<00:03:25.180> i<00:03:25.540> think<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.019> setting<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.709> something

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
exactly i think the setting is something

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.710 
exactly i think the setting is something
really<00:03:27.340> fresh<00:03:27.579> for<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.849> armor<00:03:28.150> series<00:03:28.360> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720

a<00:03:33.010> green<00:03:33.400> hell<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.690> bit<00:03:34.810> more<00:03:34.959> role<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
a green hell so it's a bit more role and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.559 
a green hell so it's a bit more role and
more<00:03:35.769> gritty<00:03:36.099> than<00:03:36.400> your<00:03:36.549> typical<00:03:36.730> holiday

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
more gritty than your typical holiday

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.390 
more gritty than your typical holiday
resort<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.440> i'm<00:03:38.620> really<00:03:38.769> looking<00:03:38.950> forward<00:03:39.370> to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
resort and i'm really looking forward to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.580 
resort and i'm really looking forward to
I<00:03:39.880> would<00:03:40.450> making<00:03:40.780> some<00:03:40.959> cool<00:03:41.110> military

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
I would making some cool military

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.800 
I would making some cool military
scenarios<00:03:42.250> in<00:03:42.400> there<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.299> mean<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.450> also<00:03:43.540> saw

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
scenarios in there and I mean I also saw

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.300 
scenarios in there and I mean I also saw
that<00:03:43.840> islands<00:03:44.350> seem<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.620> be<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> pretty<00:03:44.950> central

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
that islands seem to be a pretty central

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.860 
that islands seem to be a pretty central
component<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.120> mean<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.450> this<00:03:46.569> going

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
component to that I mean is this going

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.050 
component to that I mean is this going
to<00:03:46.930> change<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.590> way<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.910> movement

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
to change the way that the movement

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.090 
to change the way that the movement
works<00:03:49.329> for<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.540> player<00:03:49.769> well<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:50.920> certainly

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
works for the player well it's certainly

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.770 
works for the player well it's certainly
something<00:03:51.280> new<00:03:51.730> for<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.150> for<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.569> armor

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
something new for the for the armor

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.080 
something new for the for the armor
series<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:54.010> mean<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.370> think<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.670> all<00:03:54.940> of

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
series and I mean I think like all of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.520 
series and I mean I think like all of
the<00:03:55.209> terrains<00:03:55.540> which<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:56.019> been<00:03:56.170> such<00:03:56.500> a

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the terrains which have been such a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.170 
the terrains which have been such a
massive<00:03:56.829> part<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.370> all<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> games<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
massive part of all of the games that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.849 
massive part of all of the games that
we've<00:03:58.359> made<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.780> last<00:03:58.959> 15<00:03:59.380> years<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
we've made for the last 15 years the

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.629 
we've made for the last 15 years the
generous<00:04:00.280> at<00:04:00.430> altus<00:04:00.819> and<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.810> tanoa<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.829> core

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
generous at altus and now tanoa the core

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.069 
generous at altus and now tanoa the core
experience<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.420> same<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.930> it's<00:04:05.049> a

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
experience is the same you know it's a

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.340 
experience is the same you know it's a
richly<00:04:05.530> detailed<00:04:05.680> kind<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.400> authentic<00:04:06.970> world

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
richly detailed kind of authentic world

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.539 
richly detailed kind of authentic world
but<00:04:08.350> definitely<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:09.010> islands<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
but definitely the islands the

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.460 
but definitely the islands the
archipelago<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.329> it's<00:04:10.660> something<00:04:10.989> new<00:04:11.170> it

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
archipelago it's it's something new it

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.190 
archipelago it's it's something new it
means<00:04:11.799> exploring<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.120> islands<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.660> little<00:04:14.079> bit

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
means exploring the islands a little bit

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.400 
means exploring the islands a little bit
differently<00:04:15.419> maybe<00:04:16.419> on<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.750> water<00:04:16.959> is<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.229> bit

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
differently maybe on the water is a bit

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.990 
differently maybe on the water is a bit
more<00:04:17.560> important<00:04:17.950> this<00:04:18.010> time<00:04:18.070> underwater<00:04:18.609> as

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
more important this time underwater as

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.940 
more important this time underwater as
well<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.450> yeah<00:04:20.139> I'm<00:04:20.260> looking<00:04:20.620> forward<00:04:20.769> to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
well and yeah I'm looking forward to

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.260 
well and yeah I'm looking forward to
putting<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.459> in<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> players<00:04:21.849> hands<00:04:22.060> and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
putting it in the players hands and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.790 
putting it in the players hands and
seeing<00:04:22.539> how<00:04:22.630> they<00:04:22.750> explore<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.500> we<00:04:23.590> talked

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
seeing how they explore it and we talked

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.779 
seeing how they explore it and we talked
about<00:04:23.889> this<00:04:24.039> right<00:04:24.220> before<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.490> came<00:04:24.610> on<00:04:24.669> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
about this right before you came on the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.360 
about this right before you came on the
stage<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:25.389> you<00:04:25.990> guys<00:04:26.470> are<00:04:26.620> such<00:04:26.979> huge

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
stage that you guys are such huge

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.969 
stage that you guys are such huge
believers<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.240> modding<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.680> seems<00:04:29.919> like

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
believers in modding and this seems like

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.760 
believers in modding and this seems like
a<00:04:30.099> brand<00:04:30.520> new<00:04:30.580> toy<00:04:30.789> for<00:04:30.820> modders<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.419> play<00:04:31.570> with

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
curious about we've talked about the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.600 
curious about we've talked about the
terrain<00:04:50.650> extensively<00:04:51.160> but<00:04:51.310> what<00:04:51.430> are<00:04:51.520> some

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
terrain extensively but what are some

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.249 
terrain extensively but what are some
the<00:04:51.639> other<00:04:51.789> new<00:04:52.000> features<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.810> gameplay<00:04:53.169> that

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
the other new features and gameplay that

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.170 
the other new features and gameplay that
will<00:04:53.380> be<00:04:53.470> coming<00:04:53.650> along<00:04:53.860> with<00:04:54.009> tanoa<00:04:54.280> well<00:04:55.060> we

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
will be coming along with tanoa well we

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.420 
will be coming along with tanoa well we
definitely<00:04:55.389> know<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.690> we<00:04:55.960> make<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.410> game<00:04:57.250> as<00:04:57.400> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
definitely know that we make a game as a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.460 
definitely know that we make a game as a
platform<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:58.240> we<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.479> our<00:04:58.509> own<00:04:58.630> vision<00:04:59.349> of

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
platform so we have our own vision of

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.400 
platform so we have our own vision of
what<00:04:59.620> ARMA<00:04:59.889> 3<00:05:00.069> is<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:01.419> also<00:05:01.539> have<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:02.319> think

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
what ARMA 3 is and we also have to think

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.439 
what ARMA 3 is and we also have to think
about<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.740> models<00:05:03.069> so<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.970> features<00:05:04.419> that

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
about the models so the features that

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.029 
about the models so the features that
were<00:05:04.690> bringing<00:05:05.020> along<00:05:05.199> like<00:05:05.380> we<00:05:05.410> see<00:05:05.710> some<00:05:06.009> of

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
were bringing along like we see some of

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.800 
were bringing along like we see some of
the<00:05:06.190> screens<00:05:06.550> place<00:05:06.729> reflections<00:05:07.330> we<00:05:07.569> see<00:05:07.690> the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810
