side<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.490> have<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.729> better<00:04:38.910> front<00:04:39.150> end<00:04:39.360> and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
side so I have the better front end and

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.680 
side so I have the better front end and
then<00:04:41.580> I'll<00:04:41.700> take<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.150> rear<00:04:42.330> end<00:04:42.510> off<00:04:42.660> of

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
then I'll take the rear end off of

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.740 
then I'll take the rear end off of
course<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.350> oh<00:04:43.979> by<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.190> way<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:46.440> got<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
course and oh by the way it's got the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.969 
course and oh by the way it's got the
Spicer<00:04:48.750> logo<00:04:49.139> on<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.560> don't<00:04:49.620> know<00:04:49.770> what

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
Spicer logo on it I don't know what

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.740 
Spicer logo on it I don't know what
model<00:04:50.160> number<00:04:50.520> this<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.880> yet<00:04:51.120> but<00:04:51.360> that's<00:04:51.630> a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
model number this is yet but that's a

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.520 
model number this is yet but that's a
really<00:04:52.169> big<00:04:52.530> heavy-duty<00:04:52.979> looking<00:04:53.460> rear<00:04:53.669> end

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
really big heavy-duty looking rear end

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.770 
really big heavy-duty looking rear end
so<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.950> think<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.850> think<00:04:56.970> Russa<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.479> going<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.690> be

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
so I think I think Russa is going to be

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.490 
so I think I think Russa is going to be
set<00:04:58.020> for<00:04:58.460> rear<00:04:59.460> end<00:04:59.640> wise<00:05:00.140> she'd<00:05:01.140> be<00:05:01.229> getting<00:05:01.350> a

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
set for rear end wise she'd be getting a

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.159 
set for rear end wise she'd be getting a
good<00:05:01.620> one<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:02.360> won't<00:05:03.360> know<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.600> model<00:05:03.900> number

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
good one I won't know the model number

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.010 
good one I won't know the model number
though<00:05:04.289> until<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.620> get<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:05.340> off<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.789> get<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
though until I get it off and get that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.430 
though until I get it off and get that
pulley<00:05:07.020> off<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.800> taking<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.039> all<00:05:08.160> apart

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
pulley off of it and taking it all apart

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.040 
pulley off of it and taking it all apart
that<00:05:10.440> pulley<00:05:10.710> by<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:10.950> way<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> measured<00:05:11.700> it

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
that pulley by the way I measured it

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.750 
that pulley by the way I measured it
it's<00:05:13.050> ten<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.620> half<00:05:13.830> inches<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.610> I'm

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
it's ten and a half inches so I'm

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.250 
it's ten and a half inches so I'm
thinking<00:05:15.150> if<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.360> go<00:05:16.010> half<00:05:17.010> on<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.340> say<00:05:18.260> six

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
thinking if I go half on it say six

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.920 
thinking if I go half on it say six
maybe<00:05:20.070> six<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.520> half<00:05:20.550> five<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.270> think

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
maybe six and a half five I think

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.300 
maybe six and a half five I think
that'll<00:05:22.139> get<00:05:22.260> me<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.470> speed<00:05:22.680> I'm<00:05:22.860> wanting<00:05:23.190> and

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
that'll get me the speed I'm wanting and

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.560 
that'll get me the speed I'm wanting and
still<00:05:23.460> have<00:05:23.610> plenty<00:05:23.639> of<00:05:23.940> torque<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.419> I<00:05:24.450> think

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
still have plenty of torque so I think

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.290 
still have plenty of torque so I think
that's<00:05:25.229> pretty<00:05:25.380> much<00:05:25.500> what<00:05:25.740> I'm<00:05:25.830> going<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:25.979> do

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
that's pretty much what I'm going to do

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.850 
that's pretty much what I'm going to do
pulley<00:05:27.300> wise<00:05:29.000> all<00:05:30.000> right

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
pulley wise all right

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.089 
pulley wise all right
remember<00:05:32.550> safety<00:05:32.939> first<00:05:33.680> got<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.830> taking<00:05:35.039> my

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
remember safety first got to taking my

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.540 
remember safety first got to taking my
eyes<00:05:35.280> they're<00:05:35.580> already<00:05:35.759> bad<00:05:35.969> enough<00:05:35.999> as<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.360> is

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
eyes they're already bad enough as it is

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.360 
eyes they're already bad enough as it is
alright<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.849> got<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.509> front<00:05:40.259> axle<00:05:40.680> out<00:05:40.860> all

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
alright I got the front axle out all

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.390 
alright I got the front axle out all
that's<00:05:41.610> left<00:05:41.819> is<00:05:41.939> the<00:05:42.060> axle<00:05:42.389> carrier<00:05:42.749> I<00:05:43.249> use<00:05:44.249> my

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
that's left is the axle carrier I use my

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.689 
that's left is the axle carrier I use my
sawzall<00:05:44.879> here<00:05:45.469> and<00:05:46.469> I'll<00:05:46.680> just<00:05:46.800> saw<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.520> all
