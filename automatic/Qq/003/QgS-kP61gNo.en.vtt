they<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.970> bulbous<00:01:09.600> portion<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
they have a bulbous portion and that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240 
they have a bulbous portion and that
truly<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> bulb<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.259> flower<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
truly is the bulb of the flower when

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
truly is the bulb of the flower when
they<00:01:14.460> harvest<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.840> leave<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> portion

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
they harvest these they leave a portion

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.040 
they harvest these they leave a portion
of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> bulb<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.340> core<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.930> it's

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
of the bulb on core it out a bit so it's

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.770 
of the bulb on core it out a bit so it's
not<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.229> great<00:01:19.619> big<00:01:19.950> orb<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.000> he's<00:01:21.360> there

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
not that great big orb but he's there

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
not that great big orb but he's there
you<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.640> cut<00:01:23.880> off<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.420> basal

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you don't want to cut off the basal

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.650 
you don't want to cut off the basal
plate<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.740> base<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.300> leave

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
plate the base of this you want to leave

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.950 
plate the base of this you want to leave
that<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.920> concerns<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.660> think<00:01:30.840> oh

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that if it concerns you and you think oh

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
that if it concerns you and you think oh
I<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.410> be<00:01:31.500> able<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.649> drink<00:01:31.830> better<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
I want it to be able to drink better you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.870 
I want it to be able to drink better you
could<00:01:32.759> scrape<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:34.050> small<00:01:34.530> amount<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
could scrape a very small amount off but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.430 
could scrape a very small amount off but
it's<00:01:36.000> important<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> leave<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> basal<00:01:37.229> plate

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
it's important to leave the basal plate

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.520 
it's important to leave the basal plate
on<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> has<00:01:38.700> food<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.840> nutrition

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
on because that has food the nutrition

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
on because that has food the nutrition
for<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.220> bloom<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.270> once<00:01:42.659> you've<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
for the bloom then once you've got it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
for the bloom then once you've got it
opened<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.549> ahead<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.270> into<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
opened out go ahead and set it into a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
opened out go ahead and set it into a
bucket<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.080> water<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> dirt<00:01:47.400> can<00:01:47.610> start

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
bucket of water so the dirt can start

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
bucket of water so the dirt can start
getting<00:01:48.060> washed<00:01:48.420> off<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.830> tiny

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
getting washed off again just a tiny

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.240 
getting washed off again just a tiny
tiny<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.820> bit<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.510> then<00:01:52.170> set<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> down<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
tiny little bit and then set it down in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
tiny little bit and then set it down in
now<00:01:53.729> I've<00:01:53.850> added<00:01:54.119> flower<00:01:54.690> food<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.260> my<00:01:55.380> water

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
now I've added flower food to my water

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340 
now I've added flower food to my water
because<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.880> hold<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:58.080> better

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
because they will hold much much better

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.890 
because they will hold much much better
with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> flower<00:01:59.159> food<00:01:59.490> again<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> tiny

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
with the flower food again just a tiny

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.950 
with the flower food again just a tiny
bit<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.310> reality<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.570> could<00:02:03.750> probably

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
bit and in reality you could probably

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.039 
bit and in reality you could probably
just<00:02:04.290> take<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> set<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.049> because

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
just take them and set them in because

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
just take them and set them in because
the<00:02:07.229> bulb<00:02:07.470> has<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:08.310> nutrition<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.209> needs

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the bulb has the nutrition that it needs

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.500 
the bulb has the nutrition that it needs
so<00:02:09.750> again<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.470> very<00:02:10.560> easy<00:02:11.390> open<00:02:12.390> your

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so again it's very easy open your

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.410 
so again it's very easy open your
package<00:02:17.450> remove<00:02:18.450> loose<00:02:18.900> foliage<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
package remove loose foliage then just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.410 
package remove loose foliage then just
the<00:02:21.870> tiniest<00:02:22.769> scrape<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.790> basal<00:02:24.180> plate

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the tiniest scrape of the basal plate
