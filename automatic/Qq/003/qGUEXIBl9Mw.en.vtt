so we got an f-150 pickup gonna try to
take<00:00:46.640> place<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.120> skidder<00:00:47.360> today<00:00:47.980> we've

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
take place in the skidder today we've

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.329 
take place in the skidder today we've
got<00:00:49.100> 22<00:00:49.519> logs<00:00:50.260> 110,000<00:00:51.260> pounds<00:00:51.410> in<00:00:51.739> total<00:00:51.890> you

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
got 22 logs 110,000 pounds in total you

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.430 
got 22 logs 110,000 pounds in total you
don't<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:53.059> wheel<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.930> just<00:00:53.960> picks

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
don't have a wheel on it it just picks

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.229 
don't have a wheel on it it just picks
it<00:00:54.589> up<00:00:54.710> trying<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.699> get<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.879> end<00:00:55.970> up<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
it up trying to get the end up the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.000 
it up trying to get the end up the
ground<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.720> dragging<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.770> an

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
ground and dragging it so this is an

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.619 
ground and dragging it so this is an
engine<00:00:58.309> that's<00:00:58.430> been<00:00:58.579> through<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.969> lifetime<00:00:59.210> of

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
engine that's been through a lifetime of

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.479 
engine that's been through a lifetime of
work<00:00:59.809> already<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.469> now<00:01:00.739> we've<00:01:01.039> brought<00:01:01.250> it

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
work already and now we've brought it

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.279 
work already and now we've brought it
out<00:01:01.640> here<00:01:01.670> these<00:01:02.239> guys<00:01:02.510> are<00:01:02.570> probably<00:01:02.840> used<00:01:03.199> to

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
out here these guys are probably used to

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.590 
out here these guys are probably used to
using<00:01:03.350> big<00:01:03.829> v8s<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.520> super<00:01:04.879> duties<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.360> think

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
using big v8s and super duties I think

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.940 
using big v8s and super duties I think
they're<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.899> be<00:01:06.050> shocked<00:01:06.350> at<00:01:06.590> how<00:01:06.740> this

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
they're going to be shocked at how this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.910 
they're going to be shocked at how this
this<00:01:07.460> vehicle<00:01:07.910> pulls<00:01:08.149> guys<00:01:08.750> will<00:01:09.140> do<00:01:09.289> it<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:09.649> I

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
this vehicle pulls guys will do it but I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:23.850 
this vehicle pulls guys will do it but I
think<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.490> guys<00:01:10.670> are
