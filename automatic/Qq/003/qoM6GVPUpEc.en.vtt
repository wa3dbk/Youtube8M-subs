obviously<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:05.100> gold<00:00:05.430> doesn't<00:00:05.819> come<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.150> this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
obviously that gold doesn't come in this

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.580 
obviously that gold doesn't come in this
way<00:00:07.820> into<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.000> pan<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
way into one pan but we're going to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.910 
way into one pan but we're going to
sprinkle<00:00:11.030> this<00:00:12.030> gold<00:00:13.250> that<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.519> got

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
sprinkle this gold that we just got

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.250 
sprinkle this gold that we just got
throughout<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.100> turbo<00:00:17.460> pan<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.480> then<00:00:19.140> what

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
throughout that turbo pan and then what

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.800 
throughout that turbo pan and then what
I<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:21.199> hopefully<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:23.630> enough<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
I want to do hopefully this is enough of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.290 
I want to do hopefully this is enough of
an<00:00:24.990> angle<00:00:25.260> gosh<00:00:26.039> maybe<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:29.240> is<00:00:30.240> maybe

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
an angle gosh maybe it's not is maybe

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:43.720 
an angle gosh maybe it's not is maybe
get<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.600> filled<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.469> water

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.910 

and<00:00:44.030> just<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:44.660> that<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:44.900> can<00:00:45.050> see<00:00:45.290> that's<00:00:45.620> all

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and just so that you can see that's all

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.640 
and just so that you can see that's all
gold<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.580> again<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.810> actions<00:00:48.290> that<00:00:48.470> you're

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
gold and again the actions that you're

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.550 
gold and again the actions that you're
doing<00:00:48.830> with<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.280> is<00:00:49.460> you're<00:00:49.610> washing<00:00:49.880> it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
doing with this is you're washing it

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.590 
doing with this is you're washing it
clockwise<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:51.950> that's<00:00:52.730> washing<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:53.390> light

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
clockwise and that's washing that light

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600 
clockwise and that's washing that light
material<00:00:54.200> off<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.740> can<00:00:54.890> see<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.280> Gold's

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
material off you can see that Gold's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.730 
material off you can see that Gold's
kind<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:55.940> stay<00:00:56.150> in<00:00:56.240> there<00:00:56.450> or<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:57.260> stepping

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
kind of stay in there or it's stepping

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.460 
kind of stay in there or it's stepping
down<00:00:57.920> because<00:00:58.430> that's<00:00:58.670> swirling<00:00:59.000> motion<00:00:59.720> it's

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
down because that's swirling motion it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.799 
down because that's swirling motion it's
bringing<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.160> gold<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.550> inside<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.210> then

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
bringing the gold to the inside and then

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.780 
bringing the gold to the inside and then
you're<00:01:02.989> going<00:01:03.080> to<00:01:03.140> do<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.650> motion<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.640> other

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you're going to do a motion the other

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.520 
you're going to do a motion the other
way<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.510> if<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.870> can<00:01:06.020> kind<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.320> watch<00:01:06.470> that

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
way and if you can kind of watch that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.760 
way and if you can kind of watch that
trap<00:01:07.190> right<00:01:07.430> there<00:01:07.990> that's<00:01:08.990> what<00:01:09.200> happens<00:01:09.590> is

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
trap right there that's what happens is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.030 
trap right there that's what happens is
the<00:01:09.950> gold<00:01:10.220> comes<00:01:11.090> off<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.450> those<00:01:11.930> ledges<00:01:12.440> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the gold comes off of those ledges and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.290 
the gold comes off of those ledges and
it<00:01:13.550> goes<00:01:13.760> right<00:01:14.000> down<00:01:14.060> into<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.260> trap<00:01:15.740> and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
it goes right down into that trap and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.660 
it goes right down into that trap and
then<00:01:17.300> you<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:17.600> side<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:17.960> side<00:01:18.380> or<00:01:18.800> front<00:01:19.340> to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
then you go side to side or front to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.290 
then you go side to side or front to
back<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.530> as<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:21.560> go<00:01:21.860> more<00:01:22.130> you'll<00:01:22.910> start<00:01:23.180> to

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
back and as you go more you'll start to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.140 
back and as you go more you'll start to
see<00:01:23.330> more<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.869> more<00:01:23.960> gold<00:01:24.490> into<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.640> trap<00:01:25.940> it

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
see more and more gold into that trap it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.859 
see more and more gold into that trap it
works<00:01:26.360> its<00:01:26.600> way<00:01:26.750> down<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.290> finds<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.310> Nuggets

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
works its way down it finds the Nuggets

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.510 
works its way down it finds the Nuggets
again<00:01:29.869> as<00:01:30.140> you're<00:01:30.320> swirling<00:01:30.890> you're<00:01:31.190> washing

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
again as you're swirling you're washing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.460 
again as you're swirling you're washing
that<00:01:31.910> material<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.660> then<00:01:33.170> you're<00:01:33.320> bringing

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
that material and then you're bringing

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.440 
that material and then you're bringing
it<00:01:33.770> back<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.130> other<00:01:34.280> way<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.729> you're<00:01:35.030> forcing

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
it back the other way and you're forcing

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.580 
it back the other way and you're forcing
that<00:01:35.780> heavy<00:01:36.759> material<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.000> gold<00:01:38.590> through

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
that heavy material and the gold through

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.340 
that heavy material and the gold through
those<00:01:39.800> vents<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.690> down<00:01:41.690> into<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.979> Center

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
those vents and down into that Center

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.469 
those vents and down into that Center
and<00:01:45.350> again<00:01:45.590> back<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.700> forth<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:47.119> couple<00:01:47.149> times

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
and again back and forth a couple times

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.020 
and again back and forth a couple times
side<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.140> side<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.410> couple<00:01:48.619> times<00:01:49.039> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
side to side a couple times and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.650 
side to side a couple times and
hopefully<00:01:50.539> once<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.200> end<00:01:52.660> see

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
hopefully once you get to the end see

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.960 
hopefully once you get to the end see
what<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.289> here<00:01:56.380> okay<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:57.979> far<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
what I have here okay so so far in just

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.340 
what I have here okay so so far in just
those<00:01:59.119> three<00:01:59.330> switches<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.899> only<00:02:00.140> thing<00:02:00.229> that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
those three switches the only thing that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.139 
those three switches the only thing that
didn't<00:02:00.649> get<00:02:00.709> down<00:02:00.920> there<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.759> was<00:02:01.789> almost

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
didn't get down there and it was almost

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.930 
didn't get down there and it was almost
there<00:02:02.420> has<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.929> little<00:02:03.080> flake<00:02:03.610> no<00:02:04.610> where<00:02:04.789> in

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
there has that little flake no where in

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.949 
there has that little flake no where in
the<00:02:05.119> rest<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.630> pan<00:02:05.899> do<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.649> see<00:02:06.860> any<00:02:07.100> gold

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
the rest of the pan do you see any gold

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.030 
the rest of the pan do you see any gold
and<00:02:08.959> again<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:10.369> part<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.940> design

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and again it's just part of the design

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.100 
and again it's just part of the design
that<00:02:13.040> motion<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> swirl<00:02:14.270> these<00:02:14.720> riffles

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that motion in that swirl these riffles

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.160 
that motion in that swirl these riffles
right<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.770> feed<00:02:16.190> into<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.360> trap<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.080> it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
right here feed into this trap and it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.960 
right here feed into this trap and it
washes<00:02:18.709> everything<00:02:18.890> right<00:02:19.310> down<00:02:19.459> into<00:02:19.790> there

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
washes everything right down into there

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.510 
washes everything right down into there
so<00:02:20.300> that's<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.500> turbo<00:02:21.830> man<00:02:22.010> we'll<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.370> more

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
so that's the turbo man we'll have more
