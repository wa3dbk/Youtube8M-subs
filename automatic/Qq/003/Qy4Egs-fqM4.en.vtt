actual display itself and then up here

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
actual display itself and then up here
in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> top<00:00:55.770> you've<00:00:55.980> got<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.219> settings<00:00:56.760> and

in the top you've got these settings and
then<00:00:57.420> he've<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.109> quite<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
then he've actually got quite a lot of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
then he've actually got quite a lot of
things<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.670> you've<00:00:59.789> got<00:00:59.910> lock<00:01:00.149> screen<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
things so you've got lock screen so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
things so you've got lock screen so
again<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.289> disable<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.890> enable<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.609> even

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
again you can disable or enable it even

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.719 
again you can disable or enable it even
also<00:01:03.420> disabled<00:01:03.930> during<00:01:04.199> inactive<00:01:05.010> periods<00:01:05.549> as

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
also disabled during inactive periods as

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.550 
also disabled during inactive periods as
well<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.600> sometimes<00:01:07.020> use<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> bit

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
well because it can sometimes use a bit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
well because it can sometimes use a bit
of<00:01:07.650> battery<00:01:08.100> you've<00:01:08.640> also<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:09.030> activate<00:01:09.479> mode

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
of battery you've also got activate mode

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
of battery you've also got activate mode
and<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.290> basically<00:01:10.380> show<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> one

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and this would basically show you one

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
and this would basically show you one
it's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> activate<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:13.320> pocket<00:01:13.740> or

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's going to activate in your pocket or

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's going to activate in your pocket or
if<00:01:14.070> you're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> picking<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.030> off

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
if you're going to be picking it up off

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
if you're going to be picking it up off
of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.600> table<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.680> basically

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
of the table and what this basically

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
of the table and what this basically
does<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.759> turn<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
does is if you turn this on and you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
does is if you turn this on and you
actually<00:01:18.930> move<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.170> device<00:01:19.409> around<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.159> if

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
notifications that you may have you've
also<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> actual<00:01:28.890> notifications

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
also think of the actual notifications

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
also think of the actual notifications
themselves<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.689> borrow<00:01:31.020> heavily<00:01:31.259> from

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
themselves and these borrow heavily from

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
themselves and these borrow heavily from
the<00:01:31.770> lollipop<00:01:32.400> feature<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.030> priority

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the lollipop feature of priority

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.539 
the lollipop feature of priority
notifications<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.040> set<00:01:35.280> certain

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
notifications so you can set certain

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
notifications so you can set certain
things<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> show<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.540> show<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.680> when

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
things to show and not show as and when

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
things to show and not show as and when
you<00:01:37.979> need<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> interface<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you need you then go the interface and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
you need you then go the interface and
again<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.680> add<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> ton<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> different

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
again you can add a ton of different

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
again you can add a ton of different
things<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.090> including<00:01:42.600> wallpapers

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
things here including wallpapers

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
things here including wallpapers
backgrounds<00:01:43.979> changing<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.729> size<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
backgrounds changing that so size of the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
backgrounds changing that so size of the
notification<00:01:46.409> icons<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.549> also<00:01:47.820> change

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
notification icons you can also change

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
notification icons you can also change
certain<00:01:48.659> things<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.079> overriding<00:01:49.740> system

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
certain things like overriding system

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800 
certain things like overriding system
fonts<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> actual<00:01:50.970> Apple<00:01:51.240> users<00:01:51.630> own

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
fonts so the actual Apple users own

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
fonts so the actual Apple users own
fonts<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> you've<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> circle

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939

showed with the start with the material
design<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.380> change<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.490> if

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
design you can change all of that so if

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.249 
design you can change all of that so if
I<00:01:59.670> change<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> circle<00:02:00.600> color<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.079> for

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I change the circle color to for

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
I change the circle color to for

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
whereas at the start I had white and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.800 
whereas at the start I had white and
blue<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.209> again<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.660> some

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
blue so again there is some

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
there the actual lockscreen itself isn't

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.949 
there the actual lockscreen itself isn't
always<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.610> hundred<00:02:39.120> percent<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.599> terms<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
always a hundred percent in terms of

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.869 
always a hundred percent in terms of
actually<00:02:40.230> activating<00:02:40.980> which<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.610> one<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
actually activating which is one of the

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.890 
actually activating which is one of the
problems<00:02:42.150> I've<00:02:42.239> found<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.660> many

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
problems I've found with many

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.839 
problems I've found with many
third-party<00:02:43.230> lock<00:02:43.799> screens<00:02:44.129> they<00:02:44.610> just

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
third-party lock screens they just

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.059 
third-party lock screens they just
sometimes<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.540> work<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.530> kick<00:02:46.920> in

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
sometimes don't work they do kick in

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.559 
sometimes don't work they do kick in
eventually<00:02:47.579> but<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.849> can<00:02:48.060> sometimes<00:02:48.269> take

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
eventually but it can sometimes take

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.479 
eventually but it can sometimes take
some<00:02:48.900> time<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.650> isn't<00:02:49.860> necessarily<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
some time which isn't necessarily the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.160 
some time which isn't necessarily the
best<00:02:50.670> thing<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:51.000> terms<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.360> security<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:52.110> terms

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
best thing in terms of security in terms

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.350 
best thing in terms of security in terms
of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.920> applications<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:53.670> well<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> see

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
