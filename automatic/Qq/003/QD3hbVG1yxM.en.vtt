00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.220
 Here is the setup. I have a scale and two identical cups, which I fill with exactly 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.580
 the same amount of water, but in one of the cups is a submerged table tennis ball 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.630
 with a wire attached to the bottom of the cup. And in the other glass there is a ball of the same size 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.910
 but made of acrylic. So it has a higher density than water and is held up by a thread. 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.050
 Now I want you to make a prediction. If I let go of this scale and him 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.060
 free balance, which way do you think it will go, to the acrylic ball, to 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.400
 the ping-pong ball or would it remain perfectly balanced? You can make your choice by clicking 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.740
 clicking on one of the buttons on the screen or a link in the description. 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.840
 "If they both move the same amount, I don't think he will run. So, yes, 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.000
 he won't turn. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 Stay in balance. " 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.920
 "The ping-pong ball has mass, although it is not very much. I would predict this side 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.140
 will sink. " 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.750
 "I almost feel that this side will come up because it is lighter than ... but 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.049
 it cannot pull because it hangs on the rod. I do not know." 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.909
 "I think it's going this way. I think because of the tension that 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 this accelerates. " 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.289
 "So I guess if you add all the forces together, this one is more. So then this one goes 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.030
 up. No ... OK. So I change my mind. I'm going for this one 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.240
 will float. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 "But, I mean, it seems that this would not contribute force on this side, because it is fixed 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.419
 and the forces are in balance. " 

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:31.280
 "That means that you have more normal power here and that it is heading this way." 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.859
 He's going down on the ping-pong ball side? 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.189
 "Yes, certainly the side of the ping pong ball." 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 "Yes. That's so strange." 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:47.179
 So now you think this side goes up and this side goes down. 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:58.209
 Are you ready for it? Three two one.
