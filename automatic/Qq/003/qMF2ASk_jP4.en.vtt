00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.210
 This time we will talk about the metabolism of lipids 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.439
 remember that they were lipids 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.450
 the lipids are also known as fatty acids 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.659
 and within its classification we can say that there are simple and compound 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.699
 The simplest way to express lipids is the form of acids 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.310
 fatty 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 now we will talk about the metabolism of fatty acids 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.949
 like the previous presentation it is important for me to know how to 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 they are called their routes 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090
 where they are made and how important they are 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.230
 but I will not detail the reactions nor the enzymes that intervene in each 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.040
 one of them 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.580
 the anabolic phase of lipids today in this case of fatty acids is known 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.380
 as synthesis or biosynthesis of fatty acids 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.610
 where they are produced in the mitochondrial matrix 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.289
 the catabolic phase known as beta oxidation 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.150
 they take place in the cytoplasm 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.130
 now we can see in anabolism is an addition of units 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.580
 repetitive carbon 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.910
 whereas catabolism consists in the elimination of carbon units from 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.660
 the hydrocarbon chain 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.750
 because we are talking about hydrocarbon chains or carbon chains in this case 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.850
 remember that fatty acids or lipids are formed by 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 long chains of carbohydrates this means that in your structure one goes to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.490
 have carbon 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.570
 hydrogen 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.530
 some will differentiate because they have phospholipids 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.870
 or have simple or double links 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.310
 what can differentiate them 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.160
 but in itself generally within its structure are formed by carbon and hydrogen 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.680
 and they are long chains 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 hydrocarbons 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.720
 this graph represents general form 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.350
 the catabolic phase versus the anabolic face 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.189
 catabolic as beta oxidation that the mitochondria and the phase are performed 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.500
 anabolic known as fatty acid biosynthesis 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.830
 and it occurs in the cytoplasm 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.979
 as we can see in the two phases here 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.069
 one is inverse to the other 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.649
 we start from the coenzyme citel 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:13.980
 and in this case 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.050
 uses a carbon carrier known as 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.839
 asylums or ACP 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.509
 the final phase will be cetyl coenzyme A 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.519
 with certain carbon chains 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.620
 while in the biosynthesis phase 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.579
 part 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.759
 of acyl with the presence of carbons carried if then by this 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.380
 reason that the anabolism of fatty acids 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.299
 is inverse to the catabolic phase of fatty acids 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.849
 we can see what reactions occur in each of its phases and 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.099
 as well 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.039
 what holm oaks are involved each of them 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.279
 both in the catabolic phase and the anabolic phase 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.189
 like some cofactors which products are made or which product is obtained 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.270
 that will form 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.539
 And everything else 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:06.289
 then let's talk separately the catabolic phase and the phase 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.249
 anabolic 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.570
 the catabolic phase 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.049
 betaocidation 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.599
 as we see in the graph 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.119
 consists of a cycle 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.870
 which is the general of this 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.509
 usually 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.249
 split 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:23.289
 of a fatty acid in this case four acids a fatty acid of four 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.169
 carbons 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.200
 It has to happen 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.310
 by several processes or by several repetitive cycles until having a 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.309
 fatty acid 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:36.939
 with less amounts of carbon in this case we have obtained we start from a 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.139
 fatty acid four charges to have a fatty acid 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.829
 two carbons 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.090
 so that way that this fatty acid is degraded 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.479
 in going through several cycles 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.459
 let's see how oxidation, hydration 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.399
 what is fundamentally about converting a long chain 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.850
 of fatty acid 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.549
 in smaller molecules like link tick enzyme as I had said 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.530
 and this must pass a repetitive phase of 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.619
 we had said that the citric acid or Krebs cycle 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.070
 this must be repeated several times 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.349
 so that the fatty acid is degraded more and more 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.300
 we start from an oxidation process 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.360
 that is to say the first fatty acid will oxidize 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.460
 then a part of hydration is hydrated 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.879
 then again it will oxidize 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.069
 will suffer a thiolysis reaction in the presence that is the part 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:35.969
 fundamental 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.529
 and thus degrade fatty acid to get a molecule like this 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.960
 over A 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.219
 or a fatty acid with fewer carbon numbers 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.399
 if I have more carbon numbers that will happen that again the cycle is going 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.100
 to repeat 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.779
 there will be an oxidation, a hydration, an oxidation and then thiolysis 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:01.259
 again if there is an excess of carbons it will continue repeating successively 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.309
 well the idea of ​​this is to start 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.410
 of a fatty acid 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.440
 of many carbon atoms numbers to a fatty acid with lower 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.420
 amount of 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.559
 carbons 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.770
 this in terms of the catabolism degradation of fatty acids 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.900
 the synthesis is a reverse process 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.570
 in catabolism we had said that the final part is to get an acid 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.180
 fatty with fewer carbon numbers 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.550
 So here we do 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.680
 we start from a fatty acid with fewer carbon numbers and also with two 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.940
 precursors that in this case would be asylum 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.580
 and the manonil 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.610
 as precursors 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.210
 what's happening here 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.939
 suffers a condensation reaction 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.439
 with these two precursors and the single molecule with less carbon number 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.809
 At the moment of the condensation a molecule is going to form 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:51.809
 more complex 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:52.999
 what's happening here 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.659
 it will also go through a series of reactions 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.319
 this case of a real reduction 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.860
 unlike metabolism remember that mentioning oxidation in this case is 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.369
 a 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:09.879
 reduce a dehydration again a reduction until having a molecule 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.499
 more complex 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:12.520
 If then 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.840
 in this case when we talk about lipid metabolism it's easier 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.389
 realize that one phase one process is inverse to the other process 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.360
 catabolism is inverse to the biosynthesis of fatty acids 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.490
 in this case we started with small molecules to form the most 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.650
 how important it is 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.560
 study lipid metabolism 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.200
 remember that fat lipids can be saturated fats 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.259
 that is butter or 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.960
 oils 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.139
 which is the complicated thing when we have an excess of lipids in our 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.159
 body 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.469
 this leads to obesity 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.929
 and when we do not have an adequate metabolism we are going to have clusters 

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:57.830
 too many of 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.649
 and this is very harmful to our health 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:06.499
 well this would be in the health part of our body but remember that when 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.689
 we studied the lipids we had said that these are part of the membranes 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:10.870
 cell phones 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.710
 that allow the passage 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.569
 or the semipreability of some substances and with it leads to its good 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.099
 operation of 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:23.330
 certain substances 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.599
 the activity encyclopedia 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.050
 functionality of certain substances 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.500
 organisms and cells 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.279
 It is very harmful to our body 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:37.219
 for example we have here that when they prevent the 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.469
 transfer of certain hormones 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:44.049
 does not allow its proper functioning inhibits its processes in this case processes 

00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:45.060
 inflammatory 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.379
 and that is very harmful also to our health 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:52.719
 that's why we have to have a good metabolism of both lipids and as we had 

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:53.969
 carbohydrate sayings 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.599
 since these two types of biomolecules are very important 

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.469
 as energy contributions for our organism 

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.989
 Thank you
