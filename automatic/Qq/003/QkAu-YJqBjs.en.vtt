00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.520 

our<00:00:34.820> team<00:00:35.120> has<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.329> lot<00:00:35.629> of<00:00:35.660> individual<00:00:36.260> players

defend<00:00:39.680> very<00:00:39.920> well<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.390> it's<00:00:41.539> not<00:00:41.690> really

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
defend very well and so it's not really

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.410 
defend very well and so it's not really
easy<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.230> score<00:00:42.589> dances<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.339> now<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:44.239> are<00:00:44.269> also

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
easy to score dances and now we are also

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.119 
easy to score dances and now we are also
taken<00:00:44.960> very<00:00:45.170> well<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.500> last<00:00:45.620> couple<00:00:45.769> of<00:00:46.070> years

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
taken very well the last couple of years

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:56.680 
taken very well the last couple of years
so<00:00:46.610> be<00:00:46.879> aware

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.810 

the<00:00:57.260> last<00:00:57.440> time<00:00:57.680> germany<00:00:58.100> won<00:00:58.280> gold<00:00:58.550> at<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
the last time germany won gold at the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.700 
the last time germany won gold at the
world<00:00:59.120> cup<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.510> nineteen<00:00:59.989> eighty-one<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.680> i

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
world cup was nineteen eighty-one so i

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.290 
world cup was nineteen eighty-one so i
think<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:01.100> about<00:01:01.250> time<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.640> we<00:01:01.850> gonna<00:01:02.120> get

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
think it's about time that we gonna get

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.710 
think it's about time that we gonna get
for<00:01:02.510> gold

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.420 

my<00:01:10.720> name<00:01:10.870> is<00:01:10.990> Oliver<00:01:11.290> Kahn<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.070> captain

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430

of the German hockey team and play

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.660 
of the German hockey team and play
midfield<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.980> German<00:01:18.340> team<00:01:18.460> is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
midfield I think the German team is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.850 
midfield I think the German team is
often<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.360> very<00:01:19.600> good<00:01:19.780> team<00:01:19.960> at<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.530> tournament

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
often a very good team at a tournament

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.520 
often a very good team at a tournament
because<00:01:21.130> we<00:01:21.580> are<00:01:21.940> able<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.390> focus<00:01:22.600> play<00:01:23.380> our

best<00:01:23.680> hockey<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.790> important<00:01:25.180> matches

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.040 

the<00:01:36.770> tournament<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.370> Holland<00:01:38.330> are<00:01:38.450> always<00:01:38.780> a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
always one hundred percent motivated

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300 
always one hundred percent motivated
when<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> comes<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> world<00:02:20.800> cup<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.280> two

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
when it comes to to the world cup or two
