00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
them from doing it before they did it so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
them from doing it before they did it so
the<00:01:08.280> reason<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.670> didn't<00:01:09.000> wasn't<00:01:09.390> able<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the reason I didn't wasn't able to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.760 
the reason I didn't wasn't able to
record<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.320> reaction<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.549> um<00:01:12.770> was

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
record a reaction was because um was

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
record a reaction was because um was
because<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.460> run<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> world<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:16.140> friend

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
because I don't run the world my friend

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
because I don't run the world my friend
Colin<00:01:16.830> runs<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> world<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.520> hosts<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> world

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
Colin runs the world he hosts the world

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.469 
Colin runs the world he hosts the world
so<00:01:18.860> sometimes<00:01:19.860> i'm<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.700> they're<00:01:21.270> on

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so sometimes i'm not on and they're on

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.499 
so sometimes i'm not on and they're on
so<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.350> means<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.820> that's<00:01:23.820> why<00:01:24.119> when<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so that means that that's why when we

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.270 
so that means that that's why when we
were<00:01:24.659> playing<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.259> doing<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.040> weren't
