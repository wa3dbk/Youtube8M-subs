though because of the way it's molded

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.020 
though because of the way it's molded
but<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.710> does<00:02:22.860> spin<00:02:23.130> around<00:02:23.460> just<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.760> so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but it does spin around just like so

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
little ball joints and the wrists can

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.930 
little ball joints and the wrists can
pop<00:02:25.980> them<00:02:26.190> off<00:02:26.460> really

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
pop them off really

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.610 
pop them off really
easy<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.300> throw<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> other<00:02:28.020> fists<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.500> if

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
easy like throw the other fists on if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
easy like throw the other fists on if
you<00:02:28.710> want<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.610> he's<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:29.820> an<00:02:29.940> ab<00:02:30.150> crunch
