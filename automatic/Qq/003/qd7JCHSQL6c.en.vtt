00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.380
 hello everyone my name is Pablo and in this 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.419
 video I will do a tutorial on 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.700
 rubik twist on how to make the frog was 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.330
 the toad 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 good 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 the truth is that the frog is one of the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.860
 easier to do because in your 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.090
 realization are always employed 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 parallel movements 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.940
 what does this mean if in this 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.700
 side move 2 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.590
 for example so all down on the 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.770
 another opposite we are going to have to move 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.010
 all down is also saying 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.690
 always opposite movement 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.570
 let's start 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.469
 The first thing you have to know is that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.540
 a good twist ruby has to have 24 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.180
 triangles 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.420
 if you do not have 24 is that this the Chinese 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.839
 and even this one that is bad but and twist 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 It has 24 triangles so that one 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.320
 part is looking up and another 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.990
 down always always if not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.090
 you buy another one because it's good what 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.630
 first thing we're going to do is count 12 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:24.590
 triangulitos 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 y 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.979
 12 voucher 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.539
 would be here on the 12th and if we count on the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:38.539
 another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 would be 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.119
 here on the line of the intersection 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's do let's do this two 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.350
 sometimes double twice 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.350
 so that we have something like that 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.200
 a kind of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.320
 of triangle in the middle 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.600
 it gets in the way 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.950
 once we have our rugby like that 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.270
 always parallel twist 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.050
 Well, let's do the following 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.880
 movement 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.440
 we would not know what are you native for a 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.580
 second and we take here and we fold 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 towards us 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.600
 I repeat 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.920
 we take 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.430
 we talk about these and we double the first 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.080
 towards us and since I was referring to 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.050
 which are parallel movements to what if 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.900
 in that we move towards us in this 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.349
 this here we're going to have to move towards 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.349
 we 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.409
 it stays like this this will be the future 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.569
 face of the frog the frog good for 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.709
 we take like this 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.709
 so let's go our 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.410
 our lobby twist 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.210
 and let's do the following we count 3 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.960
 squares 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.920
 1 2 and 3 and in the third we are going to turn 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.819
 twice 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.819
 so that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.799
 we turn twice 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.310
 I repeat it we have three squares and in 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.310
 the third we turn twice 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.200
 so that we have something like that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.440
 looking towards us a kind of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.540
 payment and how are parallel movements in 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.210
 this let's count 3 1 2 and 3 and we're going to 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.010
 perform the same movement from the 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.050
 third let's turn twice a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.980
 and two that we have something like that 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.470
 a kind of little legs sitting badly 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.090
 13 is a very common number at the time 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.860
 to make this app 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.430
 now you will see why 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.490
 we have already done that I repeat if there is nothing 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.500
 Clear 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:13.810
 we have counted 3 1 2 and 3 and we have rotated 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.810
 1 2 and 3 and we have rotated 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.170
 now 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.080
 but we have counted 3 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.590
 and we have turned this way and we have counted 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.690
 three have turned it over here because 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.830
 now let's take it like that we were going to 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.750
 count 3 1 2 and 3 and in the third of 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.640
 again no matter which side because it 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.180
 let's do in the other in the inverse 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 the third 1 2 and 3 have thus our 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.740
 rugby twist let's do the same thing 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.270
 before we turn twice in this case 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
 outward because if it does not get in the way 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.470
 would do 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:58.470
 we turn twice and as they are movements 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.470
 parallels 1 2 and 3 and we rotate 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.300
 a 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.070
 a whistle a 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.930
 one you resist me today 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.930
 and twice so that we stay like this 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.480
 Now what will we do let's put 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.700
 side no matter what side but always 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.490
 we are going to look in the face 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.670
 I'm going to get like that with my face here 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:35.449
 on this side we are going to tell 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:38.990
 from here from this leg 1 2 and 3 again 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.439
 2 and 3 and in the third we are going to turn 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.460
 outward since if we turn towards 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:49.180
 inside would prevent us from this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.000
 1 2 and 3 and out and in this one 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:57.220
 the same for movements for 1 2 and 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.500
 3 and out and we almost have 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.069
 our branch the only thing that remains is 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.360
 move these are 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.509
 the legs what the plants follow 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.120
 down as the vertices towards 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.360
 down 1 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.259
 and the other vertex 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.259
 down 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.080
 so that we already have our actor 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.790
 rana rubik tourist 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.570
 done good 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.240
 I hope I have served you and that you 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.550
 you like to subscribe if you have 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.770
 also liked more sectorial videos what 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.980
 that is, you do not write in the comments and 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.190
 well I'll see you in another video until 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.190
 soon
