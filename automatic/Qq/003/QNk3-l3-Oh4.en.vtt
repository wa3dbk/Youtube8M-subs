00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Russell Wilson and I think if you sort

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
Russell Wilson and I think if you sort
of<00:01:35.940> combine<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.390> both<00:01:36.510> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:38.100> sort

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of combine them both and then you sort

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.570 
of combine them both and then you sort
of<00:01:38.370> have<00:01:38.490> me<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.930> quarterback<00:01:40.440> draw<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:41.280> the
