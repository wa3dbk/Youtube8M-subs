00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.750
 Good my dear, until the present 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.490
 now we have png point layout that will be 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.510
 the benchmark we set up our 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.940
 site 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.140
 we have the index.hu energy that will be the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.300
 that we will use to make the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.720
 closing the homepage of our 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.800
 site and the fish point png to make the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.329
 other records that we will be 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.700
 using our project 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.110
 Let's go first then idex and people 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.210
 You have to visualize what people 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.829
 Can you do it with the taboo lesson? 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.020
 What we'll need is an image 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.000
 to be able to do so if you come here 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 Can you see that too little 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.110
 thing we can not produce 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.590
 only with the taboo east that would be what 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.310
 our readers the gradient effect of the menu 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.680
 the button of our mall and the 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.020
 here are just the laws there. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.670
 lights that we'll need 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.110
 to set up our site 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.590
 Come on then I'll take the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.400
 I'll log off the phones shots 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.799
 menu icons and all tabs 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.689
 we can and deleting everything selects by 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.620
 Let's go until you have no more 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.920
 no and now we will select 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:20.290
 here tool slice tool and let's 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.970
 actual market this will be our slides 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.100
 we have down here and we name for 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.729
 readers 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.159
 we are now marking the lowest 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.950
 notice that you made a menu of 35 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.340
 pixels so check here you are there 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.820
 with 35 also ok we can name for that 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.860

 transparent background but it has a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.970
 a larger compression and leaves the image 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:25.300
 with less size to load 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.840

 selected slice we will have here all 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.990
 images we need for our 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.550
 development and assembly of our website 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.060
 We'll still work the images now. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.910
 I'm going to the folder where I saved the 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.810
 my images with the right button on 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.810
 top of menu 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.600
 I'm going to open with the proxy firewall I'm going to give 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.830
 one against x1 the door and you come 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.580
 cavas 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.580
 I'm going to double my height of 35 will be 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.539
 70 exactly the double control c control 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.600
 v 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.729
 the kick doubling our read can I 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.860
 I come here with a rectangle to create a 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.169
 rectangle exactly on the rectangle 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.400
 under 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:39.580
 let's put a linear gradient 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.900
 I'll pick it up here and it's going to be 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:46.270
 exactly the best we'll get the bottom one 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.210
 exactly the top of our junior 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.950
 to get clearer and the top taxi 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.290
 even more clearly than this to do the 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.820
 effect, we then select the 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.400
 same color we see here 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.070
 Collor a site like ymca and we will vary 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.050
 a little this thing then stay a little 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.390
 more clear when we do the effect 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.140
 clothing on the low-set menu goes 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.790
 to assume 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.700
 highlighting the icon that we are 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.580
 passing the mouse that I can come here in 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.220
 catanduva size and width of it 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.620
 the button a pixel will be just that line 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.570
 that we will have to repeat 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.030
 horizontally and against the 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:25.660
 save and jotapeg and we already have 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:28.840
 Our menu is wetter than 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.490
 any not ok that's it 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.470
 so now we have everything we need 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.070
 to build and structure our site with 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.070
 taboo bids
