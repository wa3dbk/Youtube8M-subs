or<00:00:06.960> something<00:00:07.379> but<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.280> wouldn't<00:00:08.639> really

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
or something but I wouldn't really

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.789 
or something but I wouldn't really
consider<00:00:08.940> these<00:00:09.360> like<00:00:10.160> that<00:00:11.160> real<00:00:11.610> when

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
consider these like that real when

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.829 
consider these like that real when
there's<00:00:13.799> no<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.059> use<00:00:15.179> any<00:00:15.360> Pokemon

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there's no like you can use any Pokemon

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.310 
there's no like you can use any Pokemon
right<00:00:16.080> they're<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.289> BGC<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.369> whatever<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> my

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right they're not BGC or whatever so my

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.670 
right they're not BGC or whatever so my
whole<00:00:20.100> team's<00:00:20.490> strategy<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.180> based<00:00:21.390> on

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
whole team's strategy is based on

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
whole team's strategy is based on
assuming<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.340> other<00:00:23.640> teams<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.060> only<00:00:24.269> bring

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
assuming that other teams can only bring

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.560 
assuming that other teams can only bring
certain<00:00:24.900> Pokemon<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> did<00:00:27.000> expect<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
certain Pokemon so I did expect that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.410 
certain Pokemon so I did expect that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
should I just double Tyranitar so I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.290 
should I just double Tyranitar so I
Thunderbolt<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:52.879> strike<00:00:53.879> thunderbolt<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
moon blasts I hate doubling up because

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
moon blasts I hate doubling up because
then<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.609> afraid<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.300> they'll<00:01:00.629> protect<00:01:01.020> or

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
