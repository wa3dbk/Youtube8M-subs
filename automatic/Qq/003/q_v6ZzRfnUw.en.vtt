differently<00:01:21.290> than<00:01:21.710> something<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.070> been

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
differently than something that's been

sitting in at 75 rating or at 55 that's

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.570 
sitting in at 75 rating or at 55 that's
a<00:01:25.850> period<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.240> time<00:01:26.470> once<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.650> wine<00:01:28.070> gets<00:01:28.340> out

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
a period of time once the wine gets out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.620 
a period of time once the wine gets out
of<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.210> producers<00:01:30.640> domain<00:01:31.640> they're<00:01:32.509> all

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
of the producers domain they're all

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.050 
of the producers domain they're all
going<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.840> take<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.110> new<00:01:33.229> trajectories<00:01:34.060> that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
going to take on new trajectories that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.490 
going to take on new trajectories that
makes<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.330> little<00:01:35.450> tricky<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.990> talk<00:01:36.350> about

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
makes a little tricky to talk about

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.490 
makes a little tricky to talk about
absolutely<00:01:37.399> this<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.020> window<00:01:39.020> will<00:01:39.200> break

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
absolutely this is the window will break

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.950 
absolutely this is the window will break
and<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:40.580> someone<00:01:40.880> who<00:01:41.030> wants<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.420> store<00:01:41.720> wine

and for someone who wants to store wine

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.650 
and for someone who wants to store wine
at<00:01:42.170> home<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.920> mentioned<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.369> 55<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.360> 60

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
at home you mentioned that 55 to 60

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.540 
at home you mentioned that 55 to 60
degrees<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.229> ideal<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:45.890> temperature<00:01:46.369> what

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
degrees is ideal for temperature what

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.859 
degrees is ideal for temperature what
else<00:01:46.700> should<00:01:46.880> they<00:01:46.940> look<00:01:47.210> for<00:01:47.270> do<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:47.690> need

they yeah and I'll show you one of these

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.330 
they yeah and I'll show you one of these
okay<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.140> kind<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.860> ideal<00:01:55.100> situation

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
okay this is kind of the ideal situation

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.100 
okay this is kind of the ideal situation
because<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.060> can<00:01:56.180> get<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.479> anything<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.899> want

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
because you can get to anything you want

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.200 
because you can get to anything you want
to<00:01:57.320> as<00:01:58.070> long<00:01:58.280> as<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.610> don't<00:01:58.670> want<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.910> age<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.149> a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
to as long as you don't want to age it a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.430 
to as long as you don't want to age it a
long<00:01:59.390> time<00:01:59.630> then<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.930> should<00:02:00.050> be<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.289> box

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
long time then it should be in a box

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.740 
long time then it should be in a box
some<00:02:00.830> place<00:02:01.039> where<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.640> get<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:02.720> I

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
some place where you can get to but I

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.510 
some place where you can get to but I
think<00:02:03.050> more<00:02:03.410> than<00:02:03.530> anything<00:02:03.800> just<00:02:04.009> name<00:02:04.340> a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
think more than anything just name a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.330 
think more than anything just name a
temperature<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.560> passive<00:02:06.950> cellar<00:02:07.160> is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
temperature in a passive cellar is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.070 
temperature in a passive cellar is
pretty<00:02:07.610> good<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.000> if<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.330> climbs<00:02:08.599> slightly

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
pretty good and if it climbs slightly

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.449 
pretty good and if it climbs slightly
over<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.410> course<00:02:09.649> of

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
over the course of

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.130 
over the course of
I<00:02:10.489> don't<00:02:11.299> see<00:02:11.420> anything<00:02:11.569> wrong<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.989> I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
I don't see anything wrong with that I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
I don't see anything wrong with that I
think<00:02:12.340> traditionally<00:02:13.340> that's<00:02:13.459> how<00:02:13.640> people's

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
think traditionally that's how people's

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.470 
think traditionally that's how people's
people's<00:02:14.599> sellers<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.110> been<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
people's sellers have been and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.610 
people's sellers have been and
traditional<00:02:17.480> wine<00:02:17.659> drinking<00:02:18.019> is<00:02:18.200> evolved

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
traditional wine drinking is evolved

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.710 
traditional wine drinking is evolved
along<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.489> traditional<00:02:19.970> scholar<00:02:20.209> right

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
along the traditional scholar right

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.210 
along the traditional scholar right
there's<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.019> little<00:02:21.349> character<00:02:21.860> yeah<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.159> I

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
there's a little character yeah but I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.679 
there's a little character yeah but I
think<00:02:22.400> daily<00:02:22.790> changes<00:02:23.239> are<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.629> be

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
think daily changes are going to be

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.210 
think daily changes are going to be
really<00:02:24.430> intended<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.700> cause<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.569> wines<00:02:26.780> to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
really intended to cause the wines to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:46.480 
really intended to cause the wines to
challenge<00:02:28.220> by<00:02:28.370> oxygen<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.849> little<00:02:29.150> sooner

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.550 

you
