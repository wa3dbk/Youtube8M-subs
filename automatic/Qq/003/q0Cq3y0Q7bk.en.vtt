hello<00:00:00.930> YouTube<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.589> just<00:00:01.890> thought<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.190> would

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hello YouTube I just thought I would

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello YouTube I just thought I would
share<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> little<00:00:03.330> prototype<00:00:04.170> design<00:00:04.560> that

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
share you a little prototype design that

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.670 
share you a little prototype design that
I'm<00:00:04.859> working<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.990> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.319> circuit

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
I'm working on and this is the circuit

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.610 
I'm working on and this is the circuit
diagram<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:08.340> got<00:00:08.929> you<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:10.110> we've<00:00:10.260> got<00:00:10.410> here

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
diagram I've got you see we've got here

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.180 
diagram I've got you see we've got here
a<00:00:10.769> relay<00:00:11.660> but<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.809> soap<00:00:13.049> had<00:00:13.320> input<00:00:13.650> you're

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a relay but the soap had input you're

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.660 
a relay but the soap had input you're
the<00:00:14.400> maintenance<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.230> happen<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:17.520> what

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the maintenance and the happen now what

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.349 
the maintenance and the happen now what
this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.850> designed<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.560> will

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
this is designed to do is it will

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.380 
this is designed to do is it will
prioritize<00:00:21.359> solar<00:00:21.990> power<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.180> when<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.269> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
prioritize solar power so when this is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.230 
prioritize solar power so when this is
activated<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:24.990> coil<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:26.070> energized<00:00:26.519> these

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
activated this coil is energized these

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140 
activated this coil is energized these
contacts<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.779> closed<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.760> power<00:00:29.760> began<00:00:29.970> for

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
contacts have closed and power began for

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.770 
contacts have closed and power began for
strength<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> power<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.980> load<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
strength and so power to your load and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
strength and so power to your load and
then<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> power<00:00:34.710> runs<00:00:34.770> down<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> solar

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
then when the power runs down the solar

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.889 
then when the power runs down the solar
panel<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.239> tiny<00:00:36.420> better<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> run

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
panel so it's not tiny better to run

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.850 
panel so it's not tiny better to run
flat<00:00:37.340> this<00:00:38.340> relay<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.820> switch<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
flat this relay will switch off and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.750 
flat this relay will switch off and
priority<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.129> given<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> mains

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
priority will then be given to the mains

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.180 
priority will then be given to the mains
so<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.239> automatic<00:00:42.870> transfer<00:00:43.500> switch<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so it's automatic transfer switch and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.569 
so it's automatic transfer switch and
this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.510> design<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:45.870> working<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.579> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this is the design I'm working on this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.479 
this is the design I'm working on this
is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.210> actual<00:00:48.450> product<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:48.989> I've<00:00:49.079> made<00:00:49.489> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is the actual product but I've made so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.770 
is the actual product but I've made so
you've<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> relay<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> center<00:00:51.600> there

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you've got the relay in the center there

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650 
you've got the relay in the center there
you've<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.199> mains<00:00:52.890> input<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.660> with

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you've got your mains input here with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
you've got your mains input here with
your<00:00:54.809> solar<00:00:55.079> input<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.280> your

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
your solar input here and then your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
your solar input here and then your
output<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.809> output<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> lamp

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
output going in output or got a lamp

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.569 
output going in output or got a lamp
going<00:01:00.350> input<00:01:01.350> coming<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> side<00:01:02.280> plug

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going input coming in from the side plug

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.149 
going input coming in from the side plug
so<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.359> power<00:01:03.780> strip<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
so that's also power strip here and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.660 
so that's also power strip here and
input<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> mains<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.310> flick

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
input from the mains and then if I flick

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.480 
input from the mains and then if I flick
the<00:01:08.760> switch<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> should<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> lamp

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the switch off you should see the lamp

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
the switch off you should see the lamp
stay<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.460> oh<00:01:15.229> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
stay on so here we go off and then oh so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.940 
stay on so here we go off and then oh so
that's<00:01:16.290> off<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.270> look<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that's off and on you look that here you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.149 
that's off and on you look that here you
can<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.549> reader<00:01:20.850> clicking<00:01:21.119> over<00:01:22.159> that's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can see the reader clicking over that's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
can see the reader clicking over that's
off<00:01:23.280> oh<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.180> one<00:01:27.350> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
off oh no it's not and then one of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.160 
off oh no it's not and then one of
course<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:29.180> relay<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.420> LED<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.750> top<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
course this a relay has an LED on top so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
course this a relay has an LED on top so
you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.740> live<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:33.299> if

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you can see if it's live or not or if

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
you can see if it's live or not or if
the<00:01:33.659> context<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> closed<00:01:34.290> iam<00:01:34.500> sorry<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> off

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the context is closed iam sorry so off

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
the context is closed iam sorry so off
and<00:01:36.829> on<00:01:38.000> now<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> slight<00:01:39.960> change<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and on now there is a slight change in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
and on now there is a slight change in
phase<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.920> course<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.400> using<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.729> pure

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
phase of course because I'm using a pure

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.100 
phase of course because I'm using a pure
sine<00:01:42.150> wave<00:01:42.180> inverter<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:44.899> your<00:01:45.899> phase

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
sine wave inverter so your your phase

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.569 
sine wave inverter so your your phase
angles<00:01:46.470> won't<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> matched<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
angles won't be matched up when you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.880 
angles won't be matched up when you
switch<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> sometimes<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
switch over so there is sometimes a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.469 
switch over so there is sometimes a
little<00:01:49.920> flash<00:01:50.250> coming<00:01:50.549> from<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> lamp<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> we

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
little flash coming from the lamp and we

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.440 
little flash coming from the lamp and we
then<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> candle<00:01:52.259> pick<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:53.329> when<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
then have the candle pick it up when it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.069 
then have the candle pick it up when it
switches<00:01:54.720> over

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
switches over

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.679 
switches over
but<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:56.430> general<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.149> open<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.659> not

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
but in general it's not open it's not

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
but in general it's not open it's not
too<00:01:57.869> bad<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.920> you're<00:01:59.070> running<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> off

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
too bad and if you're running it off

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
too bad and if you're running it off
something<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.479> DC<00:02:01.049> rectified

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
something which is DC rectified

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
something which is DC rectified
afterwards<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.329> notice<00:02:03.689> any

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
afterwards you don't notice any

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.480 
afterwards you don't notice any
difference<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.350> safely<00:02:04.590> run<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> TV<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
difference you can safely run a TV and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
difference you can safely run a TV and
stuff<00:02:05.729> I've<00:02:05.909> run<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.210> things<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.780> 500<00:02:07.380> watts

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
stuff I've run up things up to 500 watts

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
stuff I've run up things up to 500 watts
off<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.220> been<00:02:08.340> okay<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.929> I'm

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
off this and it's been okay but I'm

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.960 
off this and it's been okay but I'm
going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.349> putting<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.830> nicer<00:02:11.190> box<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to be putting into a nicer box and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.730 
going to be putting into a nicer box and
making<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.629> pretty

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
making it look more pretty

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.950 
making it look more pretty
and<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.070> seems<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.730> work<00:02:14.880> quite<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.780> if

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and it seems to work quite well so if

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.530 
and it seems to work quite well so if
you<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> copy<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.770> design<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you want to copy my design and it's a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.480 
you want to copy my design and it's a
great<00:02:18.720> idea<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.050> you've<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.490> off-grid

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
great idea if you've got a off-grid

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.010 
great idea if you've got a off-grid
system<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.450> switch<00:02:21.600> over<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
system and then you can switch over to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.200 
system and then you can switch over to
on<00:02:22.860> grid<00:02:23.810> quite<00:02:24.810> quickly<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.200> easily<00:02:25.290> so

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
on grid quite quickly and easily so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.540 
on grid quite quickly and easily so
thank<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.270> very<00:02:27.390> much
