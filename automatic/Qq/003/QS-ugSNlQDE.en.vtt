00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.560

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the home's natural recipes 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.280
 natural ingredients that I liked the most 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.000
 to use in 2013 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 so go gay the products here are because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 also written that bring almost 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 whole kitchen here so I'll just 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.070
 Talk to you there is from the recipes that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.720
 I made it on the channel, I 'll leave it. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.640
 the link in the information bank then 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 then you give a check 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 It's to check information box you 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.000
 must're watching the video the channel 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 on youtube you can not find one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 stroke information you have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.149
 wind down the page you have to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.500
 access youtube to see 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.940
 o stroke information 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 So let's start talking about the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.559
 ingredients is the avocado was one thing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 which I really enjoyed using in that year of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.440
 2013 it leaves super soft hair is 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.390
 great for dryness so avocado was 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.160
 a cool thing to use this year and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.559
 also has corn starch from the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 Masa hydration on what I liked 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.100
 too much 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 sometimes she prepares it with milk at 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 Sometimes I prepare her with water I feel 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 that gives a little yes difference knows 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 I like both ways 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.259
 sometimes I like to use milk 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.680
 Sometimes I like to use more water then 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.130
 I'll have milk when I use milk. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 also ends up going into this part 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.829
 my own thing 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.189
 that you are too much is hydration that I 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.430
 made of hydration as honey 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.259
 milk and the mask in most 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.090
 Homemade moisturizing that I do 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.970
 I always put a little bit of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 mask I could make only revenue without 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.000
 the mask but I like to slip 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.670
 best in the hair to stick to one with 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.200
 essence with the smell of the mask 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.619
 so I'd rather grow up 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 any brand to bind 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.560
 recipe 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.549
 then hydration with honey and cream 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.710
 milk 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.640
 A little mask was pretty cool. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.099
 is also left super soft hair and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.649
 super shined a very cool effect a 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 pretty good free super controlled effect 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.720
 so it's another one I loved the a that year 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 the implementation of banana with 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 Olive I liked it too much, but she did not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.760
 I did not make any videos on the channel 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 so I even put just the same recipe 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.830
 Blog on writing lan 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.989
 so I'll leave it to me, too 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 banana plantation 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.670
 people have complained are the little pieces 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.680
 of banana but practically all 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.599
 homemade recipes end up being more 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.130
 difficult to remove hair so 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.319
 there are people who does not like 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.000
 use but we leave the ball 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.510
 competitor comes out very easily 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.459
 then I pass a content well the environment 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.930
 It also helps a lot I never had 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.200
 no problem to remove these 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.810
 homemade hair recipes then this 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.970
 banana with olive oil like 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.400
 I also can not forget the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.160
 coconut milk is another ingredient yes 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.459
 that leaves the hair super soft that I 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.130
 I mix in some masks and another 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.780
 homemade ingredient that I used in yes 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.209
 which I showed most recently in the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 that the palin to the hair is not a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.930
 hydration is to clean the hair that is the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.880
 baking soda that I mix 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.859
 shampoo and uses to wash hair that 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.480
 it works like a reed where I live then 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.400
 I really liked it too 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.410
 good people then this is ingredient 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.549
 things we encountered 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.400
 in the kitchen 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.459
 these are the favorites that I liked 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.620
 so more to use this year is not smart 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.530
 forgetting none now 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.349
 remembering thinking here what I used 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.349
 in the ingredients that I liked to use 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.299
 I remember those , but if I come 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.480
 Remember some more I'm leaving. 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.940
 written here in the video for you to see 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.510
 but I think it was just that anyway 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.920
 favorite is this all effects 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.569

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.079

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.540
 then these recipes are the 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.040
 favorite ingredients I used this year 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.319

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.419

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.880

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.109
 2014 we're still going to have a lot of revenue 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.380
 homemade 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.440
