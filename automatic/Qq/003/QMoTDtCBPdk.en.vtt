relative to the custom built computer so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
relative to the custom built computer so
in<00:01:11.490> effect<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.750> getting<00:01:13.020> what

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in effect you're really not getting what

computer<00:01:16.110> now<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:18.270> places<00:01:18.509> where

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
computer now they are some places where

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
computer now they are some places where
a<00:01:19.320> prequel<00:01:19.890> computer<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.670> better<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a prequel computer would be better and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
a prequel computer would be better and
that's<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> sub<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.439> three<00:01:22.680> hundred

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's really the sub of three hundred

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.730 
that's really the sub of three hundred
and<00:01:23.070> fifty<00:01:23.340> dollar<00:01:23.659> price<00:01:24.659> point<00:01:25.020> under<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and fifty dollar price point under this

and fifty dollar price point under this
price<00:01:26.070> point<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.490> usually<00:01:26.700> won't<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.330> buying

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
price point you usually won't be buying

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.740

a<00:01:27.960> gaming<00:01:28.590> PC<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.430> building<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> gaming<00:01:30.060> PC<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
a gaming PC or building a gaming PC you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
a gaming PC or building a gaming PC you
would<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.650> use<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.189> computer<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.610> web

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
would probably use the computer for web

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
would probably use the computer for web
surfing<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.320> word<00:01:35.250> processing<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
surfing and or word processing or just

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
surfing and or word processing or just
for<00:01:36.720> flash<00:01:36.930> games<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> honestly<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for flash games and honestly by the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
for flash games and honestly by the
computer<00:01:39.869> under<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> price<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.590> would

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
computer under that price point would

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.720 
computer under that price point would
probably<00:01:41.460> benefit<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.210> than<00:01:42.390> bill

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
probably benefit you more than bill

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.820 
probably benefit you more than bill
in<00:01:42.790> one<00:01:43.000> because<00:01:43.720> building<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.290> usually<00:01:44.650> for

should build a pc instead of by one is
the<00:02:01.000> fact<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.780> get<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:01.990> know<00:02:02.170> your

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the fact that you get to know your

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.230 
the fact that you get to know your
components<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.980> little<00:02:03.220> bit<00:02:03.310> more<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> I

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
components a little bit more and I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.580 
components a little bit more and I
really<00:02:04.510> want<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.720> guys<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.080> think<00:02:05.230> about<00:02:05.500> this

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
really want you guys to think about this

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.920 
really want you guys to think about this
one<00:02:05.800> for<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.040> minute<00:02:06.280> when<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.790> build<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.150> pc<00:02:07.300> you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
one for a minute when you build a pc you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.720 
one for a minute when you build a pc you
really<00:02:08.290> know<00:02:08.440> every<00:02:08.860> single<00:02:09.040> part<00:02:09.430> that<00:02:09.670> you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
really know every single part that you

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.240 
really know every single part that you
put<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.090> case<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> case<00:02:10.990> itself<00:02:11.440> but

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
put in that case and the case itself but

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
put in that case and the case itself but
it's<00:02:12.610> not<00:02:12.760> always<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.210> case<00:02:13.240> for<00:02:13.660> buying<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
it's not always the case for buying the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's not always the case for buying the
pc<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> pc<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.240> build<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.600> yourself

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
pc with the pc if you build it yourself

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.050 
pc with the pc if you build it yourself
you<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.740> change<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.160> parts<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.550> your<00:02:18.670> liking

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you can change the parts to your liking

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.270 
you can change the parts to your liking
maybe<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> want<00:02:19.600> an<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.960> core<00:02:20.200> cpu<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.950> fast

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
maybe you want an a core cpu and fast

maybe you want an a core cpu and fast

just going to go for a fast SSD and a
medium<00:02:28.690> sized<00:02:28.930> GPU<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:30.160> when<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> look<00:02:31.240> at

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
medium sized GPU but when you look at

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.050 
medium sized GPU but when you look at
real<00:02:31.600> toll<00:02:31.810> retail<00:02:32.650> computers<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.760> can't

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
real toll retail computers you can't

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.760 
real toll retail computers you can't
really<00:02:34.360> do<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.600> what<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.470> what<00:02:35.500> you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
really do that what you see is what you

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.250 
really do that what you see is what you
get<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.280> most<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.910> time<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.900> lot

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
get and most of the time you have a lot

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.560 
get and most of the time you have a lot
of<00:02:38.290> limits<00:02:38.740> now<00:02:39.070> there<00:02:39.460> are<00:02:39.700> some<00:02:39.730> sites<00:02:40.300> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
of limits now there are some sites that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.600 
of limits now there are some sites that
actually<00:02:41.110> let<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.470> change<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.010> components

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
actually let you change the components

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.060 
actually let you change the components
but<00:02:43.180> that's<00:02:43.870> still<00:02:44.200> limited<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.740> can<00:02:44.890> only

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
but that's still limited you can only

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.560 
but that's still limited you can only
change<00:02:45.370> components<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.150> compatible

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
change components that are compatible

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.740 
change components that are compatible
and<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.590> costs<00:02:47.830> more<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.730> price<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.360> also<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
and it costs more so price is also a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.280 
and it costs more so price is also a
factor<00:02:50.290> with<00:02:50.740> this<00:02:50.920> point<00:02:51.450> thirdly<00:02:52.450> upgrades

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
factor with this point thirdly upgrades

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.650 
factor with this point thirdly upgrades
are<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> lot<00:02:53.650> less<00:02:53.830> tedious<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.580> custom<00:02:55.480> built

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
are a lot less tedious on a custom built

drive and i think that's pretty crazy

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.750 
drive and i think that's pretty crazy
because<00:03:16.480> that's<00:03:16.900> always<00:03:17.230> some<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.489> parts

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
because that's always some of the parts

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760 
because that's always some of the parts
of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.000> pc<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.540> are<00:03:19.690> extremely<00:03:20.230> important

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
of the pc that are extremely important

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.730 
of the pc that are extremely important
most<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> time<00:03:22.090> that

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
most of the time that

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.920 
most of the time that
really<00:03:23.250> bad<00:03:23.430> motherboards<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.210> pretty<00:03:24.720> bad

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
really bad motherboards and pretty bad

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.350 
really bad motherboards and pretty bad
power<00:03:25.260> supplies<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.950> when<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> motherboard

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360

is<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> brain<00:03:27.960> of<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.350> computer<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.980> the

is the brain of the computer and the

is the brain of the computer and the
calcified<00:03:29.610> powers<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.660> brain<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.140> think<00:03:31.890> it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
calcified powers that brain I think it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.190 
calcified powers that brain I think it's
pretty<00:03:32.460> fair<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.000> believe<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.600> those<00:03:34.020> are

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
pretty fair to believe that those are

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860 
pretty fair to believe that those are
important<00:03:34.800> parts<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.640> system<00:03:35.940> because<00:03:36.720> of

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
important parts of the system because of

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
important parts of the system because of
this<00:03:36.990> upgrades<00:03:37.560> are<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.740> lot<00:03:37.980> more<00:03:38.010> tedious<00:03:38.580> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
this upgrades are a lot more tedious and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.230 
this upgrades are a lot more tedious and
you<00:03:39.660> usually<00:03:39.990> have<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.560> upgrade<00:03:40.800> other<00:03:41.730> parts

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
you usually have to upgrade other parts

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.300 
you usually have to upgrade other parts
just<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> initial<00:03:43.170> upgrade<00:03:43.590> upgradable

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
just have the initial upgrade upgradable
