00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so today I'm making a hammer that has

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.860 
so today I'm making a hammer that has
this<00:00:04.319> pattern<00:00:05.220> on<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:11.120> these<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this pattern on it these have to be the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.919 
this pattern on it these have to be the
best<00:00:13.080> deal<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.679> planet<00:00:14.179> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.450> ball

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
best deal on the planet this is a ball

hardened<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.340> much

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
hardened and then you can do pretty much

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
hardened and then you can do pretty much
anything<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> saw<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> drill<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.730 
whatever if it's been hardened like this
one<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
one you're going to have to use a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
one you're going to have to use a
carbide<00:01:38.210> cutting<00:01:39.210> disc<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.759> diamond<00:01:41.759> drill

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
carbide cutting disc or a diamond drill

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.740 
carbide cutting disc or a diamond drill
or<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> diamond<00:01:43.320> bur<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.790> put<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> pattern<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
or a diamond bur to put a pattern on it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.940 
or a diamond bur to put a pattern on it
I<00:01:46.310> tend<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> use<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:50.030> carbide<00:01:51.030> disc<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I tend to use the carbide disc so this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.569 
I tend to use the carbide disc so this
is<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:54.890> screw<00:01:55.890> mandrel<00:01:57.950> like<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is just a screw mandrel like like you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
is just a screw mandrel like like you
would<00:01:59.729> normally<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.689> an<00:02:00.810> abrasive

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
would normally have for an abrasive

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.850 
would normally have for an abrasive
wheel<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> I'll<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.540> show<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> quickly

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.100 

so<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.520> just<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:11.000> screw<00:02:11.330> mandrel<00:02:11.780> little

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
so this is just a screw mandrel little

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.970 
so this is just a screw mandrel little

just make sure you don't get it in your

eyes so when I put the disc on I just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.380 
eyes so when I put the disc on I just
run<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.290> hand<00:02:45.650> tight<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.310> that's<00:02:46.940> all<00:02:47.209> you

run it hand tight and that's all you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.900 
run it hand tight and that's all you
need<00:02:47.600> because<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.590> way<00:02:48.709> this<00:02:48.890> turns<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.610> self

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
tightening now what I like is a slightly

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.340 
tightening now what I like is a slightly
rounded<00:02:56.450> face<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> hammer<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:59.780> it's<00:03:00.049> dead

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
rounded face on the hammer if it's dead

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.039 
rounded face on the hammer if it's dead
flat<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:01.190> hard<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.790> get<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.180> decent<00:03:02.239> pattern

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
flat it's hard to get a decent pattern

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.750 
flat it's hard to get a decent pattern
when<00:03:03.319> you're<00:03:03.470> hammering<00:03:03.830> dead<00:03:04.220> flatten

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
when you're hammering dead flatten

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.539 
when you're hammering dead flatten
material<00:03:05.269> if<00:03:06.049> it's<00:03:06.349> just<00:03:06.620> slightly<00:03:06.950> rounded

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
material if it's just slightly rounded

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.690 
material if it's just slightly rounded
it<00:03:07.670> works<00:03:07.910> good<00:03:08.269> for<00:03:08.739> either<00:03:09.739> slightly

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
it works good for either slightly

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.410 
it works good for either slightly
rounded<00:03:11.150> material<00:03:11.720> or<00:03:12.019> flat<00:03:13.030> now<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:14.269> I'm

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
rounded material or flat now what I'm

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.979 
rounded material or flat now what I'm
going<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.750> do<00:03:14.989> is<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.590> draw<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.810> series<00:03:17.810> of

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
going to do is just draw a series of

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.110 
going to do is just draw a series of
Chevron's<00:03:19.780> starting<00:03:21.370> at<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.579> top<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.030> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
Chevron's starting at the top of the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.650 
Chevron's starting at the top of the
hammer<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.660> then<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:25.010> hammer<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:26.390> lean

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
hammer and then as I hammer I can lean

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.539 
hammer and then as I hammer I can lean
the<00:03:26.930> hammer<00:03:27.170> because<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.829> slightly<00:03:28.100> curved

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
the hammer because it's slightly curved

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.220 
the hammer because it's slightly curved
then<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:29.090> get<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.329> different<00:03:29.570> part<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
then I can get a different part of the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.979 
then I can get a different part of the
hammer<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.940> different<00:03:32.299> part<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.750> pattern

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
hammer the different part of the pattern

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:45.780 
hammer the different part of the pattern
so<00:03:33.950> I'm<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:34.310> going<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.690> by<00:03:36.019> eye

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:04:14.870 

we<00:03:46.790> want<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.060> nice<00:03:47.300> deep<00:03:47.720> cut<00:03:50.530> yeah

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.190 

and<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.180> tell<00:04:16.390> by<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.630> color<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.020> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
and you can tell by the color of the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.170 
and you can tell by the color of the
sparks<00:04:17.530> coming<00:04:17.800> out<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.700> middle<00:04:18.970> has

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
sparks coming out that the middle has

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:45.510 
sparks coming out that the middle has
been<00:04:19.420> hardened

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.830 

now<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.580> great<00:04:46.850> thing<00:04:47.060> about<00:04:47.090> these<00:04:47.450> hammers

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
now the great thing about these hammers

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.790 
now the great thing about these hammers
is<00:04:48.080> they're<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:48.560> cheap<00:04:48.890> that<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.800> just

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
is they're so cheap that you can just

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.250 
is they're so cheap that you can just
get<00:04:52.070> one<00:04:52.400> make<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.760> specific<00:04:53.180> pattern<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:54.050> it

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
get one make a specific pattern on it

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.730 
get one make a specific pattern on it
and<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:56.270> don't<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.870> worry<00:04:57.050> about<00:04:57.140> using

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
and you don't have to worry about using

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.370 
and you don't have to worry about using
it<00:04:57.860> for<00:04:58.040> anything<00:04:58.220> else<00:04:58.810> now<00:04:59.810> putting<00:05:00.200> the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
it for anything else now putting the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.380 
it for anything else now putting the
pattern<00:05:00.710> on<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.890> ball<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.700> back<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.180> kind

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
pattern on the ball on the back is kind

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.000 
pattern on the ball on the back is kind
of<00:05:02.540> worthless<00:05:02.720> because<00:05:03.260> it's<00:05:03.470> such<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.680> small

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
of worthless because it's such a small

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.390 
of worthless because it's such a small
area<00:05:04.610> so<00:05:05.270> what<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.450> do<00:05:05.630> is<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.620> would<00:05:06.680> grind<00:05:07.190> this

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
area so what I do is I would grind this

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.660 
area so what I do is I would grind this
down<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.980> have<00:05:10.160> a<00:05:10.190> little<00:05:10.550> bit

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
down so that you have a little bit

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.370 
down so that you have a little bit
larger<00:05:11.180> area<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.980> can<00:05:13.160> be<00:05:13.340> flat<00:05:13.640> and<00:05:13.910> then<00:05:14.780> you

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
larger area it can be flat and then you

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.370 
larger area it can be flat and then you
can<00:05:15.530> do<00:05:15.650> another<00:05:15.890> pattern<00:05:16.580> on<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.940> back

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
can do another pattern on the back

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.050 
can do another pattern on the back
otherwise<00:05:18.380> it's<00:05:18.860> it's<00:05:19.400> kind<00:05:19.670> of<00:05:19.760> pointless

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
otherwise it's it's kind of pointless

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.090 
otherwise it's it's kind of pointless
putting<00:05:20.480> a<00:05:20.570> pattern<00:05:20.930> just<00:05:20.960> on<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.530> very<00:05:21.740> end

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
putting a pattern just on the very end

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.310 
putting a pattern just on the very end
so<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:25.190> can<00:05:25.340> see<00:05:25.520> I've<00:05:25.730> just<00:05:25.760> cut<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.540> series<00:05:27.290> of

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
so you can see I've just cut a series of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.870 
so you can see I've just cut a series of
straight<00:05:27.890> lines<00:05:28.190> in<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:29.000> hammer<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:31.100> can<00:05:31.130> you

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
straight lines in the hammer you can you

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.910 
straight lines in the hammer you can you
can<00:05:32.150> do<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> curve<00:05:33.410> with<00:05:33.860> that<00:05:34.150> cut<00:05:35.150> off<00:05:35.300> disk

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
can do a curve with that cut off disk

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.180 
can do a curve with that cut off disk
that's<00:05:36.920> what<00:05:37.160> they<00:05:37.280> called<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.640> carbide<00:05:38.060> disc

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
that's what they called the carbide disc

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.030 
that's what they called the carbide disc
but<00:05:40.190> be<00:05:40.580> very<00:05:40.910> very<00:05:41.420> gentle<00:05:41.780> with<00:05:42.560> your<00:05:42.770> curve

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
but be very very gentle with your curve

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.890 
but be very very gentle with your curve
if<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.430> catch<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:43.790> in<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.180> groove<00:05:44.420> it<00:05:44.660> just

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
if you catch it in the groove it just

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.350 
if you catch it in the groove it just
shatters<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.530> disks<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:47.690> just<00:05:48.590> going<00:05:48.890> to

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
shatters the disks so just going to

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.820 
shatters the disks so just going to
touch<00:05:50.360> up<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.720> face<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.960> little<00:05:51.230> bit<00:05:51.380> with<00:05:51.620> my

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
touch up the face a little bit with my

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.310 
touch up the face a little bit with my
four<00:05:52.340> hundred<00:05:52.750> paper<00:05:53.750> on<00:05:54.050> my<00:05:54.230> sanding<00:05:54.740> stick

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
four hundred paper on my sanding stick

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.460 
four hundred paper on my sanding stick
and<00:05:57.320> we're<00:05:58.130> ready<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.580> test<00:05:59.240> out<00:05:59.510> the<00:06:00.260> hammer

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
and we're ready to test out the hammer

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.520 
and we're ready to test out the hammer
to<00:06:00.710> see<00:06:00.890> what<00:06:01.070> kind<00:06:01.280> of<00:06:01.340> pattern<00:06:01.520> look<00:06:01.850> good<00:06:02.530> so

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
to see what kind of pattern look good so

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.870 
to see what kind of pattern look good so
we'll<00:06:03.740> need<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:03.890> piece<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.430> annealed<00:06:04.880> middle<00:06:06.880> so

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
we'll need a piece of annealed middle so

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.910 
we'll need a piece of annealed middle so
I<00:06:07.940> have<00:06:08.150> a<00:06:08.180> piece<00:06:08.510> of<00:06:08.720> brass<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:09.410> I<00:06:09.590> annealed

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
I have a piece of brass that I annealed

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.270 
I have a piece of brass that I annealed
it<00:06:10.160> I'm<00:06:10.280> leaving<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.030> toxin<00:06:11.800> oxidize<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:13.010> I<00:06:13.070> can

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
it I'm leaving a toxin oxidize so I can

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.020 
it I'm leaving a toxin oxidize so I can
show<00:06:13.460> you<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.790> color<00:06:15.490> actually<00:06:16.490> so<00:06:16.820> I<00:06:16.880> can

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
show you the color actually so I can

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.560 
show you the color actually so I can
show<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.450> pattern<00:06:18.550> so<00:06:19.550> initially<00:06:20.120> I'm

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
show you the pattern so initially I'm

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.570 
show you the pattern so initially I'm
going<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.870> lean<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.200> hammer<00:06:21.440> forward<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.400> get

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
going to lean the hammer forward and get

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.700 
going to lean the hammer forward and get
this<00:06:22.610> front<00:06:23.060> edge<00:06:23.240> they'll<00:06:24.080> just<00:06:24.350> do<00:06:24.530> that

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
this front edge they'll just do that

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.740 
this front edge they'll just do that
down<00:06:25.100> one<00:06:25.370> side<00:06:25.670> and<00:06:25.700> then<00:06:26.090> I'll<00:06:26.210> lean<00:06:26.390> it<00:06:26.570> back

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
down one side and then I'll lean it back

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:45.969 
down one side and then I'll lean it back
and<00:06:27.020> get<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.290> back<00:06:27.470> edge

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.790 

not<00:06:46.979> much<00:06:47.190> difference<00:06:47.699> but<00:06:47.970> a<00:06:48.210> little<00:06:48.800> I'll

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
not much difference but a little I'll

00:06:49.800 --> 00:07:07.310 
not much difference but a little I'll
just<00:06:50.100> scrub<00:06:50.430> this<00:06:50.610> off<00:06:50.880> so<00:06:51.150> you<00:06:51.240> can<00:06:51.449> see<00:07:06.320> so

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
just scrub this off so you can see so

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.219 
just scrub this off so you can see so
this<00:07:07.910> was<00:07:08.910> done<00:07:09.180> with<00:07:09.449> the<00:07:09.570> front<00:07:09.840> edge<00:07:09.990> of<00:07:10.169> the

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
this was done with the front edge of the

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.920 
this was done with the front edge of the
hammer<00:07:10.530> and<00:07:10.830> this<00:07:11.789> was<00:07:12.060> done<00:07:12.330> with<00:07:12.570> the<00:07:12.720> back

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
hammer and this was done with the back

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:24.730 
hammer and this was done with the back
it's<00:07:13.830> slightly<00:07:14.250> different<00:07:14.699> I<00:07:19.910> like<00:07:20.910> it

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740
