00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
we've put in three hit training sessions

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
we've put in three hit training sessions
as<00:00:33.690> well<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.070> any<00:00:35.190> time<00:00:35.730> during

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
as well I can do it at any time during

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.780 
as well I can do it at any time during
the<00:00:36.210> week<00:00:36.380> my<00:00:37.380> check-ins<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.280> Thursdays

the week my check-ins are on Thursdays
so<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.899> literally<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> piece<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> paper<00:00:41.489> out

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
so I literally get a piece of paper out

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.299 
so I literally get a piece of paper out
and<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> how<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> there's<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and this is how I do it there's not a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
and this is how I do it there's not a
real<00:00:44.550> science<00:00:44.879> behind<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> changes<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> lot

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
real science behind and it changes a lot

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
real science behind and it changes a lot
so<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.739> I've<00:00:46.860> done<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.399> give<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> like

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
show in San Jose so I'm not going to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.520 
show in San Jose so I'm not going to
work<00:04:21.850> out<00:04:21.970> at<00:04:22.090> all<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.330> day<00:04:22.539> how<00:04:23.110> do<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.289> make

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
things work in there

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.380 
things work in there
well<00:04:25.150> what<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.330> might<00:04:25.690> do<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.970> don't<00:04:28.270> want

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
well what I might do is if I don't want

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.370 
well what I might do is if I don't want
to<00:04:28.450> work<00:04:28.540> out<00:04:28.660> here<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.020> usually<00:04:29.170> a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
to work out here and it's usually a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.790 
to work out here and it's usually a
lower-body<00:04:29.830> day<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.690> might<00:04:31.690> like<00:04:31.930> swap<00:04:32.470> these

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
lower-body day I might like swap these

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.870 
lower-body day I might like swap these
two<00:04:32.860> right<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.180> then<00:04:34.360> i<00:04:34.390> might<00:04:34.690> go<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:35.880> made

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
two right so then i might go like made

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.990 
two right so then i might go like made
switch<00:04:37.150> markers<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:42.070> my<00:04:42.280> split<00:04:42.730> might

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
switch markers so my split might

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.390 
switch markers so my split might
actually<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:44.020> no<00:04:44.830> lift<00:04:45.160> here<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.130> i<00:04:48.160> might

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
actually be like no lift here so i might

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.120 
actually be like no lift here so i might
do<00:04:48.580> lower<00:04:48.910> here<00:04:51.870> right<00:04:52.870> before<00:04:53.410> shoulders

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
do lower here right before shoulders

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.700 
do lower here right before shoulders
arms<00:04:55.770> not<00:04:56.770> my<00:04:56.950> be<00:04:57.130> chest<00:04:57.490> back<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.530> would

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
arms not my be chest back so this would

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.520 
arms not my be chest back so this would
be<00:04:59.740> off<00:05:00.070> right<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:01.030> because<00:05:01.750> i'm<00:05:01.900> not<00:05:02.170> doing

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
be off right and because i'm not doing

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.410 
be off right and because i'm not doing
cardio<00:05:02.920> there<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.550> know<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:06.270> I'm<00:05:07.270> gonna

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
cardio there I know that a I'm gonna

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.450 
cardio there I know that a I'm gonna
have<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.630> overload<00:05:08.200> these<00:05:08.500> days<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.100> like<00:05:09.250> this

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
have to overload these days so like this

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.790 
have to overload these days so like this
would<00:05:09.670> be<00:05:09.700> like<00:05:09.790> probably<00:05:10.620> hits<00:05:11.620> plus<00:05:12.430> 200<00:05:13.360> um

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.770 

this<00:05:17.800> would<00:05:18.190> definitely<00:05:18.340> be<00:05:18.670> that<00:05:19.000> 100<00:05:19.510> like<00:05:19.630> I

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
this would definitely be that 100 like I

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.230 
this would definitely be that 100 like I
said<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> warm<00:05:20.290> up<00:05:20.700> this<00:05:21.700> are<00:05:21.970> probably

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
said to warm up this are probably

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.480 
said to warm up this are probably
shoulders<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.810> arms<00:05:23.110> plus<00:05:23.500> like<00:05:23.710> 100<00:05:24.130> before

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
shoulders and arms plus like 100 before

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.240 
shoulders and arms plus like 100 before
and<00:05:24.610> 100<00:05:24.970> after<00:05:25.270> maybe<00:05:25.530> this<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.710> definitely

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
and 100 after maybe this is definitely

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.350 
and 100 after maybe this is definitely
going<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.520> be<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.670> hit<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.840> with<00:05:29.140> this<00:05:30.360> boo

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
going to be a hit and so with this boo

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.090 
going to be a hit and so with this boo
its<00:05:31.570> testing<00:05:31.990> back<00:05:32.140> nevermind<00:05:32.680> see<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:32.950> don't

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
its testing back nevermind see I don't

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.070 
its testing back nevermind see I don't
like<00:05:33.370> doing<00:05:33.550> cardio<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.090> day<00:05:34.240> or<00:05:34.560> this<00:05:35.560> day

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
like doing cardio that day or this day

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.170 
like doing cardio that day or this day
so<00:05:38.080> then<00:05:38.230> I<00:05:38.320> might<00:05:38.590> like<00:05:38.830> definitely<00:05:39.760> do<00:05:39.940> hit

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
so then I might like definitely do hit

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.220 
so then I might like definitely do hit
plus<00:05:40.510> 200<00:05:41.230> plus<00:05:41.560> that's<00:05:41.830> what<00:05:42.100> it's<00:05:42.940> five<00:05:43.230> six

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
plus 200 plus that's what it's five six

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.590 
plus 200 plus that's what it's five six
seven<00:05:44.730> then<00:05:45.730> I<00:05:45.790> might<00:05:45.940> come<00:05:46.120> back<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.480> like<00:05:46.540> a

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
seven then I might come back for like a

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.710 
seven then I might come back for like a
full<00:05:46.900> 30<00:05:47.200> minutes<00:05:47.530> of<00:05:47.620> spin<00:05:47.920> which<00:05:48.130> i<00:05:48.250> estimate

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
full 30 minutes of spin which i estimate

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.170 
full 30 minutes of spin which i estimate
spin<00:05:49.720> at<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:50.050> ten<00:05:50.260> calories<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.680> minute<00:05:51.180> so

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
spin at like ten calories a minute so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.470 
spin at like ten calories a minute so
again<00:05:52.480> I<00:05:52.860> hope<00:05:53.860> y'all<00:05:54.100> can<00:05:54.220> follow<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.790> but

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
again I hope y'all can follow that but

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.260 
again I hope y'all can follow that but
there's<00:05:55.630> not<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> real<00:05:56.140> rhyme<00:05:56.380> or<00:05:56.560> reason<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.980> it

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
there's not a real rhyme or reason to it

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.360 
there's not a real rhyme or reason to it
but<00:05:58.270> that's<00:05:58.420> kind<00:05:58.840> of<00:05:59.400> my<00:06:00.400> thought<00:06:00.580> process<00:06:01.060> a

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
but that's kind of my thought process a

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.180 
but that's kind of my thought process a
couple<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:03.580> absolutes<00:06:04.740> mostly<00:06:05.740> just<00:06:05.890> kind<00:06:06.100> of

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190
