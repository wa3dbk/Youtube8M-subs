00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.649
 only a gym 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.929
 Not only do you have to be an athlete, you must be interested in sports 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 then important prerequisite floated but of course it is not 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.550
 secure 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.960
 Dr the physical conditions and consequences requirements 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.339
 that will check 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 Oppenheim hold 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 I have a positive one 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.870
 keep the three points 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.300
 the Fachpraxis Fachdidaktiken trade visitors 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.229
 multiple practice Munich Arndt sports 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.560
 the athletics gymnastics swimming 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 but also want to ride trend sports 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 Ashley Sport and so on 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 Creative phases of study 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.550
 nla-spiel quasi in Hanover on the dismissal in Hamburg but had 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.910
 Others are not just about it, they are also about it 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.400
 to go to sports at school or in other occasions too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.890
 convey 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.310
 Not that the biggest brakeman on the site in North Rhine-Westphalia and also 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330
 one of the largest institutes in Germany at all 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.650
 our focus is very clear 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.940
 we have about 3500 student teachers 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.320
 the special experience that we created despite the biggest ever 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 in fact, to offer even small courses 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.690
 the emphasis on training 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.570
 then you can grow too 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.380
 and I think it also creates a sense of community for the students 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.550
 lie away 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.620
 which is widespread with each other is super 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.530
 the students have become daily and each other 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.060
 I think that is really due to the fact that you stop at 20 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 To people 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.390
 For example, a practical seminar is tours and I simply have to support it 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.510
 even with bands packing in the beginning all or have it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.989
 What am I doing here' 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.409
 So Steiner take in Halle and then learn 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.959
 In the end, everybody makes a rash or even in Salzburg the right and that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.709
 The development is still not easy to go through 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.839
 do not catch up 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.089
 theoretically 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.879
 Of course, how many undergraduates are doing the practical sports 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.449
 the main motivation 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.909
 and that is also fulfilled because the player was the future of the teachers 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.199
 and teachers of course also need sports practical skills 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.909
 but on the other hand, of course, they also need theoretical knowledge 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.199
 certain settings need to change 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.019
 develop with and with 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.799
 that means that you also have a theoretically demanding study 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.989
 on the one hand, this is twice as much as a percentage again 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.719
 In the study of sports science, there is really 50 50 cents 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.900
 Now in the fourth semester I can say that luck made paintball 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.040
 In addition to supporting what you learn in a specialized practice 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.009
 Sports scientists just just scientists not only do sports 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.509
 This is also reflected in the teaching as you learn how to do research and you 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.689
 can that also land yourself or the hose or a master thesis and 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.629
 manageable write 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.679
 also in general 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.789
 on the Nasdaq delayed the waste before game start or delayed 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.189
 moved athletically 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.739
 if science was also ridiculed 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.260
 a lot of research and there are students as students 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.249
 assistants 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.989
 also many subjects 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.449
 clamped 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.419
 and 2 avenues research so close up the sports science it turns out this way 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.929
 that it is not nature, just as humanities are set up 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.429
 and a student 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:49.049
 occupied if you will in all areas and he has of course 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.299
 also with one 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.109
 Difficulty to fight you also in the science around 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.120
 in psychology, for example, as well as formal model to statistics 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.489
 for example 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.719
 physics 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.639
 Percent and in the Spiritual Science Gates, of course, he wants texts then 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.519
 reading reading of texts for example history sociology for example 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.859
 Educator a very large field didactics a very big one yet 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.599
 Percent one learns basically seen 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.090
 who in sports study the whole range of nervousness many 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 of course, but then know only a lot more complicated 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.569
 So I have to say too 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.569
 this diversity the men sports students has the little grab it 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.430
 arose 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.860
 I can not sit at my desk for two hours 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.400
 all the time wants to be athletic 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.530
 who likes to learn and then I can go outside and stand football 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.659
 I really do not live well enough 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.240
 only the heirs 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.210
 alone for this change 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.059
 I think that is just the water walks 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.639
 what the whole thing somehow evolved away and even if they did not 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.960
 Doing a sport is still fun to move in between 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.759
 the big challenge sports federation the change of perspective from sporty 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.569
 active in the mediation of sports 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.949
 Most sports studies have arrived at sports history especially 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.839
 athletic performance gaining sporting experience and that's good too 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.150
 that's what we appreciate so much Â» 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.639
 but it can be a long way to get there 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.679
 that one conveys sport that one can empathize in Berne opposite 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.830
 and has appeals to kids and teens so the law needs me now 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.830
 look around 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.830
 Explosion are an important part of the study 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.120
 hardly likely 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.120
 Learning expertise as well as social learning 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.290
 The explosions take place in all areas of culture sports held in winter 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.369
 is, of course, the sport of snow in the first place in the evening was Marvin watersports 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.200
 besides excursions for example or games explosions in one 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.199
 Serbian 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.180
 alone on the ski slope 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.020
 several times was so violent for the ticket to Norway let the final score 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.189
 and that is past and therefore provides the fatigue to Bavaria 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.119
 or a trustworthy being beaten 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:25.400
 and hikes 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 So then one percent speaks in the student city 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.499
 which also leads to the friendly atmosphere 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:32.999
 Company ahead 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:34.369
 Russia will 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.369
 old allies 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.530
