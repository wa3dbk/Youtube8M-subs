00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.300
Good afternoon!

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509
Today we will
 cook pancakes with milk.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.169
Traditional, classic pancakes.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.400
I will teach you how to make them look
very thin and how to use ingridients  in a right proportion

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.240
so that your dough has turned out to be  delicious.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:49.100
See recipe below the video!

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Take eggs. Eggs should have a  
room temperature.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.210
Put eggs in the bowl, where they will be whipped.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.200
Whip eggs until thick foam.
Like that.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.900
Now we take salt.
Salt - a little less than half a teaspoon.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.159
That much.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.100
Don't be afraid to use salt for salt will activate suger and suger will activate salt.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.000
Therefore, to make your pancakes testy, add  a little less than half a teaspoon, for if you put less than that,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.900
the taste of suger will not be that swit.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
So - do not be afraid of salt,
Put a little less than a teaspoon.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.800
Now... suger.
I love sweet pancakes, so.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.000
I put 1-2 tablespoons.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.200
Now, let's mix it all.
See that  sugar has it's maximum dissolvement.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.260
Here we have suger completely dissolved and everything looks like a thickish egg mass.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.400
Now we add flour and again we use the mixer.
.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.600
Mix the ingredients untill you have a smooth mass.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:22.000
At first, do not turn on the mixer. Operate only with your hands,
and then - turn your mixer on

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.319
and kill until smooth.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.070
Now we take the milk.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.200
Very important: 
milk should have a room temperature.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.200
Never  warm up, and never use it right from 
 the refrigerator.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.669
otherwise you are sure to have 
 lumps in your dough.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.000
Well lumps are not a big deal,  for they will  dissolve on your frying pen anyway but to it is better to have a dougt without them.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
O.K. Now it's time to add some milk to to mix everything again.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.129
See how many bubbles!

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.900
The more, you, mix
the more air bubbles you receive

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.589
More bubbles - more good you have.

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.019
Now take the sunflower oil.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.900
I pour out a tablespoon
of sunflower oil into the dough.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.900
I mix it all in a good way-
and our dough is ready.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.099
How to check if the dough is ready?

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:40.700
Take a ladle: the dough should be leaky.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.249
It is not as leaky as water but it is leaky!

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.500
If your pancake dough is a little thick - it is not the end of the world. In that case your pancakes will be thicker too.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.300
The real problem is when the dough is TOO leaky, for you will not be able to take pancakes from your frying pan.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.300
But if you follow my recipe your pancakes will turn out to be  very good and rather thin.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.100
So If you want thicker pancakes -
add a little flour.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.099
Now,  set aside the dough

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.900
for half an hour at least. Put it either in the refrigerator or on the kitchen table.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.200
If your dough will stay during  the night, it'll be even better - the pancakes will be  even tastier.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.000
Some words about the pan.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It should be a special pancake fryingpan.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.900
Any diameter: I have somewhere 8.6 inches.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.000
It should be heavy.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.520
with a massive bottom in order not to burn them.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:06.200
So a massive bottom produces pancakes with a beautiful golden crust on the top.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.900
Everything, of course, depends on the type of your cooker:  gas or electric.

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:23.400
To make a story short: you should have a special frying pan for pancakes. It should be heavy with a massive bottom.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.159
And now we take the sunflower oil.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:40.200
Before baking my first pancake I cover the bottom of the pan with some oil.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.900
It will make the first pancake to be taken out of the pan easily.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.370
During the rest of the cooking process there will be no need to do it  over and over again. But it is up to you.

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:05.500
In case I bake a large number of pancakes,  I  grease the bottom with oil several times.

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.700
And now one more hint. Take a usual butter and melt it.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.100
In a microwave oven or in any other way.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:33.000
After removing each pancake from the pan,
lubricate it with butter.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.300
Do it at once. Never wait!

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.000
In  that case each pancake will be soaken with butter, never will be hard, and it will be incredibly delicious

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.100
butter gives a very delicate flavor.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.509
Now, let's make our pan hot and start the baking.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.509
Pour in the middle of the pan our dough

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:57.982
and distribute it all over the frying pan.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.400
Here's a pancake, we have received:
it is ready, and it can be removed.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.319
Greeze it with butter

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.300
and distribute the butter all over the pancake.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:18.700
Do not spare the butter, the more butter -
the tastier, softer and  tender your pancake will be.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.600
These are the pancakes we have.
As the sun!

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.000
According to your taste you can add  to the dough

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.700
a little vanilla or vanilla sugar -
It will add a smell of vanilla.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.900
If someone wants to wrap
pancakes stuffed with meat,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.349
then put a little less sugar,

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.000
if curd - then - the sweeterr, the better.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.900
Pancakes are served in any way you fancy.

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.200
Even make pancake cakes.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.080
Bon Appetit!
I think you'll like,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.800
it is a very delicious recipe, and most importantly -
you will get thin pancakes.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.300
The amount of pancakes I in my hands comes out the amount of ingredients in the list given above.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.500
I think that your family,
 will love it.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.300
