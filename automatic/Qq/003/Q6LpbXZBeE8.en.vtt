bridges that I've used before really

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.340

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
didn't sound very good to me but this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.429 
didn't sound very good to me but this
one<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> they've<00:01:38.130> come<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.780> has<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:40.200> lot

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
one that they've come up with has a lot

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.280 
one that they've come up with has a lot
of<00:01:40.470> resonance<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.270> where<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of resonance to it and I like where the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
of resonance to it and I like where the
where<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.770> resonance<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> frequency<00:01:45.299> wise

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
where the resonance is frequency wise

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
where the resonance is frequency wise
for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.810> guitar<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.470> obviously<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
for the guitar so obviously it's a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
for the guitar so obviously it's a
beautiful<00:01:48.270> guitar<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.380> if

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
beautiful guitar I know if you can if

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
beautiful guitar I know if you can if
you<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> chance<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> look<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.180> one

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you get a chance to take a look at one

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.190 
you get a chance to take a look at one
but<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> wood<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but all the wood on it the back and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.209 
but all the wood on it the back and
everything<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.329> top<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:58.219> really

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
everything and the top is really really

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
everything and the top is really really
attractive<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.170> comes<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
attractive I think it just comes in this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
attractive I think it just comes in this
one<00:02:02.310> color<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.939> very<00:02:03.240> very<00:02:03.420> cool<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
one color which is very very cool but I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.690 
one color which is very very cool but I
suppose<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.780> should<00:02:06.990> hear<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> sounds

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
suppose we should hear how it sounds

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.060 
suppose we should hear how it sounds
I'm<00:02:09.700> plugged<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.300> right<00:02:10.630> now<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:11.110> DG<00:02:11.680> 30
