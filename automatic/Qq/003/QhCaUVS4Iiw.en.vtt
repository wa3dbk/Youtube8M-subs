00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.019 
polarization and the e beam has a zero
degree<00:04:42.180> horizontal<00:04:43.020> polarization<00:04:43.909> after<00:04:44.909> the

farty<00:04:45.479> rotator<00:04:45.870> both<00:04:46.590> beams<00:04:46.979> are<00:04:47.249> rotated<00:04:47.849> a

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:47.999 
farty rotator both beams are rotated a

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:52.070 
farty rotator both beams are rotated a
45<00:04:48.509> degree<00:04:48.719> angle<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:50.340> O<00:04:50.370> beam<00:04:50.729> is<00:04:50.939> at<00:04:51.479> 45

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
45 degree angle so the O beam is at 45

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.230 
45 degree angle so the O beam is at 45
degree<00:04:52.499> and<00:04:52.740> EB<00:04:53.729> m--<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.969> at<00:04:54.389> minus<00:04:54.960> 45<00:04:55.590> degree

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.719 
degree and EB m-- is at minus 45 degree
the<00:04:57.240> output<00:04:57.719> birefringent<00:04:58.050> verge<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:59.039> cut<00:04:59.520> at

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
the output birefringent verge is cut at

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.450 
the output birefringent verge is cut at
a<00:04:59.789> different<00:05:00.210> way<00:05:00.419> than<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.870> input<00:05:01.020> veg<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:02.279> is

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
a different way than the input veg so is

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.290 
a different way than the input veg so is
opium<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.240> at<00:05:03.689> 45<00:05:04.199> degree<00:05:04.680> an<00:05:04.830> e<00:05:05.340> beam<00:05:05.550> at<00:05:05.759> minus

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
opium is at 45 degree an e beam at minus

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.800 
opium is at 45 degree an e beam at minus
45<00:05:06.779> degree<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.669> combines<00:05:08.969> these<00:05:09.389> two<00:05:09.449> beams

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
45 degree so it combines these two beams

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.890 
45 degree so it combines these two beams
back<00:05:10.229> into<00:05:10.560> one<00:05:10.770> single<00:05:11.159> beam<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:12.360> light<00:05:12.539> can

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
back into one single beam the light can

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.300 
back into one single beam the light can
continue<00:05:13.319> traveling<00:05:13.740> in<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> forward

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
continue traveling in the forward

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.330 
continue traveling in the forward
direction<00:05:15.139> now<00:05:16.139> let's<00:05:16.379> look<00:05:16.529> at<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.919> backward

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
direction now let's look at the backward

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.969 
direction now let's look at the backward
direction<00:05:18.050> Westray<00:05:19.050> was<00:05:19.229> backward<00:05:19.770> is

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
direction Westray was backward is

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.179 
direction Westray was backward is
separated<00:05:20.759> into<00:05:20.939> 45<00:05:21.629> degree<00:05:22.050> o<00:05:22.169> beam<00:05:22.529> and<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
separated into 45 degree o beam and the

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.170 
separated into 45 degree o beam and the
minus<00:05:23.550> 45<00:05:23.969> degree<00:05:24.360> B<00:05:24.539> beam<00:05:24.810> but<00:05:25.110> output<00:05:25.650> wedge

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
minus 45 degree B beam but output wedge

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.300 
minus 45 degree B beam but output wedge
then<00:05:27.180> these<00:05:27.330> two<00:05:27.569> beams<00:05:27.749> are<00:05:28.050> rotated<00:05:28.710> again<00:05:29.099> a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
then these two beams are rotated again a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.050 
then these two beams are rotated again a
45<00:05:29.819> degree<00:05:30.029> but<00:05:30.629> the<00:05:30.749> far<00:05:30.960> D<00:05:31.110> rotator<00:05:31.909> node<00:05:32.909> if

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
45 degree but the far D rotator node if

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.579 
45 degree but the far D rotator node if
you<00:05:33.180> remember<00:05:33.629> that<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:33.870> far<00:05:34.080> T<00:05:34.199> rotated

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
you remember that the far T rotated

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.709 
you remember that the far T rotated
rotates<00:05:34.919> light<00:05:35.159> in<00:05:35.430> only<00:05:35.639> one<00:05:35.969> direction<00:05:36.210> so

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
rotates light in only one direction so

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.579 
rotates light in only one direction so
now<00:05:37.529> the<00:05:37.740> O<00:05:37.889> beam<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.520> at<00:05:38.939> 0<00:05:39.479> degree<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.560> e

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
now the O beam is at 0 degree and the e

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.779 
now the O beam is at 0 degree and the e
beam<00:05:41.039> is<00:05:41.250> at<00:05:41.610> minus<00:05:42.240> 90<00:05:42.750> degree<00:05:43.279> 0<00:05:44.279> degree<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.759> a

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
beam is at minus 90 degree 0 degree is a

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.119 
beam is at minus 90 degree 0 degree is a
horizontal<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.569> then<00:05:45.930> minus<00:05:46.349> 90<00:05:46.680> degree<00:05:46.979> is

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
horizontal and then minus 90 degree is

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.659 
horizontal and then minus 90 degree is
vertical<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:49.080> here<00:05:49.289> is<00:05:49.379> the<00:05:49.500> tricky<00:05:49.770> part<00:05:49.800> to

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
vertical so here is the tricky part to

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.749 
vertical so here is the tricky part to
the<00:05:50.789> input<00:05:51.120> wedge<00:05:51.360> not<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.409> beam<00:05:52.710> becomes<00:05:53.339> is<00:05:53.550> a

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
the input wedge not a beam becomes is a

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.409 
the input wedge not a beam becomes is a
beam<00:05:54.300> since<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.050> is<00:05:55.169> at<00:05:55.379> horizontal<00:05:56.039> and<00:05:56.419> the

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
beam since it is at horizontal and the

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.629 
beam since it is at horizontal and the
e-beam<00:05:57.839> becomes<00:05:58.319> input<00:05:58.770> where<00:05:58.979> o<00:05:59.219> beam

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
e-beam becomes input where o beam

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.110 
e-beam becomes input where o beam
because<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.330> now<00:06:00.569> vertical<00:06:01.729> that<00:06:02.729> is<00:06:02.909> why

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
because it's now vertical that is why

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.950 
because it's now vertical that is why
the<00:06:03.180> far<00:06:03.539> d<00:06:03.689> rotator<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.199> chosen<00:06:04.500> at<00:06:04.770> 45<00:06:05.250> degree

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
the far d rotator is chosen at 45 degree

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.629 
the far d rotator is chosen at 45 degree
so<00:06:06.960> now<00:06:07.139> you<00:06:07.199> can<00:06:07.439> see<00:06:07.560> that<00:06:07.740> light<00:06:07.979> follow<00:06:08.399> the

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
so now you can see that light follow the

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.909 
so now you can see that light follow the
same<00:06:08.879> path<00:06:09.120> inside<00:06:09.689> the<00:06:09.870> input<00:06:10.229> wedge<00:06:10.469> the

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
same path inside the input wedge the

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.730 
same path inside the input wedge the
e-beam<00:06:11.250> follows<00:06:11.759> original<00:06:12.479> eb<00:06:12.960> m--<00:06:12.990> direction

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
e-beam follows original eb m-- direction

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.610 
e-beam follows original eb m-- direction
and<00:06:13.889> Oh<00:06:14.849> being<00:06:15.089> followed<00:06:15.479> the<00:06:15.779> original<00:06:16.500> a

being<00:06:19.889> combined<00:06:20.339> they<00:06:21.029> are<00:06:21.060> separated

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
being combined they are separated

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.399 
being combined they are separated
further<00:06:22.319> apart<00:06:23.089> since<00:06:24.089> these<00:06:24.599> two<00:06:24.899> beams<00:06:25.139> are

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
further apart since these two beams are

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.550 
further apart since these two beams are
separated<00:06:26.069> so<00:06:26.339> apart<00:06:26.759> that<00:06:27.389> they<00:06:27.719> cannot<00:06:28.139> get
