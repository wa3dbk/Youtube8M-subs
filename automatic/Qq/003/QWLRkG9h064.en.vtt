00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.510
 at this time when we have designed 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.289
 windows vista recovery cd 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.519
 I'm even wider 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.140
 and now the widest tip 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.570
 we draw the distance 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.539
 and there will be exactly the people that bellucci 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.470
 certainties. i'm watching this 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.210
 we share 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.210
 that square 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 and this is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.080
 eating seasons trike 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.340
 cut 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.160
 making themselves come out 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.330
 as it comes 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 ok 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 let's talk 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.130
 the java plates 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 and fold 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 to serve with most of the tail logo 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.770
 peter sloan English fit 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980
 in this sense here 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.290
 and before molar mass 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.540
 they talk about it right at the end 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.410
 from his sister 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.680
 idem also upward show episode

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.340
 to create your own tip man

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.070
 diamond 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 the bend of our tip should also get there by so 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.530
 from below 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.929
 massalve parma 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.139
 it appears only with a fairly thin border 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 then from fabric trials ideal 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.459
 now we prepare materials 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.769
 for the unknown 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.200
 it is a material that starts off 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.049
 to Italian breeders from the measure 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.919
 this is what prepared us the tensile test 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 because it goes beyond the fast king 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.409
 we have the insole 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.689
 then comes the triaxial fabric of the valley 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.170
 above the average carimate pultruded material I went 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.150
 and active laminate sofa 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.599
 since it is axial 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.709
 where it ends with ends up against the attack from 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.900
 our soul of the kingdom is under attack from here too 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.349
 side panels 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.560
 above wood wardrobe if you tell me 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.039
 another laminate 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.659
 who was born. 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.000
 and above all on the apple after use it soon comes to say to be starting from 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.040
 to dress 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.429

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.849
