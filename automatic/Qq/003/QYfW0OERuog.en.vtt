 kinds of houses that can buy 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.100
 Let's talk a little more about the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.200
 raffles as you are from the partners 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.489
 get but it's a good opportunity 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.609
 so that you can get a good 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.370
 price a house and now the draws 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.840
 they are very hot in the state of 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 Maryland and Virginia 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.860
 there are many draws we are 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 competing with many buyers for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.909
 that same thing you have to get advice with 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 a person who has experience is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 knows how to buy for you to benefit 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.210
 then you're going to talk about the public the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 prices are really good 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 competitive with investors that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 they are there wanting to buy these houses 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.299
 and the normal people who want 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.460
 buy and compete with them do not wait 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 that you are going to pay a little more for 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 a foreclosure like it was like before 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.640
 about two or three years ago their 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.649
 tickets were very cheap now they are 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.649
 a little more expensive for that reason 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.990
 but yes an advice from a person 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.729
 who has experience in the forum, so that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.190
 will benefit to win a good 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.509
 price per explosion and at the same time 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.060
 I assure you that we have 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.159
 connections with banks that we know that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.209
 that's why they are coming in the market 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.340
 to be able to take a step forward before 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.159
 that the competition comes for that very reason 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.709

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.210

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.340
 traditional houses that's when a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.200
