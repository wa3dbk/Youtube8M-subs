you

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.070 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.020 

you

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.339 

so<00:00:11.030> now<00:00:11.179> we're<00:00:11.420> going<00:00:11.570> to<00:00:11.660> bring<00:00:12.019> together

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
so now we're going to bring together

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.650 
so now we're going to bring together
what<00:00:12.769> you've<00:00:12.950> already<00:00:13.190> learned<00:00:13.660> linear

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
what you've already learned linear

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.900 
what you've already learned linear
perspective<00:00:14.809> circular<00:00:15.799> perspective<00:00:16.340> and

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
perspective circular perspective and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.310 
perspective circular perspective and
we're<00:00:17.029> going<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:17.210> add<00:00:17.390> into<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.840> equation

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
we're going to add into the equation

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.960 
we're going to add into the equation
scale<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.550> proportion<00:00:20.590> so<00:00:21.590> I'd<00:00:22.130> like<00:00:22.310> to<00:00:22.369> have

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
scale and proportion so I'd like to have

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.430 
scale and proportion so I'd like to have
a<00:00:23.000> look<00:00:23.119> around<00:00:23.420> find<00:00:23.689> yourself<00:00:24.080> one<00:00:24.260> or<00:00:24.350> two

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
a look around find yourself one or two

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.590 
a look around find yourself one or two
objects<00:00:24.800> like<00:00:24.980> this<00:00:25.160> aerosol<00:00:25.730> can<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.030> bottle

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
objects like this aerosol can a bottle

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.630 
objects like this aerosol can a bottle
couple<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:27.020> boxes<00:00:27.470> put<00:00:28.010> them<00:00:28.160> together<00:00:28.310> on<00:00:28.610> a

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
couple of boxes put them together on a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.490 
couple of boxes put them together on a
tray<00:00:29.000> put<00:00:29.300> them<00:00:29.420> about<00:00:29.630> six<00:00:29.990> feet<00:00:30.199> away<00:00:30.350> from

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
tray put them about six feet away from

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.069 
tray put them about six feet away from
you<00:00:30.770> on<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.920> table<00:00:31.149> sit<00:00:32.149> down<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.539> have<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> go

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
you on a table sit down and have a go

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.029 
you on a table sit down and have a go
and<00:00:33.520> then<00:00:34.690> when<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.809> come<00:00:35.960> back<00:00:36.140> we'll<00:00:36.770> move

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
and then when you come back we'll move

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.450 
and then when you come back we'll move
on<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.550> I'll<00:00:37.760> explain<00:00:38.300> how<00:00:38.359> to<00:00:38.690> set<00:00:39.199> about<00:00:39.500> the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
on and I'll explain how to set about the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.419 
on and I'll explain how to set about the
next<00:00:40.789> stage<00:00:40.999> I<00:00:43.089> always<00:00:44.089> start<00:00:44.479> with<00:00:45.429> looking

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
next stage I always start with looking

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.869 
next stage I always start with looking
for<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.600> height<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.530> width<00:00:48.739> proportion<00:00:49.699> of

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
for the height to width proportion of

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.799 
for the height to width proportion of
the<00:00:50.300> entire<00:00:50.809> group<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.329> this<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.479> where<00:00:53.659> we

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
the entire group and this is where we

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.989 
the entire group and this is where we
introduced<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.440> idea<00:00:54.799> of<00:00:54.829> measuring<00:00:55.280> using

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
introduced the idea of measuring using

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.009 
introduced the idea of measuring using
your<00:00:56.120> pencil<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:58.209> always<00:00:59.209> do<00:00:59.359> it<00:00:59.510> at<00:00:59.690> locked

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
your pencil so always do it at locked

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.289 
your pencil so always do it at locked
arm's<00:01:00.499> length<00:01:00.589> that's<00:01:01.370> an<00:01:01.549> important<00:01:02.089> point

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
arm's length that's an important point

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.420 
arm's length that's an important point
if<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:02.629> do<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.899> here<00:01:03.319> and<00:01:03.469> then<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.010> do<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.190> a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
if you do it here and then you do it a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.130 
if you do it here and then you do it a
second<00:01:04.940> time<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.150> you've<00:01:05.479> moved<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.990> little

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
second time and you've moved a little

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.289 
second time and you've moved a little
you're<00:01:06.830> going<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.220> get<00:01:07.400> problems<00:01:07.970> of

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
you're going to get problems of

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.060 
you're going to get problems of
different<00:01:08.570> proportions<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.049> always<00:01:09.350> do<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:09.950> at

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
different proportions so always do it at

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.310 
different proportions so always do it at
locked<00:01:10.280> arm's<00:01:10.640> length<00:01:10.700> hold<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.810> pencil<00:01:12.050> in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
locked arm's length hold the pencil in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.710 
locked arm's length hold the pencil in
such<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.950> way<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:13.880> move<00:01:14.150> your<00:01:14.390> thumb

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
such a way that you can move your thumb

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.620 
such a way that you can move your thumb
up<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.290> down<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.100> you're<00:01:16.340> giving<00:01:16.640> yourself<00:01:17.030> a

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
up and down so you're giving yourself a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.250 
up and down so you're giving yourself a
ruler<00:01:18.560> basically<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:20.240> what<00:01:20.630> I'm<00:01:20.780> going<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.110> do

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
ruler basically now what I'm going to do

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.190 
ruler basically now what I'm going to do
is<00:01:21.560> I'm<00:01:21.740> going<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.010> look<00:01:22.250> at<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.790> objects<00:01:23.750> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
is I'm going to look at the objects the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.930 
is I'm going to look at the objects the
group<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.800> I'm<00:01:25.010> going<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.430> make<00:01:25.670> a

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
group and I'm going to make a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.020 
group and I'm going to make a
measurement<00:01:26.740> from<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.830> two<00:01:28.130> extremes<00:01:28.760> of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
measurement from the two extremes of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.100 
measurement from the two extremes of
right<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.810> left<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:32.330> gives<00:01:32.660> me<00:01:32.780> a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
right to left and that gives me a

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.260 
right to left and that gives me a
measurement<00:01:33.770> I'm<00:01:34.100> going<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.730> take<00:01:34.940> that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
measurement I'm going to take that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.660 
measurement I'm going to take that
measurement<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.260> I'm<00:01:36.890> going<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.220> set<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
measurement and I'm going to set it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.540 
measurement and I'm going to set it
against<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.420> height<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.050> work<00:01:39.890> out<00:01:40.130> what<00:01:40.400> the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
against the height and work out what the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.480 
against the height and work out what the
height<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.850> relative<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> width<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.530> I

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
height is relative to the width and I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.160 
height is relative to the width and I
would<00:01:43.910> say<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.780> height<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:46.690> about<00:01:47.690> a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
would say that the height is about a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.380 
would say that the height is about a
fifth<00:01:48.620> greater<00:01:49.250> now<00:01:50.150> we're<00:01:51.080> going<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.380> use

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
fifth greater now we're going to use

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.730 
fifth greater now we're going to use
fractions<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> sense<00:01:54.050> but<00:01:54.200> it's

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
fractions in the sense but it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.620 
fractions in the sense but it's
basically<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.640> space<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:56.330> something

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
basically it's a space it's something

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.960 
basically it's a space it's something
it's<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.230> a<00:01:57.409> distance<00:01:57.890> e<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:58.190> need<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.550> see

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
it's it's a distance e you need to see

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.180 
it's it's a distance e you need to see
it<00:01:59.240> isn't<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.720> mathematical<00:02:00.590> equation<00:02:00.770> I'm

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
it isn't a mathematical equation I'm

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.520 
it isn't a mathematical equation I'm
saying<00:02:01.730> v<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.720> order<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.990> give<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.290> title

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
saying v so in order to give it a title

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.680 
saying v so in order to give it a title
but<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:03.979> it's<00:02:04.340> one<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.850> bit<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.479> like

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
but it's it's one and a bit if you like

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.229 
but it's it's one and a bit if you like
the<00:02:06.440> next<00:02:06.710> point<00:02:06.979> here<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.209> a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
the next point here is that this is a

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.770 
the next point here is that this is a
curved<00:02:08.659> side<00:02:09.229> on<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.950> bottle<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.909> we<00:02:11.150> need<00:02:11.659> to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
curved side on the bottle so we need to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.199 
curved side on the bottle so we need to
find<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.170> middle<00:02:12.530> now<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.099> side<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:14.060> get

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
find the middle now of the side to get

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.530 
find the middle now of the side to get
the<00:02:14.269> top<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.560> curve<00:02:15.799> that<00:02:16.430> he's<00:02:16.639> the<00:02:17.299> same

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
the top of the curve that he's the same

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.559 
the top of the curve that he's the same
point<00:02:17.870> again<00:02:18.019> as<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.889> point<00:02:19.609> of<00:02:19.909> the<00:02:20.150> gable

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
point again as the point of the gable

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.460 
point again as the point of the gable
end<00:02:20.719> of<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> wall

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
end of the wall

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.980 
end of the wall
in<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.710> middle<00:02:22.040> all<00:02:22.370> these<00:02:22.700> things<00:02:23.000> church

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
in the middle all these things church

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.140 
in the middle all these things church
windows<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.770> get<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:25.220> thing<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:26.000> must

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
windows you get the same thing you must

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
windows you get the same thing you must
get<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.320> top<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.100> rise<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.760> curve

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
get the the top of the rise of the curve

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.810 
get the the top of the rise of the curve
in<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.810> middle<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:31.190> will<00:02:31.340> curve<00:02:31.580> over

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
in the middle so that will curve over

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.350 
in the middle so that will curve over
there

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
there

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360 
there
and<00:02:32.540> come<00:02:32.870> down<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.260> side<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.250> middle

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
and come down that side in the middle

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.480 
and come down that side in the middle
there<00:02:34.730> now<00:02:35.450> we<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.750> join<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.020> up<00:02:36.490> because

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
there now we can join that up because

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.840 
there now we can join that up because
that<00:02:37.670> will<00:02:37.910> go<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.120> there<00:02:38.770> again<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.250> shoulder

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that will go to there again the shoulder

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.250 
that will go to there again the shoulder
of<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.570> sort<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.780> imagine<00:02:42.200> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
of this if you just sort of imagine it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.230 
of this if you just sort of imagine it
with<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> bit<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.710> guide<00:02:42.890> lying<00:02:43.220> there<00:02:43.520> this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
with a bit of a guide lying there this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.850 
with a bit of a guide lying there this
she's<00:02:44.420> going<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.660> come<00:02:44.840> down<00:02:45.110> there<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.800> that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
she's going to come down there like that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.030 
she's going to come down there like that
and<00:02:46.310> then<00:02:46.550> join<00:02:46.910> up<00:02:47.150> from<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> side<00:02:48.080> here<00:02:48.380> this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and then join up from the side here this

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250 
and then join up from the side here this
is<00:02:49.190> reflecting<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.060> one<00:02:50.300> coming<00:02:50.750> across<00:02:50.990> in

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
is reflecting this one coming across in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.830 
is reflecting this one coming across in
this<00:02:51.380> direction<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.510> can<00:02:53.660> put

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
this direction here and then we can put

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.500 
this direction here and then we can put
the<00:02:53.959> ellipses<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.950> by<00:02:55.610> putting<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
the ellipses on here by putting in the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.690 
the ellipses on here by putting in the
bottom<00:02:56.840> side<00:02:58.570> like<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:00.080> an<00:03:00.770> ellipse<00:03:01.400> on

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
bottom side like that and an ellipse on

bottom side like that and an ellipse on
the<00:03:02.060> top<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.510> now<00:03:05.510> I'm<00:03:05.630> going<00:03:05.840> to

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the top like that now I'm going to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
the top like that now I'm going to
expose<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.910> dia

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
expose I dia

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.620 
expose I dia
with<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:09.380> diagram<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.400> have<00:03:10.490> here<00:03:11.000> now<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.450> a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
with a diagram I have here now this is a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.300 
with a diagram I have here now this is a
church<00:03:15.020> tower<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.920> very<00:03:16.520> often<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.240> see<00:03:17.480> this

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
church tower and very often I see this

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.830 
church tower and very often I see this
mistake<00:03:19.310> made<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:22.250> church<00:03:22.640> spire<00:03:23.480> is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
mistake made that the church spire is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.440 
mistake made that the church spire is
put<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.680> middle<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> tower<00:03:25.580> sort<00:03:26.390> of

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
put in the middle of the tower sort of

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
put in the middle of the tower sort of
the<00:03:26.540> middle<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> wall<00:03:27.170> instead<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.800> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the middle of the wall instead of the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.430 
the middle of the wall instead of the
middle<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> entire<00:03:28.910> tower<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.959> works<00:03:30.170> like

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
middle of the entire tower it works like

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.210 
middle of the entire tower it works like
this<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:31.550> it's<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.030> square<00:03:32.870> tower<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:34.070> is

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
this if it's a square tower and this is

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.979 
this if it's a square tower and this is
a<00:03:34.250> plan<00:03:34.580> view<00:03:34.610> looking<00:03:35.180> straight<00:03:35.480> down<00:03:35.630> on<00:03:35.810> top

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
a plan view looking straight down on top

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.990 
a plan view looking straight down on top
of<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.280> circle<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.880> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
of it and you have the circle of the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.350 
of it and you have the circle of the
spire<00:03:38.300> if<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:39.590> are<00:03:39.680> standing<00:03:40.130> here<00:03:40.190> right<00:03:41.180> in

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
spire if you are standing here right in

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.280 
spire if you are standing here right in
the<00:03:41.510> middle<00:03:41.780> then<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.470> are<00:03:42.709> seeing<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.970> wall

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
the middle then you are seeing the wall

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.320 
the middle then you are seeing the wall
absolutely<00:03:45.290> straight<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.610> are<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.300> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
absolutely straight on so you are in the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.080 
absolutely straight on so you are in the
middle<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> center<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> spire<00:03:49.580> is<00:03:49.820> in

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
middle and the center of the spire is in

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.780 
middle and the center of the spire is in
the<00:03:50.239> middle<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.080> tower<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:52.580> if<00:03:52.670> you're

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
the middle of the tower but if you're

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.710 
the middle of the tower but if you're
standing<00:03:53.000> here<00:03:53.860> then<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.850> angle<00:03:56.450> you're

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
standing here then the angle you're

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.840 
standing here then the angle you're
seeing<00:03:57.049> is<00:03:57.290> across<00:03:57.680> from<00:03:57.739> here<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.370> here<00:03:58.670> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
seeing is across from here to here and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.650 
seeing is across from here to here and
you<00:03:59.180> this<00:03:59.620> then<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:01.190> center<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.790> not<00:04:02.030> exactly

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
you this then the center is not exactly

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.440 
you this then the center is not exactly
in<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.900> middle<00:04:03.170> it's<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.160> one<00:04:04.340> side<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.000> if

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
in the middle it's to one side and if

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.810 
in the middle it's to one side and if
you're<00:04:05.600> standing<00:04:05.840> here<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:07.100> main<00:04:07.310> thing<00:04:07.340> here

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
you're standing here the main thing here

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.250 
you're standing here the main thing here
is<00:04:07.850> remember<00:04:08.299> that<00:04:08.540> you're<00:04:08.660> not<00:04:08.690> measuring

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
is remember that you're not measuring

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.990 
is remember that you're not measuring
from<00:04:09.410> here<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.830> here<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.250> one<00:04:10.430> side<00:04:10.730> you're
