will never stop digging they'll hit and
they'll<00:01:32.659> dig<00:01:32.960> around<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.380> side<00:01:33.619> they'll<00:01:34.220> dig

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
they'll dig around the side they'll dig

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.890 
they'll dig around the side they'll dig
over<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.820> top<00:01:35.030> they'll<00:01:35.330> dig<00:01:35.479> around<00:01:35.600> this

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
over the top they'll dig around this

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.090 
over the top they'll dig around this
side<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.720> when<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.750> fill<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.140> line<00:01:39.439> coming<00:01:39.950> up

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
side so when I fill that line coming up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.670 
side so when I fill that line coming up
over<00:01:40.340> something<00:01:40.659> I'll<00:01:41.659> slow<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.259> real<00:01:42.470> down

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
over something I'll slow that real down

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.700 
over something I'll slow that real down
just<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.070> little<00:01:43.220> bit<00:01:43.780> let<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.930> hunt<00:01:45.170> around<00:01:45.350> it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
just a little bit let it hunt around it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.620 
just a little bit let it hunt around it
and<00:01:45.799> you'll<00:01:46.520> feel<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.000> bait<00:01:47.240> when<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.509> gets

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and you'll feel that bait when it gets

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.929 
and you'll feel that bait when it gets
to<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> edge<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.200> going<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.380> pop<00:01:48.560> free<00:01:48.950> now

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
to the edge it's going to pop free now

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.700 
to the edge it's going to pop free now
that's<00:01:50.150> normally<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:51.020> probably<00:01:51.320> ninety

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
that's normally that's probably ninety

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.020 
that's normally that's probably ninety
percent<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.130> time<00:01:52.340> that's<00:01:52.490> right<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:52.909> you're

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
percent of time that's right when you're

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.649 
percent of time that's right when you're
going<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.210> get<00:01:53.329> bit<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.850> other<00:01:55.970> ten<00:01:56.240> percent

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
going to get bit the other ten percent

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.090 
going to get bit the other ten percent
you're<00:01:56.960> not<00:01:57.140> going<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.380> get<00:01:57.530> bit<00:01:57.710> right<00:01:57.920> then

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
you're not going to get bit right then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.819 
you're not going to get bit right then
when<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.030> pops<00:01:59.270> free<00:01:59.600> I'll<00:02:00.140> speed<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.619> real

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829

the problem with the slow reels is is if

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.970 
the problem with the slow reels is is if
you<00:02:53.750> were<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.109> in<00:02:54.230> my<00:02:54.349> boat<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.739> me<00:02:54.859> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
you were to get in my boat with me and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.190 
you were to get in my boat with me and
stand<00:02:55.220> here<00:02:55.370> side<00:02:55.579> by<00:02:55.609> side<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.930> would<00:02:57.079> go

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
stand here side by side and we would go

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.119 
stand here side by side and we would go
down<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.500> bank<00:02:59.500> we'd<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.859> down<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
down the bank we'd be going down the

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.860 
down the bank we'd be going down the
bank<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:01.519> fast<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.209> would<00:03:02.359> throw<00:03:02.599> make<00:03:02.840> a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
bank so fast and you would throw make a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.830 
bank so fast and you would throw make a
cast<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.560> with<00:03:03.829> that<00:03:03.950> slow<00:03:04.250> real<00:03:04.720> you'd<00:03:05.720> be

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
cast and with that slow real you'd be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.349 
cast and with that slow real you'd be
winding<00:03:06.200> as<00:03:06.349> fast<00:03:06.620> as<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.859> can<00:03:07.159> and<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.549> would

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
winding as fast as you can and you would

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.970 
winding as fast as you can and you would
watch<00:03:08.569> your<00:03:08.750> crank<00:03:08.959> bait<00:03:09.139> float<00:03:09.439> by<00:03:09.620> because

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
watch your crank bait float by because

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.140 
watch your crank bait float by because
it<00:03:10.129> would<00:03:10.250> never<00:03:10.430> get<00:03:10.639> under<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:10.969> surface

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
it would never get under the surface

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.819 
it would never get under the surface
that's<00:03:11.480> how<00:03:11.599> fast<00:03:11.810> we'd<00:03:12.049> be<00:03:12.230> covering<00:03:12.590> water

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
that's how fast we'd be covering water

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.610 
that's how fast we'd be covering water
and<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:14.480> all<00:03:14.659> started<00:03:15.169> because<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:17.510> these<00:03:17.930> flw

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
and it all started because in these flw

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.949 
and it all started because in these flw
tournaments<00:03:19.129> we<00:03:19.609> get<00:03:19.819> pre<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:20.689> four<00:03:20.930> days

tournaments we get pre we get four days

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.589 
tournaments we get pre we get four days

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.360 
practice like your fish in it you know I
started<00:03:51.409> practice<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:51.949> that<00:03:52.069> way<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.310> I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
started practice in that way and I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.559 
started practice in that way and I
started<00:03:52.639> catching<00:03:52.790> fish<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.359> way<00:03:53.509> and

started catching fish that way and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:54.729 
started catching fish that way and
that's<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.900> way<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.139> have<00:03:54.379> to<00:03:54.530> fish<00:03:54.709> a

that's the way you have to fish a
tournament<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.400> that's<00:03:55.939> just<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.329> way<00:03:56.449> i
