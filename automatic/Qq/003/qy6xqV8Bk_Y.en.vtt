00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.210
 valid for the group n championship therefore 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.950
 the production machine 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.290

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.689
 sampled more probably 12 more 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.210
 to find feeling with the car 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.010
 because it is very very office with six 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.239
 years will resume everything right 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.280
 they are new so everything has changed 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
 first of all it blends passages for me is 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.940
 been challenging because the first time 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.280
 that we do 1 sweden and then come back 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.710
 after six years there are a thousand unexpected events 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.710
 we see at the end of the race and what we conclude 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.630

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.879

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.970

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.090

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.740
 why he made a terrible effort 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.440
 he managed to get to the bottom without a 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.320
 scratch the car and keep the 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.480
 right concentration for gabbo six years 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.820
