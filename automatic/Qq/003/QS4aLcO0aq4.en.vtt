00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
quite few fights but I think why people

bundle and I'm going for that prediction
as<00:00:14.910> well<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> think<00:00:15.210> he<00:00:15.450> then<00:00:15.599> was<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.809> to

ring with Frankie Gavin come on really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
ring with Frankie Gavin come on really
and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.009> thing<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and the thing is this right the thing is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.830 
and the thing is this right the thing is
this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> stylistically<00:01:20.600> bundu<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.720> an

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this is that stylistically bundu is an

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810 
this is that stylistically bundu is an
easier<00:01:22.110> fight<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.500> Thurman<00:01:22.860> stylistically

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
easier fight for Thurman stylistically

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
easier fight for Thurman stylistically
and<00:01:24.299> gummy<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.689> Gavin's<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.140> mover<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and gummy because Gavin's a mover and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
and gummy because Gavin's a mover and
maybe<00:01:26.340> Thurman<00:01:26.640> much<00:01:26.790> took<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.180> bit

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
maybe Thurman much took a little bit

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
maybe Thurman much took a little bit
without<00:01:27.420> he's<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> struggle

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
without he's not going to struggle

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.330 
without he's not going to struggle
against<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.549> come<00:01:29.790> forward<00:01:30.150> slowish<00:01:30.780> fire<00:01:31.340> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
against a come forward slowish fire like

against a come forward slowish fire like
undo<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:33.270> Julio<00:01:33.540> Diaz<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> bundled

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
undo I think Julio Diaz would be bundled

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
undo I think Julio Diaz would be bundled
to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.310> honest<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.939> even<00:01:36.210> though<00:01:36.299> the

but<00:01:41.220> under<00:01:42.000> India's<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> would<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:42.869> Diaz

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but under India's I would go for Diaz

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
but under India's I would go for Diaz
