00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.490
 What the hell is Rodrigo Gomes talking about? 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.980
 professional skater today is here at 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.900
 my ramp in Atibaia 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.880
 I will do some images began before 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.820
 crisis we will see what will happen what 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.349
 missing maggi felt is having more championship 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.689
 the media suddenly invest a little 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.880
 but the government has received enough 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.770
 public runways being built but 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 so the wrong way then all of a sudden 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.150
 time for a public mass 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.739
 take a little more seriously and make the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.570
 right thing because so new 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.420
 practitioners do not appear the Basque with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.790
 Corruption certainty not only disturbs niche 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.470
 but I think that certainly in Brazil 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.810
 whole in all sports are the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.950
 structure of the country is bad and it 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.480
 the staff just invested in the sport 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.670
 Because of that, I think that with 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.970
 sure that he even had corruption and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.799
 sure Brazil would be better and 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.020
 more investments in skate sports 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.090
 on tracks in brands and encouraging more 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.040
 that I think corruption does not lead to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 nothing and certainly had the means 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.250
 next 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.180
 I think the manifestations that are 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.630
 happening legal too 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.000
 the peaceful demonstration of course I think 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.979
 that as I said I think Brazil is a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.619
 country that pays a lot of tax and does not have the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 it deserves so I think this is the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.340
 people as it really woke up now 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.960
 with the release on the internet everyone 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.320
 know what is happening 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.119
 then the NagÃ´ goal people I was with 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 a lot of things going wrong 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.770
 in the area of football now with the cup 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.549
 world many robberies then the staff was 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.840
 to the street 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.149
 I think it 's worth claiming. 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.280
 for your rights, I think for sure. 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.330
 Brazil deserves health sports 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.789
 schools, then more security with 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.819
 sure that today is very dangerous to walk 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.280
 In Brazil, I think that these 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.200
 demonstrations are welcome and will 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.310
 just one day we'll end up 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.310
 getting here 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.030
 Good thing I think this is it. 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.430
 I talked a little more about the demonstrations 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.690
 sports politics I think we 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.209
 is on the right track Brazil 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.400
 finally woke up then 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.049
 So in this footprint and growing 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.640
 enough to continue in this 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.829
 footprint helping to forget and trying to 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 help at least by competing by doing 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.730
 more events here 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.810
 saw then let's go on now let's go 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.810
 watch a little hot
