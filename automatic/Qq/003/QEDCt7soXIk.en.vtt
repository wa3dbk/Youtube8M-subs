00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.990
 m 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.840
 oh no not again in minecraft 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.550
 wage 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 that was my first thoughts as me 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 I've seen this game I'm against 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 syntax clear down from german gamer 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.449
 society and today I want you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 Discovery introduce the whole game 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.730
 There is currently still free on the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 windows 8 store and is just 19 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 megabyte big it runs relatively smoothly 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.820
 it's just mine now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 recording program that so jerky and 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.379
 it definitely promises one 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 he does not look bombastic now 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.180
 so much of it I have a lot 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.640
 edge flicker 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.710
 a little bit everywhere on the corners 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.310
 antje leißing really would have the game 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.930
 not hurt 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 otherwise I have to say graphically 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.640
 It looks like an early version of 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.500
 minecraft with a medium classic 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 texture pack I can not own one here 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.460
 I can not install text apex 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.790
 mods install that it all 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.860
 twitter through windows 8 you have to 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.260
 play as it is I must 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.310
 Really say in the stand I like it 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.750
 not really that good yet 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.850
 yes, I'll just show you like one 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 explosion looks a bit more colorful 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.440
 we at the original minecraft but also 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 I have to do that, I do not know 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.479
 I do not necessarily think so now 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.160
 bringer 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.090
 I have a few blocks but by far 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.820
 not as much as the original 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.520
 minecraft but identical to that 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 original minecraft so i find here 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 no new blocks except these triangles 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.520
 but there is certainly one too 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.240
 murder 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.240
 Yes 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.560
 otherwise 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.320
 I have now also often times so 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.850
 buck that I'm here now only with 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.080
 the mouse can run 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.670
 Now everything works 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.450
 again as it is still a bit 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.220
 packed but I think the whole thing 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.930
 will still be working in the course of 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 time if I read that correctly 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.079
 I do not like the block selection 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.420
 have two modes run around once and 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:56.560
 Once I have monster flying up 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 not seen yet 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.270
 it is definitely just for me 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.990
 a cheap clown admittedly the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.880
 background music I like even the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.800
 Soundscape is so from the footsteps 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.990
 a bit better as well 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.460
 minecraft but also there is 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.440
 again for the reason i can 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.150
 Definitely only who say no money for 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.140
 minecraft has for sure 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.500
 a good game 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.110
 who wants to play a bit of lego 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.120
 the computer but for all others the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.720
 either minecraft already own or 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.970
 20 euro would rather play minecraft 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.320
 we already have that in our own country 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.990
 programmed then you can also like 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.300
 where he also uses graphics for example 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.650
 and sound mods automatically installed 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.720
 gets on a budget without any problems 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.180
 server joins can be without the always or 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.000
 Minecraft will downgrade that is always 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.410
 everything set correctly 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.450
 and if you are still looking for that 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.760
 clear since and over 18 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.680
 We are always looking for clan members 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.280
 even in the area of ​​minecraft if there is someone 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.080
 would like to build with us is not a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.290
 problem with us to come in as long as 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.090
 the level is available yes 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.180
 I will become minecraft lancia in itself 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.340
 link again in the description 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.250
 just like our team where he left 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.170
 can watch our team and also 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.050
 the address under which you are with us 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.520
 in the clear can apply otherwise 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.560
 Do not buy this game if it is 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.260
 sometimes it will be worth paying 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.410
 definitely not it's really just one 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.320
 brash copy of minecraft all the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.110
 great things like redstone the mods 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.420
 texter packs everything not available 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.910
