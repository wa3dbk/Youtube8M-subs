this unsalted margarine is not always
easy<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.470> find<00:01:22.750> but<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.020> really<00:01:24.380> makes<00:01:24.590> a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
easy to find but it really makes a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.719 
easy to find but it really makes a
difference<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:27.140> consistency<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.310> find<00:01:28.580> it

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
difference in the consistency I find it

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.359 
difference in the consistency I find it
when<00:01:28.909> it's<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.150> butter<00:01:29.720> it's<00:01:30.650> just<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.070> little

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
when it's just butter it's just a little

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.510 
when it's just butter it's just a little
bit<00:01:31.550> runny<00:01:31.910> er<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.250> buttercream<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.430> it

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
bit runny er the buttercream and it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.980 
bit runny er the buttercream and it
doesn't<00:01:34.790> give<00:01:34.910> me<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.090> nice<00:01:35.240> peak<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:35.780> here

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
doesn't give me a nice peak so here

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
doesn't give me a nice peak so here
we're<00:01:36.110> at<00:01:36.200> 605<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.130> that's<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.909> be<00:01:38.000> fine

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270

so they're and now I'm at 6:46 so is

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.100 
so they're and now I'm at 6:46 so is
that<00:02:22.760> 30<00:02:23.120> grams<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:24.010> corn<00:02:25.010> syrup<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:26.450> before<00:02:27.079> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that 30 grams of corn syrup now before I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.350 
that 30 grams of corn syrup now before I
add<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.650> powdered<00:02:28.040> sugar<00:02:28.070> I'm<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.150> whip

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
add the powdered sugar I'm going to whip

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.890 
add the powdered sugar I'm going to whip
this<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:30.110> bit<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.680> my<00:02:30.950> KitchenAid

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500 

I<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.739> mix<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.280> fact<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.849> corns

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
I just like to mix the fact that corns

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.210 
I just like to mix the fact that corns
here<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:39.610> vanilla<00:02:39.879> together<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
here and the vanilla together and it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820 
here and the vanilla together and it
seems<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.909> avoid<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.659> whole<00:02:43.930> cloud<00:02:44.379> business

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
seems to avoid this whole cloud business

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
start it at one or two just to get the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.440 
start it at one or two just to get the
ingredients<00:03:53.470> mixed<00:03:53.980> together<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.700> then<00:03:55.239> you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
ingredients mixed together and then you

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.420 
ingredients mixed together and then you
can<00:03:55.599> increase<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.200> speed<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.769> actually<00:03:57.130> whip

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
can increase the speed to actually whip

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.479 
can increase the speed to actually whip
the<00:03:58.330> icing

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.349 

this<00:04:03.060> process<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:04.079> take<00:04:04.280> 4<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.370> 15<00:04:05.579> minutes

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
this process can take 4 to 15 minutes

this process can take 4 to 15 minutes
the<00:04:06.689> whole<00:04:06.870> thing<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.409> mix<00:04:07.590> everything

mixer mixing something like this you can

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.529 
mixer mixing something like this you can
blow<00:04:18.449> your<00:04:18.479> motor<00:04:19.340> you're<00:04:20.340> using<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:21.209> on<00:04:21.329> it's

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
you can see the cloud of powdered sugar

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.080 
you can see the cloud of powdered sugar
coming<00:04:33.330> out<00:04:33.449> here<00:04:34.099> if<00:04:35.099> I<00:04:35.280> hide<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.699> at<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:35.820> higher

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
coming out here if I hide it at a higher

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.659 
coming out here if I hide it at a higher
speed<00:04:36.419> I'd<00:04:36.750> have<00:04:37.050> white<00:04:37.800> powder<00:04:38.099> all<00:04:38.430> over<00:04:38.460> my

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669

black surface for sure so mixing the fat
the<00:04:45.720> beginning<00:04:46.080> seems<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:47.009> have<00:04:47.849> this

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
the beginning seems to just have this

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.020 
the beginning seems to just have this
process<00:04:48.449> go<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.320> bit<00:04:49.650> smoother<00:04:50.610> than<00:04:50.880> if

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
process go a little bit smoother than if

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.110 
process go a little bit smoother than if
we<00:04:51.210> had<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> big<00:04:51.780> clump<00:04:52.199> of<00:04:52.490> butter<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.789> mix<00:04:54.000> with

we had a big clump of butter to mix with
the<00:04:54.270> margarine<00:04:55.370> now<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.400> can<00:04:56.789> see<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.180> getting

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
the margarine now I can see it's getting

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.840 
the margarine now I can see it's getting
kind<00:04:59.220> of
