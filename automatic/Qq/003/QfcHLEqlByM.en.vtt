00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
instead of square feet this time you'll

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
instead of square feet this time you'll
simply<00:01:21.720> add<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.259> lengths<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> each<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
simply add the lengths of each side and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.899 
simply add the lengths of each side and
divide<00:01:24.030> by<00:01:24.240> 12<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.439> 48<00:01:26.070> plus<00:01:26.729> 24<00:01:27.450> plus<00:01:28.259> 24

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
divide by 12 so 48 plus 24 plus 24

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.420 
divide by 12 so 48 plus 24 plus 24
divided<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.030> 12<00:01:30.500> equals<00:01:31.500> 8<00:01:31.740> linear<00:01:32.130> feet<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
divided by 12 equals 8 linear feet of
