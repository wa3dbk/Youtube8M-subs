 Pilgrim group leader Andrei Kovalev 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.680

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.490
 Andrei rides a motorcycle from the age of 15 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.220
 among his friends are not many bikers 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.560
 important who are you in that life banker minister 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.030
 have there own scale of values which then 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.430
 honest and correct scale 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.530
 so here I am this biker freestyle 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.530

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.510
 cool cartoon rulitsya perfect 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.580
 the speed switches very clearly 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.300
 power felt on the handle stock 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.190
 a huge plus I look and ps is 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.500
 really liked the very Kovalev in 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 garage 4 first-class bike one of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.940
 which made to order 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 but it all started with java now it's like 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.050
 little moped of course when i 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 transplanting two-liter space 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.000
 in reality 350 rug earlier it seemed 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.220
 which is unreal of course fun 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.220
 sits on a perch so narrow 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
 cool company 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.629
 certainly very nimble 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.349
 it is very easy to sneak cork on it 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.300
 mean car car but for 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.190
 feel the brush easily watt not 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.709
 I want to be heavier before letting down 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 totals and put the estimates of the two apparatus 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.260
 Andrei Kovalev addressed to all 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.860
 motorcyclists 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.720
 guys let's ride quietly 60 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.510
 frames per hour is enough 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.549
 pleasure and have time to notice beautiful 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.450
 a girl drive up not meet a 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.870
 Now estimates hondi their army means 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.849
 surely this is a higher product 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.680
 technology is more modern 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.690
 motorcycle 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.069
 from nesba on it you get pleasure 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.329
 more it is more so rough tough 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.480
 more brutal motorcycle 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.150
 but here of course there is charisma here 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.099
 still no charisma here so smooth 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.239
 quietly comfortable and pleasant in two fives 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.239
 two fives but different
