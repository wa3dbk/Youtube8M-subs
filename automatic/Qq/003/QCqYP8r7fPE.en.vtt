the<00:04:40.430> new<00:04:40.610> HD<00:04:41.000> stuff<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.420> started<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.020> see<00:04:42.200> like

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
the new HD stuff I started to see like

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.320 
the new HD stuff I started to see like
we<00:04:42.980> could<00:04:43.160> really<00:04:43.340> do<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.460> lot<00:04:43.550> with<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.090> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
we could really do a lot with this a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.330 
we could really do a lot with this a
credit<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.900> filmmakers<00:04:45.350> is<00:04:45.530> on<00:04:46.160> their

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
credit to the filmmakers is on their

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.280 
credit to the filmmakers is on their
previous<00:04:46.520> film<00:04:46.940> step<00:04:47.210> into<00:04:47.390> liquid<00:04:47.510> they<00:04:48.140> had

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
previous film step into liquid they had

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.440 
previous film step into liquid they had
already<00:04:48.470> done<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:49.070> HD<00:04:49.790> digital<00:04:50.060> intermediate

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
already done in HD digital intermediate

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.870 
already done in HD digital intermediate
on<00:04:50.870> d5<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:51.950> they<00:04:52.220> already<00:04:52.370> had<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.610> confidence

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
on d5 so they already had the confidence

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.100 
on d5 so they already had the confidence
of<00:04:53.090> saying<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.390> know<00:04:53.480> what<00:04:53.510> we're

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
of saying you know what we're

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.750 
of saying you know what we're
comfortable<00:04:54.470> printing<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.890> film<00:04:55.100> from<00:04:55.400> an<00:04:55.460> HD

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
comfortable printing to film from an HD

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.000 
comfortable printing to film from an HD
frame<00:04:56.060> that's<00:04:57.050> not<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> problem<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.920> I<00:04:57.980> think

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
frame that's not a problem and I think

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.350 
frame that's not a problem and I think
that's<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.490> biggest<00:04:58.640> hurdle<00:04:58.970> for<00:04:59.060> people<00:04:59.300> to

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
that's the biggest hurdle for people to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.480 
that's the biggest hurdle for people to
get<00:04:59.450> over<00:04:59.630> but<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.290> second<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.680> get<00:05:01.130> through

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
get over but the second you get through

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.980 
get over but the second you get through
it<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.790> you<00:05:02.060> see<00:05:02.300> how<00:05:02.510> much<00:05:02.600> creative

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
it and you see how much creative

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.600 
it and you see how much creative
liberties<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.470> have<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:04.070> then<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.370> see<00:05:04.490> that

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
liberties you have and then you see that

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.370 
liberties you have and then you see that
finished<00:05:04.880> result<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.780> kind<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.110> a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
finished result it's kind of a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.230 
finished result it's kind of a
no-brainer<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:07.550> was<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.850> matter<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.060> doing

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
no-brainer it was just a matter of doing

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.970 
no-brainer it was just a matter of doing
some<00:05:08.450> tests<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.110> then<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.650> matter<00:05:09.860> of

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
some tests and then a matter of

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.610 
some tests and then a matter of
problem-solving<00:05:10.750> at<00:05:11.750> each<00:05:11.930> point<00:05:12.200> along<00:05:12.320> the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
problem-solving at each point along the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.140 
problem-solving at each point along the
way<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.280> know<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.550> first<00:05:13.730> thing<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:14.000> deal

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
way you know the first thing you deal

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.240 
way you know the first thing you deal
with<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.420> you<00:05:14.510> get<00:05:14.630> an<00:05:14.720> EDL<00:05:15.080> from<00:05:15.770> your<00:05:15.950> offline

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
with is you get an EDL from your offline

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.610 
with is you get an EDL from your offline
at<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.610> that's<00:05:16.820> 2997<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:18.110> you're<00:05:18.320> finishing

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
at it that's 2997 and you're finishing

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460 
at it that's 2997 and you're finishing
at<00:05:18.860> 23<00:05:19.280> 9<00:05:19.460> 8<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.240> how<00:05:20.390> do<00:05:20.450> you<00:05:20.600> parse<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.110> edl

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
at 23 9 8 so how do you parse the edl

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.650 
at 23 9 8 so how do you parse the edl
how<00:05:21.770> do<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.040> batch<00:05:22.550> capture<00:05:23.090> footage<00:05:23.300> that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
how do you batch capture footage that

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.990 
how do you batch capture footage that
doesn't<00:05:24.050> exist<00:05:24.260> in<00:05:24.440> 24<00:05:24.830> frame<00:05:25.010> time<00:05:25.280> code<00:05:25.550> so

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
doesn't exist in 24 frame time code so

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.610 
doesn't exist in 24 frame time code so
that<00:05:26.030> was<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.450> first<00:05:26.660> obstacle<00:05:26.960> then<00:05:27.500> the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
that was the first obstacle then the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.130 
that was the first obstacle then the
next<00:05:27.770> obstacle<00:05:28.130> is<00:05:28.550> color<00:05:28.850> space<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.780> know<00:05:29.900> up

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
next obstacle is color space you know up

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.560 
next obstacle is color space you know up
converting<00:05:30.620> multiple<00:05:31.340> formats<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.330> forth

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
converting multiple formats and so forth

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.600 
converting multiple formats and so forth
but<00:05:32.870> basically<00:05:33.170> just<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.500> ability<00:05:33.920> you<00:05:34.100> know

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
but basically just the ability you know

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.190 
but basically just the ability you know
to<00:05:34.670> have<00:05:34.910> an<00:05:35.060> editorial<00:05:35.570> tool<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:35.990> allowed

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
to have an editorial tool that allowed

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.290 
to have an editorial tool that allowed
us<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.380> use<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.830> high<00:05:36.980> on<00:05:37.130> formats<00:05:37.520> we<00:05:38.120> can

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
us to use the high on formats we can

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.690 
us to use the high on formats we can
bring<00:05:38.810> everything<00:05:39.560> in<00:05:39.920> we<00:05:40.310> can<00:05:40.460> spit

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
bring everything in we can spit

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.920 
bring everything in we can spit
everything<00:05:41.030> back<00:05:41.180> out<00:05:41.420> we<00:05:41.630> can<00:05:41.750> communicate

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
everything back out we can communicate

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.590 
everything back out we can communicate
to<00:05:42.320> after<00:05:42.620> effects<00:05:42.920> and<00:05:43.160> vice<00:05:43.550> versa<00:05:43.880> again

export<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:17.800> film<00:06:18.069> and<00:06:18.310> that's<00:06:19.000> a<00:06:19.210> huge

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
export to film and that's a huge

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.360 
export to film and that's a huge
advantage<00:06:19.599> once<00:06:20.199> again<00:06:20.500> really<00:06:21.190> really

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
advantage once again really really

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.339 
advantage once again really really
cost-effective<00:06:21.940> way<00:06:22.419> of<00:06:22.629> ending<00:06:22.870> up<00:06:23.050> with<00:06:23.110> all

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
cost-effective way of ending up with all

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.469 
cost-effective way of ending up with all
your<00:06:23.500> deliverables<00:06:23.949> but<00:06:24.940> if<00:06:25.030> you<00:06:25.090> look<00:06:25.240> at<00:06:25.360> the

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
your deliverables but if you look at the

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.870 
your deliverables but if you look at the
entire<00:06:25.780> film<00:06:26.289> festival<00:06:26.919> process<00:06:27.370> I<00:06:27.520> think<00:06:27.550> it
