different types of sea ice there's the

annually<00:01:38.930> with<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> seasons<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.250> generally

annually with the seasons it's generally

annually with the seasons it's generally
decreases<00:01:41.479> in<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.020> summer<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.470> increases<00:01:43.340> in

decreases in the summer and increases in

decreases in the summer and increases in
the<00:01:43.550> winter<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.240> maximum<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.870> we<00:01:45.020> show

the winter so the maximum that we show
it<00:01:46.070> usually<00:01:46.400> occurs<00:01:46.460> sometime<00:01:47.150> around<00:01:47.300> March

multi-year ice is ice that has been

multi-year ice is ice that has been
frozen<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.380> up<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.830> two<00:01:52.040> summers<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.760> that<00:01:53.659> is

frozen for up to two summers and that is

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.230 
frozen for up to two summers and that is
generally<00:01:54.530> more<00:01:54.890> stable<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.549> doesn't<00:01:55.940> change

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
generally more stable and doesn't change

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.390 
generally more stable and doesn't change
as<00:01:56.450> much<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.650> studies<00:01:58.010> have<00:01:58.130> shown<00:01:58.159> that

as much but the studies have shown that

in<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> Arctic<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.570> doesn't<00:02:14.960> cause<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.470> impact

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
in the Arctic it doesn't cause an impact

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.420 
in the Arctic it doesn't cause an impact
of<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.880> Arctic<00:02:17.210> region<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.860> gonna<00:02:19.160> be
