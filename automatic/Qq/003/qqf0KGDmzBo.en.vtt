00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi to all and skyrock how are you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.490
 although today a new 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.620
 video on call of duty ghost and this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 this time sniper us air on the map strike 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.010
 zone in death match that's small 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 pretty nice gameplay pretty posed 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.340
 with monkey strict specialists a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 class also pretty classic on this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 I usually use snipers 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.109
 if you want a little more detail 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.359
 compared to that I did a tutorial 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 sniper to start the snipe on ghost 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.170
 is also my classes so if you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.430
 want a little more to deepen a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.779
 little bit the thing invites you to them 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 look but today I wanted 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009
 to make an announcement even rather several 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 detailed ads a little bit set 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.100
 day on on what am I doing around 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.980
 my activity be it double or 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 something else so firstly the announced 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 I set up a website of which 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 the link will be in the description I you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.390
 invite to watch it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.350
 what will happen on this site 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 then will be two main things 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.260
 firstly cod actuality 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.399
 actually I think you have 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.010
 noticed it's been a while since 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.640
 I did not make the correct cod diary 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 to say there is not much 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.370
 very important information 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.020
 currently I think everyone 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.640
 is a little bit in the game a little 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 little even in the new consoles the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.970
 other games that have just been released etc 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.650
 there is not really much to say 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.240
 I 'm good I did not do it either 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.540
 a video for nothing just to brew 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.939
 the wind 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 and precisely with respect to that so 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.979
 the news coding on this this will serve to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 to put in time all 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 news that will be for me I think 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.009
 important facts about call of duty 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.000
 here is boom directly on the site because 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.470
 that it is true that if there is a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 information that will be on Tuesday me I 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.950
 do the diary of it is audel sunday 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.720
 good training and then really very 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.070
 very new so that's it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.020
 now ten cases an info that goes 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 go out boom I would put the info on the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.140
 site like that I invite you to go 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 see the site regularly to see s 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.350
 which is small info or if you are asking 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.579
 issues including often there are the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.040
 updates so I'll try to 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.470
 to put in detail in French what is it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 that included this update there and for 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 all information about call of duty 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 for the cod diary I will do less 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.880
 frequently I will do less every 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.439
 Sundays I would really do it when that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.149
 will be needed when there is really 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 big things to explain detailed or 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.420
 at that time using the avs of a 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.680
 video is still a lot more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.719
 simple in him saying it 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.430
 and of course the link will be in 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.990
 the news is ed of the website 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.849
 so that's in addition to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.220
 cod log information the site 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.330
 internet with cod news to see 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.920
 in due course what has happened 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.510
 past what is the news and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.770
 secondly important things about this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.960
 site there for which it was designed 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.220
 initially it's to make live 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.690
 I think you are a little bit 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.190
 familiar now because a lot of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 people do it and that's right it's 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.970
 much simpler like that even though 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.470
 youtube allows us to make life 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.410
 it's not terrible we do not have a good 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.360
 quality and it's a bit difficult to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.520
 do he advertise there at my request not bad 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.230
 that's a lot simpler 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 whether for me or for you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.710
 visually or to set it up 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.930
 thanks to the website 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.580
 so we could integrate the player of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.200
 dailymotion with which one can really 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.959
 stream is easily and with a 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.480
 best quality and twitch cat 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.250
 with which we can really speak that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.709
 you can ask your question 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.270
 interact in the live and me you 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.820
 answer a lot more easily so 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.930
 all this is a bit of a best-of of everything 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.730
 what is best in the site 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.380
 internet so that finally live 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.110
 much simpler a lot more 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.910
 friendly is much more pleasant to 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.930
 the view for everyone here is in 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.340
 hoping that you like it is true 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 that it had been asked me a lot of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.410
 times so that's been put in place 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.360
 thanks to the help of aes design 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.790
 whose kim designed the base of the site 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 internet making websites 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.850
 but who also does not that that has 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.860
 a youtube channel and that makes 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.239
 co-op centro videos especially in this 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.930
 moment that is a series that is nice 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.580

 so here's this website for 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.019
 the moment it's not over it's 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.239
 just a base on how I 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.519

 opinion this is really very very 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.970
 important this back there to improve a 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.500
 maximum all the positives all 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.299
 the negatives what you think 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.489
 that they could be improved added 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.560
 or even removed anything any 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.239
 ideas that you have do not hesitate to the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.489
 say on this video the by comment 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.470
 all this is really an ultra being 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.269
 precious and I will really read the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.100
 comments thoroughly to try 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.420
 finally from this site which today 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.040
 good as I said it's that it's 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.900
 that a base as well as the beginning and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.790
 try to improve it and finally 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.950
 do something that is really 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.049
 well here is the top try a maximum of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.609
 to do something awesome so for 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.530
 the cod diary I will do less 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.720
 regularly as a game 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.360
 fresh jeans when it will be needed and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.450
 to replace substitute clicks of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.950
 subscribers so I will do every Sunday 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.510

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.970
 am more in the field of snipe and

 comments all the feedback is very 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.169
 important and in any case for me is 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.450
 very important so thanks to all in all 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.039
 case of having watched the video and 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.419
 hoping that eventually all of this will be 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.490
 be good stumbling is full of good 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.289
 things in the future and everything is happening 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.210
 a little green thumb that also 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.440
 it's the reward it's 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.510
 motivates each time a little bit to say 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.740
 bad it rained it motivates if you do not 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.660
 not like you can always put a 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.310
 inch roujas pretty free to you and me 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.840
 it shows behind that finally down there
