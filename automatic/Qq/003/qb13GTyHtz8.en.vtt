00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
today in my video blog I'm going to talk

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.870 
today in my video blog I'm going to talk
a<00:00:06.150> little<00:00:06.390> bit<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.170> laser<00:00:07.760> there<00:00:08.760> is

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
a little bit about the laser there is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660 
a little bit about the laser there is
some<00:00:09.030> information<00:00:09.260> on<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.800> laser<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.610> my

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
some information on this laser on my

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.999 
some information on this laser on my
website<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:13.110> nice<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> point<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:13.889> some

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
website but it's nice to point out some

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.320 
website but it's nice to point out some
things<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.340> person<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.150> help

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
things in person here and it will help

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.570 
things in person here and it will help
you<00:00:15.420> understand<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:15.990> bit<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
you understand a little bit about the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.890 
you understand a little bit about the
beauty<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> also<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.300> challenges<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
beauty of it and also the challenges of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.540 
beauty of it and also the challenges of
it<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> why<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.590> makes<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.949> treating<00:00:20.250> photos

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it and why it makes that treating photos

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.820 
it and why it makes that treating photos
so<00:00:20.730> difficult<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> YAG<00:00:22.590> laser

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
so difficult so this is the YAG laser

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759 
so difficult so this is the YAG laser
it's<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.100> FDA<00:00:23.550> approved<00:00:24.180> laser<00:00:24.500> for<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> number

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it's an FDA approved laser for a number

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
it's an FDA approved laser for a number
of<00:00:25.800> purposes<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> guts<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> laser<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:28.080> in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of purposes the guts of the laser are in

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
of purposes the guts of the laser are in
this<00:00:28.289> unit<00:00:28.619> right<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.039> these<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this unit right here these are the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
this unit right here these are the
optics<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.289> orient<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
optics this is what I use to orient you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
optics this is what I use to orient you
I<00:00:32.550> work<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.329> side<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> patient<00:00:34.230> has

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I work at this side the patient has

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
I work at this side the patient has
their<00:00:34.469> head<00:00:34.680> settled<00:00:35.610> into<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.090> against

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
their head settled into here against

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
their head settled into here against
this<00:00:36.870> cushion<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.710> they've<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.340> strap<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this cushion here they've got a strap to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.180 
this cushion here they've got a strap to
hold<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> fixation<00:00:40.890> line

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
hold them in I also have a fixation line

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.440 
hold them in I also have a fixation line
so<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> eye<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:42.000> being<00:00:42.210> treated

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so the eye that's not being treated

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
so the eye that's not being treated
that's<00:00:43.020> something<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that's something to look at and if I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.619 
that's something to look at and if I
move<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.090> direction<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.600> another

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
move this from one direction to another

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
move this from one direction to another
both<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> eyes<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.980> move<00:00:47.070> together<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
both of the eyes will move together and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
both of the eyes will move together and
they<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.000> put<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.300> eye<00:00:48.329> into<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> position

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
they can put that eye into the position

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.580 
they can put that eye into the position
that<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:51.289> probably<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> most

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
that we want it to probably the most

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
that we want it to probably the most
critical<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> convey<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
critical thing I can convey here is that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500 
critical thing I can convey here is that
this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.770> typical<00:00:56.219> laser<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.329> most

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this is not a typical laser that most

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.760 
this is not a typical laser that most
people<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.840> familiar<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> say<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
people are familiar with like say a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
people are familiar with like say a
laser<00:00:59.070> pointer<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.640> laser<00:00:59.969> lightshow<00:01:00.270> where

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
laser pointer or laser lightshow where

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.389 
laser pointer or laser lightshow where
you<00:01:00.989> expect<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> single<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:01.980> beam<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> light

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you expect a single little beam of light

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
you expect a single little beam of light
to<00:01:02.460> continue<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.090> continue<00:01:03.390> continue<00:01:04.080> because

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to continue to continue continue because

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.750 
to continue to continue continue because
people<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:04.860> bring<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> question<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
people will bring up the question of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.570 
people will bring up the question of
well<00:01:06.479> gosh<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> miss<00:01:07.400> well<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
well gosh what if you miss well if you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
well gosh what if you miss well if you
have<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.930> typical<00:01:09.930> laser<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.830> aiming

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
have a typical laser if you're aiming

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
have a typical laser if you're aiming
for<00:01:11.280> an<00:01:11.729> object<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.510> move<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for an object and you move off to the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.149 
for an object and you move off to the
side<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> keep<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:14.010> until

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
side well it's going to keep going until

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
side well it's going to keep going until
it<00:01:14.369> hits<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:14.729> else<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.750> laser<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.110> not

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it hits something else this laser is not

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700 
it hits something else this laser is not
like<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.880> energy<00:01:18.780> profile<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
like that it the energy profile is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
like that it the energy profile is
shaped<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> cone<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
shaped like a cone and I have this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
shaped like a cone and I have this
little<00:01:22.020> rolled-up<00:01:22.530> piece<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.799> paper<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
little rolled-up piece of paper to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
little rolled-up piece of paper to
convey<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.750> energy<00:01:25.110> comes<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
convey that so the energy comes out of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
convey that so the energy comes out of
this<00:01:25.799> aperture<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.360> comes

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this aperture right here and it comes

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630 
this aperture right here and it comes
out<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.170> cone<00:01:28.439> shape<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> laser

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
out in this cone shape now the laser

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
out in this cone shape now the laser
itself<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.450> laser<00:01:30.689> energy<00:01:30.990> itself<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
itself the laser energy itself is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.550 
itself the laser energy itself is
invisible<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.759> order<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> aid<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.869> focus<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
invisible so in order to aid the focus I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
invisible so in order to aid the focus I
have<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> couple<00:01:35.340> focusing<00:01:35.820> beams<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.240> that's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
have a couple focusing beams and that's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.819 
have a couple focusing beams and that's
a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:36.990> frightened<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> might<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a little bit frightened I might get the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.289 
a little bit frightened I might get the
lights<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> moment<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
lights for just a moment I'm going to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.880 
lights for just a moment I'm going to
show<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.659> focusing<00:01:40.110> game<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.439> there's<00:01:40.619> not

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
show you my focusing game so there's not

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
show you my focusing game so there's not
my<00:01:41.130> red<00:01:41.340> beams<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.030> come<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.479> an

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
my red beams and they come in at an

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
my red beams and they come in at an
angle<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> where<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.649> come<00:01:43.920> together<00:01:44.130> at

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
angle and where they come together at

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.530 
angle and where they come together at
the<00:01:45.509> apex<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.380> cone<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:47.610> there

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the apex of that cone right there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
the apex of that cone right there
not<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.490> there

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
not there not there but right there

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
not there not there but right there
that's<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> laser<00:01:52.110> energy<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.860> focused

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that's where the laser energy is focused

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.109 
that's where the laser energy is focused
and<00:01:54.560> that's<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.040> ensure<00:01:56.490> absolute

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and that's how I can ensure absolute

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
and that's how I can ensure absolute
accuracy<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.229> those<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.680> red<00:01:58.890> beams<00:01:59.100> come<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
accuracy so those two red beams come in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.969 
accuracy so those two red beams come in
on<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.270> bottom<00:02:00.659> side<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> tops<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on the bottom side and the tops of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.230 
on the bottom side and the tops of the
bottom<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> top<00:02:02.579> side<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.030> come

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
bottom side and top side of that come

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
bottom side and top side of that come
and<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.869> meet<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.290> apex<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.890> there

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and they meet at that apex right there

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.730 
and they meet at that apex right there
so<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.000> how<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> will<00:02:06.810> focus<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
so that's how I will focus on the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.200 
so that's how I will focus on the
floater<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> when

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
floater and when

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.350 
floater and when
focus<00:02:09.810> directly<00:02:10.230> on<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.800> object<00:02:11.270> object<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
focus directly on that object object of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360 
focus directly on that object object of
regard<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.840> object<00:02:13.170> focus<00:02:13.560> that's<00:02:14.130> when<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
regard and object focus that's when I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.180 
regard and object focus that's when I
could<00:02:14.580> fire<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> laser<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.560> laser<00:02:16.590> does<00:02:16.980> make

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
could fire the laser the laser does make

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.830 
could fire the laser the laser does make
a<00:02:17.220> bit<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.820> clicking<00:02:18.030> snapping<00:02:18.600> sound

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
a bit of a clicking snapping sound

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.410 
a bit of a clicking snapping sound
that's<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.290> electronic<00:02:19.890> shutter<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.430> opens

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that's the electronic shutter that opens

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.880 
that's the electronic shutter that opens
and<00:02:21.540> closes<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.110> allows<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.530> energy

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and closes and it allows the energy

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.030 
and closes and it allows the energy
through<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.970> warmed<00:02:24.240> up<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.570> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
through and I have it warmed up here and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.480 
through and I have it warmed up here and
you<00:02:26.040> should<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.550> able<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> hear<00:02:28.310> that's<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
you should be able to hear that's the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.940 
you should be able to hear that's the
sound<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.090> makes<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.740> laser

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
sound that it makes that is the laser

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
sound that it makes that is the laser
that's<00:02:32.250> not<00:02:32.520> impact<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.210> eye<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.510> course

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that's not impact in the eye of course

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.570 
that's not impact in the eye of course
so<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.230> something<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:35.280> used<00:02:35.460> to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so that's something that it used to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.660 
so that's something that it used to
fairly<00:02:35.880> quickly<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.990> such<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.670> that's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
fairly quickly like such and that's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.640 
fairly quickly like such and that's
that's<00:02:39.180> essentially<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> laser<00:02:40.110> now

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that's essentially it for the laser now

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.380 
that's essentially it for the laser now
one<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.130> challenges<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.090> here

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
one of the challenges that we have here

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.870 
one of the challenges that we have here
is<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:45.000> laser<00:02:45.210> energy<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.610> my<00:02:47.610> light

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
is that the laser energy and my light

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.370 
is that the laser energy and my light
source<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.360> my<00:02:48.570> illumination<00:02:49.170> light

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
source this is my illumination light

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.060 
source this is my illumination light
source<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.420> there's<00:02:52.380> my<00:02:52.530> illumination

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
source on and there's my illumination

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.800 
source on and there's my illumination
light<00:02:53.250> source<00:02:53.520> right<00:02:53.760> there<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
light source right there and this is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.080 
light source right there and this is
very<00:02:55.320> similar<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.070> slit<00:02:56.580> lamps<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.970> we

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
very similar to the slit lamps that we

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.720 
very similar to the slit lamps that we
use<00:02:57.300> during<00:02:57.540> examination<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.830> have<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.280> slit

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
use during examination so I have a slit

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.370 
use during examination so I have a slit
beam<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> light<00:03:00.300> very<00:03:00.630> very<00:03:00.840> narrow<00:03:01.050> beam<00:03:01.290> of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
beam of light very very narrow beam of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.450 
beam of light very very narrow beam of
light<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.890> we're<00:03:02.460> pushing<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.570> through

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
light and we're pushing that but through

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.030 
light and we're pushing that but through
the<00:03:05.460> opening<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> share<00:03:07.050> my<00:03:07.320> light

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the opening and I have to share my light

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.550 
the opening and I have to share my light
source<00:03:08.430> with<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.060> energy<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.200> laser<00:03:10.350> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
source with the energy of the laser and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.860 
source with the energy of the laser and
then<00:03:10.800> both<00:03:11.040> fighting<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.300> through<00:03:12.660> an

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
then both fighting to get through an

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.330 
then both fighting to get through an
aperture<00:03:13.560> opening<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.680> challenge<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
aperture opening and the challenge is is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.460 
aperture opening and the challenge is is
that<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:17.610> my<00:03:17.640> light<00:03:18.570> source<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.050> right<00:03:19.230> down

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
that if my light source is right down

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.380 
that if my light source is right down
the<00:03:19.620> center<00:03:19.830> that's<00:03:20.550> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.940> block<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
the center that's going to block the

the center that's going to block the
laser<00:03:21.540> energy<00:03:22.110> it's<00:03:22.320> going<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.530> come<00:03:22.680> down

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
laser energy it's going to come down

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.140 
laser energy it's going to come down
it's<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> block<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.760> can't<00:03:24.030> do

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
it's going to block it and I can't do

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.460 
it's going to block it and I can't do
that<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.050> light<00:03:25.260> source

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that so I have to have that light source

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.770 
that so I have to have that light source
off<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.130> side<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.640> have<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.630> off

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
off to the side I have to have it to off

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.150 
off to the side I have to have it to off
to<00:03:27.810> one<00:03:28.110> side<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.530> far<00:03:28.710> side<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.100> side

far<00:03:29.580> side<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.000> side<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.420> I'm<00:03:30.840> too<00:03:31.080> far<00:03:31.290> off

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380

to<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.530> side<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:31.920> don't<00:03:32.070> have<00:03:32.190> any<00:03:32.340> light

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.400 
to the side I don't have any light
inside<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.180> eye<00:03:33.210> so<00:03:33.840> there's<00:03:34.050> always<00:03:34.170> this

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
inside the eye so there's always this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.650 
inside the eye so there's always this
battle<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.040> trying<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.850> get<00:03:36.030> enough<00:03:36.390> light<00:03:36.630> in

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
battle of trying to get enough light in

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.510 
battle of trying to get enough light in
there<00:03:36.960> but<00:03:37.140> not<00:03:37.290> block<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> laser<00:03:37.800> energy<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
there but not block the laser energy and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.430 
there but not block the laser energy and
the<00:03:38.970> further<00:03:39.270> back<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.780> working<00:03:40.140> inside

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the further back you're working inside

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.230 
the further back you're working inside
the<00:03:40.500> eye<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.340> more<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.730> those<00:03:41.970> two<00:03:42.210> are

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
the eye the more that those two are

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.360 
the eye the more that those two are
battling<00:03:42.540> each<00:03:42.870> other<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.620> laser<00:03:43.860> really<00:03:44.220> was

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
battling each other the laser really was

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.280 
battling each other the laser really was
designed<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.060> working<00:03:45.420> more<00:03:45.870> towards<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
designed to be working more towards the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
designed to be working more towards the
front<00:03:46.560> part<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.920> eye<00:03:46.950> where<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.670> can

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
front part of the eye where you can

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.280 
front part of the eye where you can
swing<00:03:48.000> your<00:03:48.150> light<00:03:48.300> way<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> side<00:03:49.110> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
swing your light way up to the side and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.480 
swing your light way up to the side and
you<00:03:49.380> have<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.650> worry<00:03:49.800> about<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.250> way<00:03:50.370> up

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
you have to worry about it so the way up

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.130 
you have to worry about it so the way up
to<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.670> other<00:03:50.730> side<00:03:51.030> not<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.450> problem<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.990> not

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
back the to start to battle it out it is

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.810 
back the to start to battle it out it is
one<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.630> big<00:04:00.930> challenges<00:04:01.490> not<00:04:02.490> only<00:04:02.550> to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
one of the big challenges not only to

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.010 
one of the big challenges not only to
see<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> floaters<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.660> then<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.930> get

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
see the floaters but then you get

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.300 
see the floaters but then you get
everything<00:04:04.350> lined<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.040> be<00:04:05.130> able<00:04:05.190> to

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
everything lined up and be able to

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.310 
everything lined up and be able to
deliver<00:04:05.520> an<00:04:05.970> adequate<00:04:06.630> amount<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.990> energy

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
deliver an adequate amount of energy

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.190 
deliver an adequate amount of energy
into<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.310> eye<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.940> where<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> two<00:04:09.930> aren't

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
into that eye and where the two aren't

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440 
into that eye and where the two aren't
battling<00:04:10.560> each<00:04:10.680> other<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.970> that's<00:04:12.180> some<00:04:12.360> of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
battling each other so that's some of

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.300 
battling each other so that's some of
the<00:04:12.480> highlights<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.200> laser<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the highlights of the laser the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.810 
the highlights of the laser the
important<00:04:14.730> take-home<00:04:15.180> points<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.870> that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
important take-home points is that

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.000 
important take-home points is that
it<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.150> an<00:04:17.300> adaptation<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:18.080> existing

the<00:04:28.820> patients<00:04:29.480> are<00:04:29.570> awake<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:30.110> are<00:04:30.200> not

sedated the recovery is rapid there is

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.800 
sedated the recovery is rapid there is
no<00:04:33.860> healing<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.490> takes<00:04:34.550> place<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
no healing that takes place I think the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.750 
no healing that takes place I think the
biggest<00:04:36.020> argument<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.680> have<00:04:36.980> is<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
biggest argument that I have is the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.370 
biggest argument that I have is the
technical<00:04:38.240> difficulty<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.020> procedure

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
technical difficulty of the procedure

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.650 
technical difficulty of the procedure
it's<00:04:39.950> hard<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.000> floaters<00:04:41.330> sometimes

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
it's hard to see the floaters sometimes

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.770 
it's hard to see the floaters sometimes
and<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:42.410> think<00:04:42.520> overall<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:44.270> just<00:04:44.390> a

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
and I think overall it's just a

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.170 
and I think overall it's just a
relatively<00:04:45.320> inefficient<00:04:45.800> process<00:04:46.430> we<00:04:46.850> get<00:04:46.970> so

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
relatively inefficient process we get so

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.970 
relatively inefficient process we get so
use<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.570> magic<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.170> lasers<00:04:48.530> for<00:04:48.680> instance

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
use of the magic of lasers for instance

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.560 
use of the magic of lasers for instance
with<00:04:49.100> LASIK<00:04:49.550> where<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:49.850> get<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.180> procedure

surgical vitrectomy this might be an

surgical vitrectomy this might be an
attractive<00:05:25.460> option<00:05:25.820> for<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.450> so<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.350> thought

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
attractive option for you so I thought

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.680 
attractive option for you so I thought
that<00:05:27.770> going<00:05:28.430> over<00:05:28.640> the<00:05:28.730> laser<00:05:28.910> in<00:05:29.240> person

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
that going over the laser in person

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.240 
that going over the laser in person
might<00:05:30.140> help<00:05:30.320> bring<00:05:30.530> home<00:05:30.650> some<00:05:30.890> points<00:05:31.220> that

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
might help bring home some points that

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.250 
might help bring home some points that
are<00:05:31.580> not<00:05:31.610> really<00:05:32.180> all<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.450> well<00:05:32.780> described

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260

are not really all that well described
on<00:05:33.470> my<00:05:33.890> website<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:34.640> I<00:05:34.700> hope<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:34.880> learn

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
on my website so I hope you learn

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
something look forward to more of these

something look forward to more of these
