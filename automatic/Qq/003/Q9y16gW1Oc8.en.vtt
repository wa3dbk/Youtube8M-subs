00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.839
 no doubts 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.800
 from the four winds 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.600

 Spaniards Mariano Barberán Gijón 5 and his readers have left Havana 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.500
 as heroes after getting the feat of crossing the Atlantic without 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.259
 scales on the broadest part

 the disappearance of four winds 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.060
 it produces great consternation 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.390

 below presented before one of quotas and shut up to the sea because at least we have 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.550
 and then he found himself really

 of the four winds with a mate 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.640
 over the waters of mexico began the legend of four winds and ends a 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.090
 Aerial adventure that had ripped stories before in Spain 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 and the barber and collar companions 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.640

 the pilots have prepared thoroughly to navigate with the help only of the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.830
 stars in a radio audience that has been installed with its loss of 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.150

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.820
 the four winds 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.740
