00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
better than I thought only a few steps

better than I thought only a few steps
are<00:03:36.069> left<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.700> cutting<00:03:37.060> out<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.390> exact

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
are left like cutting out the exact

are left like cutting out the exact
shape<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.380> skis<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:40.020> attaching<00:03:41.020> the

it's<00:04:02.050> actually<00:04:02.440> how<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> always<00:04:02.860> thought<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> ski

it's actually how I always thought a ski

it's actually how I always thought a ski
should<00:04:03.850> be<00:04:04.000> isn't<00:04:04.330> she<00:04:04.480> signs<00:04:04.720> out<00:04:06.390> skiing<00:04:07.390> an

should be isn't she signs out skiing an
experience<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.830> begins<00:04:09.160> well<00:04:09.459> before<00:04:09.490> you

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
experience that begins well before you

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.810
