 and here we are in week 4 of the top 5 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 sniper the truth that many thanks 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.360
 for all the support that this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.220
 series is a pretty difficult series in 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.960
 the channel between quotes because you have 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.399
 that you send the clips and every time 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.529
 I have less left so I hope that 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.290
 send the clips and good I'll leave you the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.210
 week 1 the 2 and 3 in the description and 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.460
 this time we're going for week 4 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 we started with the tournament 5 from the hand of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 our player who browman the first 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 time you participate in being extreme 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.019
 with his free gram we will make a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.359
 head single will continue in the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.179
 map being and is going to make another single 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.769
 continued from a collateral we jump 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.690
 number 4 in the hand of a player already 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.760
 known fatal and this time it's going to be a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 video if you decide how weird is going to do the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 jogging or the typical jogging under the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.300
 shotgun as it happens talking about that ere 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.350
 boom single we go instead of continue 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.460
 I just was a player that I've already 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 seen the clip is against the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.690
 Comet another put the re charge 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.220
 He came back and classified it here 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.030
 because the truth is the first trick that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.980
 they send me and it's a very good click 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 we passed with the number 3 of the hand of a 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.760
 well- known player piqueras has been 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 in the tournament who knows if he's going to win and 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.170
 well we are in the rate in the typical 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 spot single double triple 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 well- known player rm axis serious other 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.550

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 Single triple triple and four hurdles 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.160

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.550
 that we continue like this but I ask you please 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.810
 send me more clips because I already 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.550
 there are very few I will have two or 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 three so I will not be able to continue with this 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.060
 series if you send me more clips and it's very 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.860
 simple you only have to do four 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.320
 corridors to be able to participate and be 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.510
 promoted indirectly is very very 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.610
 simple you have to upload the video and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 put it in the cult on youtube or send 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.000
 a private message to youtube or via 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.440

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.380
 send is very simple and the quality 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.880
 with which you can appreciate the clip to me 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 I'm worth it because I put a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.450
 poquillo of effects and such and then it 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.650
 you will see more or less well and much here 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.590
 send more clicks I ask you please 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.210
 because there are very few left 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.500

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.180
