and we can do a grid overlay with with

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.820 
and we can do a grid overlay with with
another<00:02:11.209> system<00:02:11.599> but<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.230> lose<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
another system but then we lose the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.949 
another system but then we lose the
video<00:02:13.700> effects<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.239> everything<00:02:14.300> else<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.900> if

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
video effects and everything else so if

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.100 
video effects and everything else so if
we<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.260> take<00:02:15.470> our<00:02:16.099> flexi<00:02:16.519> backer<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.150> put<00:02:18.080> a

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
we just take our flexi backer and put a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.229 
we just take our flexi backer and put a
grid<00:02:18.319> on<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.519> grid<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> white

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
grid on it or if you have a grid a white

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.910 
grid on it or if you have a grid a white
when<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.629> do<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.930> again<00:02:21.170> make<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> something

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
when I do that again make to something

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.680 
when I do that again make to something
like<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:22.670> yeah<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:24.920> pretty<00:02:25.190> close

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.000 

that<00:02:29.690> actually<00:02:29.959> that's<00:02:30.019> perfect

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that actually that's perfect

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.619 
that actually that's perfect
if<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.519> one<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.030> these<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.299> doesn't<00:02:32.540> have

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
if we get one of these that doesn't have

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:44.009 
if we get one of these that doesn't have
