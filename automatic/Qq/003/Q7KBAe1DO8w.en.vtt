rotation<00:00:23.939> sort<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> players<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> draft

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
rotation sort of players I in the draft

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
rotation sort of players I in the draft
and<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.490> that's<00:00:26.609> Eileen<00:00:27.390> young<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and and and that's Eileen young for that

and and and that's Eileen young for that
reason<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:30.179> he's<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> ideal<00:00:31.219> score

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
reason I I think he's the ideal score

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.799 
reason I I think he's the ideal score
that<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> bring<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.000> bench<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.660> can

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that you bring off the bench that can

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.479 
that you bring off the bench that can
play<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:35.250> play<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
play a little bit of one can play a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
play a little bit of one can play a
little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.750> light<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> up

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
little bit of two can really light it up

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
little bit of two can really light it up
he<00:00:37.230> reminds<00:00:37.590> me<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> bit<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> young<00:00:38.370> Lou

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
he reminds me a bit of a young Lou

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
he reminds me a bit of a young Lou
Williams<00:00:38.989> except<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.200> he's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> better

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
Williams except I think he's a better

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
Williams except I think he's a better
shooter<00:00:40.680> than<00:00:40.829> Lou<00:00:41.129> Williams<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.910> even<00:00:42.239> even

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
shooter than Lou Williams is even even

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
shooter than Lou Williams is even even
right<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.770> only<00:00:43.829> did<00:00:44.040> he<00:00:44.070> shoot<00:00:44.340> well

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
right now it not only did he shoot well

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.940 
right now it not only did he shoot well
from<00:00:44.640> three-point<00:00:45.480> percentage<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.649> he's<00:00:46.829> an

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
from three-point percentage but he's an

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.500 
from three-point percentage but he's an
elite<00:00:47.219> free-throw<00:00:47.730> shooter<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> best

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
elite free-throw shooter one of the best

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.610 
elite free-throw shooter one of the best
free-throw<00:00:48.690> shooters<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> draft

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
free-throw shooters in the draft

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
free-throw shooters in the draft
actually<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> while<00:00:50.789> he's<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> super

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
actually and while he's not a super

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
actually and while he's not a super
explosive<00:00:52.620> athlete<00:00:52.890> he's<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.250> quick<00:00:53.579> he's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
explosive athlete he's very quick he's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
explosive athlete he's very quick he's
very<00:00:54.000> crafty<00:00:54.510> getting<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> basket<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
very crafty getting to the basket and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
very crafty getting to the basket and
again<00:00:56.190> I'm<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.699> sure<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.969> ever<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.360> him

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
again I'm not sure I ever see him

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479 
again I'm not sure I ever see him
starting<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> NBA<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.250> could

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
starting in the NBA but I could

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
starting in the NBA but I could
definitely<00:00:59.670> see<00:01:00.239> him<00:01:00.420> being<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.050> guy<00:01:01.710> that's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
definitely see him being a guy that's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
definitely see him being a guy that's
going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> six-man<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> maybe<00:01:03.690> even<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to be a six-man and maybe even a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to be a six-man and maybe even a
six-man<00:01:04.350> candidate<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> year<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
six-man candidate of the year down the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
six-man candidate of the year down the
road<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> team<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> utilize

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
road for a team they know how to utilize

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
road for a team they know how to utilize
his<00:01:08.220> strengths<00:01:08.640> yeah<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.170> area

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
his strengths yeah I think the one area

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130 
his strengths yeah I think the one area
where<00:01:11.040> young<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:12.090> gotten<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.479> advantage<00:01:12.990> over

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
where young has gotten an advantage over

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.120 
where young has gotten an advantage over
Hanlon<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.400> Boston<00:01:14.760> College<00:01:15.090> point<00:01:15.360> guard<00:01:15.540> is

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
Hanlon the Boston College point guard is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
Hanlon the Boston College point guard is
his<00:01:17.210> athleticism<00:01:18.210> he's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> he's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> quicker

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
his athleticism he's a he's a quicker

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
his athleticism he's a he's a quicker
more<00:01:20.400> dynamic<00:01:21.060> athlete<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.020> doesn't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
more dynamic athlete now that doesn't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.469 
more dynamic athlete now that doesn't
mean<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.860> he's<00:01:23.220> he's<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.970> jet<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> all

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
mean you know he's he's the jet of all

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
mean you know he's he's the jet of all
jets<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.080> he's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> better<00:01:25.439> athlete<00:01:25.700> Hanlon's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
jets but he's a better athlete Hanlon's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.749 
jets but he's a better athlete Hanlon's
bigger<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.450> he<00:01:27.570> fits<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> size<00:01:28.560> profile<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bigger so he fits the size profile a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.520 
bigger so he fits the size profile a
little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.390> better<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.930> than<00:01:31.229> young

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
little bit better I think than young

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.679 
little bit better I think than young
does<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> handling<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.030> crafty<00:01:33.570> with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
does and handling is very crafty with

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.679 
does and handling is very crafty with
the<00:01:33.750> ball<00:01:33.890> he's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.280> shooter<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.570> his

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the ball he's a good shooter can get his

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
the ball he's a good shooter can get his
shot<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:36.930> against<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> variety<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.130> different

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
defenders he's seen just about every

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.090 
defenders he's seen just about every
defense<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.470> he<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> only

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
defense because he was really the only

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.310 
defense because he was really the only
guy<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.820> Boston<00:01:42.360> College<00:01:42.600> way<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> had<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
guy that Boston College way you had to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
guy that Boston College way you had to
stop<00:01:43.500> him<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.070> saw<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> variety<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
stop him so he saw a variety of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
stop him so he saw a variety of
different<00:01:45.090> defenses<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> last<00:01:46.280> last

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
different defenses over the last last

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
different defenses over the last last
two<00:01:47.460> years<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> his<00:01:48.090> college<00:01:48.479> career<00:01:48.659> at<00:01:48.840> BC

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
two years of his college career at BC

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
two years of his college career at BC
and<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> liken<00:01:50.880> him<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and I kind of liken him to more of a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.380 
and I kind of liken him to more of a
greivis<00:01:52.079> vasquez<00:01:52.560> type<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.159> player<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
greivis vasquez type of player and I

greivis vasquez type of player and I
think<00:01:54.600> he's<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.110> well<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> NBA

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

think he's going to do well in the NBA

in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> league<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:09.149> they're<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
in the league I think they're going to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
in the league I think they're going to
be<00:02:09.539> they're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.080> very

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
be they're going to be very

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.770 
be they're going to be very
values<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.430> him<00:02:11.580> more<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.030> his<00:02:12.420> fringe

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
values but I see him more as his fringe

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930 
values but I see him more as his fringe
first-rounders<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.340> first<00:02:14.550> part<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
first-rounders in the first part of the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.780 
first-rounders in the first part of the
second<00:02:15.270> round<00:02:15.650> yeah<00:02:16.650> look<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.070> agree<00:02:17.190> Jay<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
second round yeah look I agree Jay and I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.220 
second round yeah look I agree Jay and I
think<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> headlands<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.570> nice<00:02:18.720> call<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> think

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
think the headlands a nice call I think

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.510 
think the headlands a nice call I think
he's<00:02:19.590> been<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> more<00:02:20.370> underrated

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
he's been one of the more underrated

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.020 
he's been one of the more underrated
players<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> draft<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.730> part

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
players in the in the draft in part

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.250 
players in the in the draft in part
because<00:02:24.180> he<00:02:24.390> played<00:02:24.570> on<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.690> bad<00:02:24.900> team<00:02:25.080> at

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
because he played on a bad team at

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
because he played on a bad team at
Boston<00:02:25.590> College<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.210> was

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
Boston College and I think that it was

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
Boston College and I think that it was
somewhat<00:02:27.780> ignored<00:02:28.110> because<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.220> think

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
somewhat ignored because of that I think

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.940 
somewhat ignored because of that I think
the<00:02:30.150> interesting<00:02:30.360> thing<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the interesting thing is here is is that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.320 
the interesting thing is here is is that
you've<00:02:32.100> got<00:02:32.130> those<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:32.580> elite<00:02:32.760> point<00:02:32.970> guards

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you've got those two elite point guards

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.910 
you've got those two elite point guards
you<00:02:33.420> got<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> couple<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.960> other<00:02:34.110> ones<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.770> didn't

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you got a couple of other ones we didn't

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.170 
you got a couple of other ones we didn't
talk<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.370> lawn<00:02:35.520> right<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:36.090> we

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
talk about the lawn right I think we

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270 
talk about the lawn right I think we
kind<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> agree<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.930> where<00:02:37.680> he's<00:02:37.860> slotted<00:02:38.100> we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
kind of agree on where he's slotted we

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560 
kind of agree on where he's slotted we
didn't<00:02:38.430> talk<00:02:38.490> about<00:02:38.640> Terry<00:02:38.880> Rozier<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.330> think

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
didn't talk about Terry Rozier I think

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.480 
didn't talk about Terry Rozier I think
we<00:02:39.630> kind<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.840> agree<00:02:40.110> where<00:02:40.290> he<00:02:40.410> slotted<00:02:40.710> III

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
we kind of agree where he slotted III

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.440 
we kind of agree where he slotted III
didn't<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.060> gonna<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.330> great

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
didn't think there's gonna be a great

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.510 
didn't think there's gonna be a great
point<00:02:42.660> guard<00:02:42.900> draft<00:02:43.200> coming<00:02:43.950> into<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> draft

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
point guard draft coming into the draft

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.800 
point guard draft coming into the draft
but<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.760> actually<00:02:44.880> think<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.360> there's<00:02:45.570> five

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
but I actually think now there's five

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.230 
but I actually think now there's five
six<00:02:46.200> guys<00:02:47.130> who<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.520> really<00:02:47.850> think<00:02:47.970> could<00:02:48.150> make

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
six guys who I really think could make

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.270 
six guys who I really think could make
an<00:02:48.360> impact<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.840> league<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.110> some<00:02:49.980> way<00:02:50.130> or

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
an impact in the league in some way or

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.100 
an impact in the league in some way or
the<00:02:50.370> other<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.270> draft<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.840> think

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the other I in this draft and I think

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.510 
the other I in this draft and I think
it's<00:02:52.230> part<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:52.770> makes<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.250> depth<00:02:53.430> of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
it's part of what makes the depth of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520 
it's part of what makes the depth of
this<00:02:53.610> draft<00:02:54.080> especially<00:02:55.080> with<00:02:55.200> Golden<00:02:55.500> State

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
this draft especially with Golden State

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.110 
this draft especially with Golden State
winning<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> championship<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.790> everybody

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
winning the championship and everybody

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760 
winning the championship and everybody
talking<00:02:57.209> about<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> game<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.740> a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
talking about the game going in a
