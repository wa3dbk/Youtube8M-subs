on the right here is the one you want to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
on the right here is the one you want to
be<00:01:28.289> using<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.420> logic<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> sba<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
be using with the logic and sba is a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.899 
be using with the logic and sba is a
full<00:01:33.210> 4-pole<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.020> 4-pole<00:01:34.440> stereo<00:01:34.950> audio<00:01:35.220> cable

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.950 

so<00:01:40.909> that's<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.210> one<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.390> want<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.570> be<00:01:41.689> using

so that's the one you want to be using

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.020 
so that's the one you want to be using
the<00:01:42.170> current<00:01:42.500> Auto<00:01:42.649> comms<00:01:43.039> if<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
the current Auto comms if you have a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.300 
the current Auto comms if you have a
older<00:01:44.780> war<00:01:44.960> TOCOM<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.590> want<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.829> be<00:01:45.920> using<00:01:46.189> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
older war TOCOM you want to be using the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.010 
older war TOCOM you want to be using the
other<00:01:46.490> audio<00:01:46.850> cable<00:01:47.299> here<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:47.689> one<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
other audio cable here this one on the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
other audio cable here this one on the
left<00:01:48.259> this<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.189> different<00:01:49.549> because<00:01:49.789> it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
left this one is different because it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
left this one is different because it
has<00:01:50.299> on<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.200> hub<00:01:51.560> connector<00:01:52.340> which<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.729> the

pin that has the black casing around it

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.590 
pin that has the black casing around it
is<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.780> free<00:01:57.170> pole<00:01:57.439> pen

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.780 

to<00:02:01.750> four-pole<00:02:02.260> now<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.070> significant

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to four-pole now this is significant

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.609 
to four-pole now this is significant
because<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.180> older<00:02:04.450> water<00:02:04.600> comes<00:02:04.990> were<00:02:05.229> free

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
because the older water comes were free

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.469 
because the older water comes were free
poles<00:02:05.920> within<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.340> auxiliaries<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:07.240> gives

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
poles within the auxiliaries this gives
