00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 for me 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.570
 to 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.599
 ah 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.459
 today we are going to make sirloin in sauce 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.570
 pate of the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:23.500
 need are white wine black pepper 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.240
 oil salt onion pate cream and the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 sirloin extra tender dessert 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.460
 The first thing we are going to do is in a 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.910
 frying pan oil onion very 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.010
 chopped and salt we're going to have about 67 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.640
 minutes until the onion snares and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 put soft 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.469
 once the onion is tender 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.469
 let's throw the cream 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.050
 let's move it well 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 so that it integrates 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.370
 and now we are going to take a little 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 all 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.520
 and now let's take 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 the foie gras kitten 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 and we're going to move everything until the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.400
 ingredients are integrated 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.290
 once the paper has melted 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.920
 let's take a splash 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.920
 of white wine 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.350
 we are going to move everything 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.180
 and when the steam wine is going to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 turn off the candle 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.670
 so let's proceed to cut our 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.890
 tender extra sirloin from the well as 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.189
 you see in the video it's pretty easy to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.369
 cut very tender has very very little 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.369
 fat and you will see the rich who are 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.430
 in a pan we put a little bit of 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.080
 oil to heat and now let's take 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.080
 the sun tickers and videos 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 we have our sirloin made 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.750
 true that it is a sirloin that is made 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.120
 very fast 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.790
 now let's catch and we're going to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.790
 accompany our paper sauce 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.630
 well we have our sirloin made 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.030
 we have accompanied it with some potatoes 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 bakeries and some asparagus as you can see 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.230
 it is necessary to cut off pressure 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.950
 cut because the sirloin is very 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.960
 tender and above all it is very very juicy 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.580
 so you do not need the flesh 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.580
 put in the previous pan with the sauce
