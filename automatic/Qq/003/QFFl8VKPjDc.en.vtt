00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.400
 days you leave early in the morning and only 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.290
 around the end of the day is the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 vegetables or failure alone and that has in 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.279
 refrigerator can be at least cars and 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.300
 turns a complete meal 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.099
 Do you want to see what I do in a flash? 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:28.369

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.800
 of four large eggs debated two 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.110
 cups of various vegetables and veggies is 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.769
 that I'm using purple onion team in 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.120
 Africa Tomato and Pod Temperinhos na 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.370
 today's recipe will have thyme 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.739
 basil and a tablespoon of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.360
 olive oil to use to lose this recipe 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.640
 yields two servings 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.559
 I'll show you both ways. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.930
 prepare the first one here in the 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.909
 wood and the other then the show will be 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.750
 done in the oven and if you do not have much 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:00.280
 dexterity in belletti faced and also 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.089
 the sides can pick up a brush 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.659
 I'll start by braising our 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.880
 vegetables 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.520
 if you have any protein whatsoever 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.650
 beef and sautÃ© the first vegetables 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.630
 after the car it does not dry out 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.510
 an interesting tip if you will use 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.850
 tomato but only in the pan does not in 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.530
 Oven not that in the oven and will take water not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.760
 will be so cute will leave our 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 people are cuddly of wood that my 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.490
 niece was prescribed but if you have 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:42.380
 That leftover brat broccoli he already 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:47.620
 has taken over is to have a ring and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.620
 covered they will weigh over the net 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 building heat is faster 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 if you have already returned only the same joins 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.670
 flavors 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.630
 I will distribute the Brazilian food and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.580
 put our objective on the league having 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.220
 My mother to do the mec mec 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.810
 from the very large family 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.430
 another you have four or two tests 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.700
 new buildings can put a little bit of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 water focused milk debtors 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 the measurement is for each new half shell 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.750
 this book that will add a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.750
 planting half of our young people 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.830
 the other tip always pulling the sardine 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.090
 do not get stuck in the middle people 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:47.310
 if you want to speed up the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 process only anppa I cook a little 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.050
 to come out while the part of 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.320
 low ball the ball that was ahead was 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.320
 quickly 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.600
 It's all right and now if I was just as 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.780
 used would turn out to be a boss but I would not 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:16.820
 I'm a chef truck 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.820
 you can actually do so 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.880
 now I have some to end not 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.140
 burn and give a smell 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.760
 a taste a little shine in a way 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.800
 also that you can offer some 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720
 vegetables and vegetables your child does not 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.000
 accepts very well although it is not the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.890
 favor is to disguise the taste of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.340
 food in other preparations 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.350
 sometimes we need it then promises 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.430
 caprichar and offer a good amount 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 to watch 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.170
 in fact he has not got runs now 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.340
 ready and I'll teach you how to do 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.840
 the same and led 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.970
 Only in the oven, the woman. 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 to make omelette in the oven I'll start 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.810
 preparing an ivory shape but you 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.060
 can also use this year and 15 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.960
 little ones that we have without problem 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.730
 some 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.650
 I spent some olive oil and now I go 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.380
 distribute the vegetables and if you have 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.500
 Finally meat cheese here I'll use the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.709
 that I had already shown to you 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.270
 spinach and how did I tell you? 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.230
 any niece was slow in the pod 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:31.670
 and now before putting the interests 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:36.430
 of the board what to worry about arriving 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.430
 until your mouth because if I go, it will grow 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.190
 in full the kitchen grated fresh 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.770
 another tip I give is that if you 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.620
 put cheese now puts it on top goes 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.030
 gratin that beautiful golden color 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.030
 from here I'll take it outside 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.360
 now I have taught you several ways to 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.130
 presenting the same athletic is on the hour 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.080
 put your hand in the dough and in your house 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.650
 If you want to show us what you want? 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.140
 did 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.640
 just use the hashtag to stop at home 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.660
 in social media 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.770
 now success a kiss is the phrase that 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.680
 You see my mother loved it. 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.740
 that cook's cooking program 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.420

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.280

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.280
 possible to have a letter of that done 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.640
 It's cute he'll hammer you in the snow and 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.460

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.670

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.200
