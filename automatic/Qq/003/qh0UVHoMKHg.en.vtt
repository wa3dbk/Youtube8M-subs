00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that's how I've been doing it lately and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.740 
that's how I've been doing it lately and
I<00:01:40.799> usually<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.700> six<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.150> seven<00:01:42.420> weeks

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

I usually go six or seven weeks
that's<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.500> usual<00:01:43.710> time<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that's just my usual time but like I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.210 
that's just my usual time but like I
said<00:01:44.850> I've<00:01:44.909> been<00:01:45.030> doing<00:01:45.270> 10<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> 11<00:01:45.810> weeks<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
this I think that's why I'm having some
some<00:01:49.110> issues<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
some issues up here it's because you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
some issues up here it's because you
know<00:01:52.939> they<00:01:53.939> may<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:55.070> they're<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.280> under

their<00:01:56.670> own<00:01:56.790> weight

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
their own weight

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.270 
their own weight
you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:59.130> new<00:01:59.369> growth<00:01:59.640> comes<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the room is stronger peer so when they

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.150 
the room is stronger peer so when they
snap<00:02:45.620> off<00:02:45.890> they'll<00:02:46.550> grow<00:02:46.790> back<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.950> big

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
bill but at the same time when I guess

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.150 
bill but at the same time when I guess
when<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.500> go

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160

happen again

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.680 
happen again
going<00:02:57.830> every<00:02:57.980> six<00:02:58.190> seven<00:02:58.490> weeks<00:02:58.640> condition<00:02:59.570> my

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
going every six seven weeks condition my

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.950 
going every six seven weeks condition my
hair<00:02:59.840> now<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.320> wasn't<00:03:00.800> before<00:03:00.920> because<00:03:01.780> my<00:03:02.780> hair

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
hair now I wasn't before because my hair

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.430 
hair now I wasn't before because my hair
it's<00:03:03.050> not<00:03:03.200> like<00:03:03.380> I'm<00:03:03.680> still<00:03:03.860> not<00:03:04.100> like<00:03:04.280> but<00:03:05.440> I

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it's not like I'm still not like but I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.350 
it's not like I'm still not like but I
wouldn't<00:03:07.400> had<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.580> condition<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:08.030> many<00:03:08.180> ways

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
wouldn't had a condition of many ways

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.010 
wouldn't had a condition of many ways
because<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.910> my<00:03:10.910> hair<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.210> super<00:03:11.420> dry<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
think that probably contributed to my

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.470 
think that probably contributed to my
some<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.870> my<00:03:14.930> last<00:03:15.140> minute<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.940> mean
