00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.438
Okay, I'm Bengi.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.772
If you need any
other sizes,

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:07.174
you please let me
know, all right ?

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:08.242
Okay.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.510
There you go.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.245
Thank you.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.113
What's your name ?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.314
Taffeta.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.217
Okay.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.955
Oh, this is a yes.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.956
Yes.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.992
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.293
Hi, how are you ?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.661
Did someone help
you today ?

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:28.762
Yeah, um...

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.700
Hmm.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.668
Who was it ?

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.370
You know, I
don't--I don't see him.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.305
Do you know what
he looks like ?

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:43.744
Yeah, he is wearing
like a-- like a vest,

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.913
or like a plaid shirt,
I feel like--

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.248
I don't know what everyone
who works here wore today.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:52.419
Um, he had short hair,
so that'll probably do it.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.520
Just that.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.157
He's...

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.496
Black eye--black eyes ?

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.697
He has black eyes ?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.232
Yeah, he had black eyes.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.867
So he has black pupils ?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.070
Yeah.
Are there any other
distinguishing features ?

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.406
I would guess he probably
voted for Obama.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.373
I know I did.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:14.508
What ?

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.376
Oh my God, that's him,
that's definitely him.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.377
He doesn't work here.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.378
Okay.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.479
You know what
I just remembered ?

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:20.514
Nobody helped me.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.615
So forget it.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.217
Okay, we work on commission
here, so if someone

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.985
did help you,
you should probably tell me.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.553
Can I just, like,
give you,

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.456
like $10 and you
just leave me alone ?

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:33.694
Darren, Bengi, Debri,
Kaching, get in here, please.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.995
Kaching ?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.102
Thank you.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.937
That's him.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.540
You really can't
tell us apart ?

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.743
Whatever, Taffeta.

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.912
Your name says Amy
on your card.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.113
Yeah.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.116
It would, I was
in the witness--

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.384
I witnessed, uh...

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.719
You were in the
witness ?

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.087
Protection program ?
Protection--

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.588
Program.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:02.756
And you just told
me that ?

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:07.694
Hey.
Hi.

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:08.695
Did someone help
you today ?

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.264
Yeah, the Asian
over there.
