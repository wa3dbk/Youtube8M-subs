which reporter because it had shipped
pora<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> had<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> lot<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.509> defense<00:01:48.869> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
pora because I had a lot of defense but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.959 
pora because I had a lot of defense but
whatever<00:01:49.880> he<00:01:50.880> uses<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> psychic<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> does<00:01:52.469> it

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
whatever he uses a psychic and does it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.359 
whatever he uses a psychic and does it
like<00:01:53.969> half<00:01:54.840> damage<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.619> poo<00:01:55.799> pourri<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
like half damage to my poo pourri on and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.899 
like half damage to my poo pourri on and
I<00:01:57.060> ice<00:01:57.299> beam<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> dies<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.640> sends

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
I ice beam it again and it dies he sends

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
I ice beam it again and it dies he sends
out<00:02:00.030> his<00:02:00.060> electivire<00:02:00.749> and<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.320> thinking

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
out his electivire and I was thinking

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
out his electivire and I was thinking
maybe<00:02:01.979> I'd<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.490> faster<00:02:02.850> than<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> stayed

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
maybe I'd be faster than it so I stayed

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.639 
maybe I'd be faster than it so I stayed
in<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> used<00:02:04.530> boiling<00:02:05.009> water<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.990> burn<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
in and used boiling water to burn it but

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.960 
in and used boiling water to burn it but
it<00:02:07.829> turns<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> special

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it turns out one to be a special

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.509 
it turns out one to be a special
electivire<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.950> faster<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.310> me

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
electivire and two to be faster than me

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.420 
electivire and two to be faster than me
so<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.239> takes<00:02:12.390> out<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.810> vaporeon<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.950> send<00:02:14.340> out

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so it takes out my vaporeon I send out

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.240 
so it takes out my vaporeon I send out
my<00:02:14.459> Kabuto

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
my Kabuto

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.550 
my Kabuto
and<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> banded<00:02:17.050> waterfall<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.920> um<00:02:19.560> it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
and use a banded waterfall on it um it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
and use a banded waterfall on it um it
goes<00:02:20.770> down<00:02:20.980> he<00:02:21.460> sends<00:02:21.760> out<00:02:21.880> his<00:02:21.910> dragon<00:02:22.690> type

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
goes down he sends out his dragon type

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.810 
goes down he sends out his dragon type
he<00:02:23.260> doesn't<00:02:23.530> he's<00:02:23.620> not<00:02:23.680> sure<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.280> I'm<00:02:24.430> banded

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
he doesn't he's not sure if I'm banded

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.580 
he doesn't he's not sure if I'm banded
or<00:02:24.910> not<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.330> he<00:02:25.540> still<00:02:25.720> sends<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> dragon

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
or not but he still sends out the dragon

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.070 
or not but he still sends out the dragon
type<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.970> switched<00:02:28.210> into<00:02:28.390> my<00:02:28.570> ludicolo

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
type so I switched into my ludicolo

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.920 
type so I switched into my ludicolo
because<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.770> has<00:02:29.890> ice<00:02:30.070> cream<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.810> he<00:02:31.810> uses

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
because it has ice cream and he uses

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.710 
because it has ice cream and he uses
dragon<00:02:32.440> tail<00:02:32.910> which<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.030> kind<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.270> sad<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.570> my

leftovers<00:03:20.739> HP<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:22.330> go<00:03:22.600> into<00:03:22.750> Kabutops<00:03:23.410> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
leftovers HP and I go into Kabutops and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.320 
leftovers HP and I go into Kabutops and
use<00:03:23.709> Stone<00:03:23.950> Edge<00:03:23.980> hoping<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.940> won't<00:03:25.120> miss
