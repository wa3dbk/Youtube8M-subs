00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.429
 Brussels 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.440
 at costa brava not that turn on themselves but we can not wait 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.749
 nicolas l the snow 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.429
 the beating couple 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.269
 sew exceeds killer 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.220
 haha after paris winter 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.810
 because nicolas in celebration 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 if the combat sports quite traumatic for the cd 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.670
 now 6 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.010
 it's traumatic for me too 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.570
 you have to know that parent is about 135000 ski accident 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.800
 so actually 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.830
 there are a lot of accidents that includes the can be enough of 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.880
 prevent a future polizzi help 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.440
 of this preparation leaves itself in the in the ski and several parameters that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 actually come into play 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.540
 the factor for the physical that is 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.290
 1 muscle preparation but also a factor that is related to vigilance 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.490
 that is to say, put oneself in conditions 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.720
 acceptable for them to ski and that it works working in 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.040
 uphill 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.570
 and for 100 m a lot of people go skiing are would have prepared and that's 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.780
 a request as we understand a lot of words from our patients who 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 come in cabinet know how they can prepare for skiing what is the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.680
 way to do it then the big themes of what the mine demonstrate 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.660
 so we will talk 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.810
 with the years thirty scramble they are produced 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 the big themes have made this preparation what is done% 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.299
 first October and warm-up which is essential to the practice of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 any sport then if there is any work super muscled the air 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.380
 group by group 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.750
 that is to say that we will work for example the thighs 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 the posterior muscles the inner muscles of the seizures but also quite a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 work called owner who federates vigilance 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.300
 at the level of 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 at the ankles at the knees 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.370
 a lot of knee trauma so you have to strengthen the 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.260
 muscles that are around you have to try 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.700
 to improve revenue this vigilance 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 and then finally a last phase that is good a fuel phase we know 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.950
 than 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.939
 this important is irresponsible especially after the sport advised me 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.870
 came 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.900
 this coming the almost mandatory and people are doing 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.650
 more or less well so we tried to compile through ten minutes 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.149
 exercise 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:16.499
 the situation involves conveyor to take during a session of 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:16.969
 Step 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.989
 So here is the group's tough guy a year ago 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:26.079
 the lowest level total sport since the national 7 alas who 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:26.529
 will we 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:30.329
 but then showed them when one is preparing 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.280
 how am I preparing 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.600
 and in fact already the exercises demonstrate and at the same time it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.189
 you must do with me 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.669
 in the first session 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.299
 he missed a session 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.159
 who's talking about kwanhama level zero up 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.849
 of yours 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.999
 wifi with crescendo 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.349
 hard 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.249
 does it if the most difficult 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.739
 do you advise in level so much you have to start when he 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.000
 must 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 you start a month before leaving as orange reports that to the pope the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.799
 three weeks three weeks before skiing or even weeks before 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.519
 and these are easy exercises 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.519
 it is already necessary 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.659
 after the facts 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.059
 will be the exercise outfit 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.019
 their contract and endurance facing him a little harder 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.559
 but initially the exercise is easy 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.599
 and at each session begins with a warm up as nicolas say 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.789
 warming up muscle building 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.449
 tactical work 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 it's a balanced job 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.929
 the propeller section and then after a stretch that just show us 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.749
 before small exercises 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.729
 like that where current valuations 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.730
 in some time worked the back muscles and in writing scares 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.029
 duprat 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.519
 at the break the salesmen of the pulpit 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.909
 having bowed 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.139
 and goes back 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.459
 that's where you work triceps and muscles 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.509
 from the top of the back 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.239
 in a world unlike to enjoy more yes I could rest 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.319
 on the tracks and then avoid accidents 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.419
 here since bamako this club is very careful about your health every 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.929
 two you are shy but also 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.939
 you decline sports enthusiast we certainly have other banks whose 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.199
 you will frame us in a way both the medical trulli and 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.480
 musically do everything 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.180
 sports and medical 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.700
 give an assurance even the nerve no contraindication to practice 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.819
 exercises 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.699
 we made it accessible to all 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.580
 even though there are actually levels 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.830
 it's progressive 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680
 and about three levels 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.039
 so, but do not hesitate either to resume cantal I 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.309
 think of me seems a little harder 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.709
 actually as the saying goes the more difficulty in intensity 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:46.959
 since it's 10 minutes in the party a sequence lasts 10 minutes so it's 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.659
 more in the intensity in realizing exercises 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.879
 but 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.659
 none of the more dangerous exercises 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.919
 it's normally and the break 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.320
 to protect all the joints and prepare at best we will do 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.110
 trust to the Asian shore yes 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.889
 now that he is here 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.680
 with the residents could go and on the advice of nicolas m 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.289
 we will also prepare you right now 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.949
 when I can 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.210
 and all schuss 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.449
