00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.360
 m devotee and today here we have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.609
 add 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 oddly enough I add on 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.180
 what it is so to say well, in short it is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.130
 shader guys and how do you say that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.270
 pack shaders and there is not one not two not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 three very very collected videos here 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.930
 from different collections just throw 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.559
 Here I basically turned out 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 shaders settings and here they are not all 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.469
 let's go let's say we choose which 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 shaders ultra of course ultra from me 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.350
 comp we walk all pulls see everything 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:02.219
 principle goes fps 30th is quite normal 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.789
 so here it is quiet very very very 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 lot 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.220
 and here I am even the weakest 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.260
 companies have to go because here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.420
 there is such a very weak Schilder 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.530
 for example these 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 because without shadows, along with the shadow, even such 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.939
 Of course weak shaders year now I 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.430
 I'll get it even weaker here they are in principle 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.840
 the very first you see well actually 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 end shaders worse 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.790
 the graphics are worse than usual but still who 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.460
 missing these shaders so he 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.520
 choose there let's say some 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.579
 such 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.710
 so beautiful well shorter guys the link will be 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.630
 In the description of the application Zalyu on Yandex here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.530
 download 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.329
 my shaders so let's say here and write in 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.060
 comments they liked you were not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.060
 here comes a bunch here I leaf through 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.330
 what else's a little worse with 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.790
 shadows new sun would 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.740
 normal well then dear friends to all
