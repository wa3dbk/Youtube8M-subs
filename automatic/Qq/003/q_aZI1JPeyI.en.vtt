00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.010
 he has none 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.989
 I want to put a year 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.260
 our big game 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.779
 where will you be 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.799
 promises we have here as we have already 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.990
 ef 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.259
 educated 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.429
 the panel is fully compatible with brightness 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.640
 the original 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 so fit perfectly 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 there is a panel break 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830
 how do you observe 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.150
 for those who do not know the original sound of southern Italy pass here 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790
 it's a sound to give up 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 ah 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 this central has connectivity cap 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.690
 access to small drive 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.680
 as well as touchscreen 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.200
 like any other central 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.110
 besides central it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.510
 with delegate 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.510
 We can see it here now. 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.720
 she will come 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.190
 enter with 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.909
 consumption as of the surplus logo 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.710
 the inter also makes it very simple the denmark wants to remember knowledge 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.260
 duo 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.030
 the operator 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.380
 the icons are quite is 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 has direct 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.470
 I chose the sweet choices and simply with a modern twist 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.590
 on earth you change people we change that tells us that some options like 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.970
 the entrance case for him 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.160
 there can digital TV already built-in 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.910
 bird company 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 files that can be scanned card 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.440
 I'm from osb and then all kind of file even local that could 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 storage 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.410
 with this signature is that the games that complete interesting turn 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.750
 the people but if you can think I'm the other options 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.740
 here you enter options 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.259
 but you can 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.490
 Access 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.979
 the time regulation at the time the date 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.399
 is regular and of the organ itself 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.260
 in education of regulations 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.459
 both on the front side the left-hand side 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 anterior posterior 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.419
 is that in this new system 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.939
 people who do not like the 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.399
 next ipes 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.049
 in the original you can even adapt 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.959
 the types of 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.949
 the ocde 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.689
 and opted for actions 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.599
 doha and goal 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.379
 8 point 3 8 point 3 which may be 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.319
 he likes some forums and you may notice that the path is not 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.959
 where 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.819
 is found 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.529
 the ceo 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:54.960
 performed 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.459
 so we can even 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.459
 demonstrate here 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.409
 where you click 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.589
 twice and it will appear 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.649
 the folder two goals 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:09.449
 and in it you choose here the way your central 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.419
 how is it that you 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.890
 fortunately 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.719
 until the access to the gate 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.659
 the owner of the navigator I can then enter this path directly, this is how 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:20.819
 it's made for 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.219
 to set up 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.659
 in the central case I think there 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.560
 ex-leader and back the main menu there you can have access directly here 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.909
 on the screen 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.409
 here too short 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.989
 another directly 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.369
 on here 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:37.989
 in the central 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.629
 then through ipsep to give a click 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.649
 and he will obviously enter 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.299
 here in gt it adds 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.479
 the repertoire will have to recognize that he is a hard worker 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.029
 here you have the possibility to put the cart there and things like this 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.779
 nature 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.429
 one thing that 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.579
 for whom life in this world of technology 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.989
 at his house 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.729
 which operation 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.349
 we have there 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.629
 interesting 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.199
 I think he has it already knows well the working lack really demonstrate 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.489
 I got 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.120
 Kleber 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.559
 lc 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.479
 third selection of 8 8 points 3 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.330
 point 4 and already exists 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
 version 8 3 points 5 that the variant 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.919
 then the team used in health point 3 point 4 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.290
 and we have other 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.999
 options as music that you can choose from 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:40.009
 directly on the card reading is the holo car ' 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.680
 and if the accident happened 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.099
 it is not touched that the songs 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.120
 has the radio 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.120
 which can be 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.849
 through the controls on the steering wheel that not only the world 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.409
 who left the entire regional power station and 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.099
 without any problem 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.839
 the action will also change from here all the commands work 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.599
 all the commands in the account that the control 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.099
 we spent here father too 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.099
 with this modification because here in dvd 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.050
 also works the most so that the person can 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.900
 The thesis should work. 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.740
 dodo was the workforce etc. 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.839
 not to modify 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.080
 relates 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.699
 on the move she said against the law 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.800
 but how do people do this? 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.059
 with intent to use procon 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.419
 passenger similar thing 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.539
 looking 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.710
 we got there again so we checked here 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.860
 very good central change gives a very 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.729
 very cool car 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.529
 and everything works in the camera must have 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.099
 at this time that they 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.529
 if so on that day 6 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.659
 complete here any person who has 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.750
 it will actually make these quite common 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.099
 which shows that I changed from the central 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.710
 the tam also here inside the glove box made against the double Italian cables 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.120
 the car was also are two usb cables also in the central place you place here 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.520
 we were more comfortable 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.659
 it's working
