the<00:00:41.250> action<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.590> but

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the action here is not just the up but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
the action here is not just the up but
the<00:00:44.670> pulling<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> legs<00:00:45.719> together<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
down a lot of kids can get up there but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
down a lot of kids can get up there but
then<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.309> land<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:50.850> jumps<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
then when they land these jumps and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
then when they land these jumps and
leaps<00:00:51.629> their<00:00:51.930> feet<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.320> apart<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
leaps their feet are apart and then of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
leaps their feet are apart and then of
course<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> wolf<00:00:54.449> shape<00:00:57.260> make<00:00:58.260> sure<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
course the wolf shape make sure that the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
course the wolf shape make sure that the
arms<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.059> reaching<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.750> past<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.559> foot<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
arms are reaching out past the foot and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
arms are reaching out past the foot and
then<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.239> foot<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> pointed<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.070> by

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then the back foot is pointed and up by

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.350 
then the back foot is pointed and up by
the<00:01:05.309> rear<00:01:05.640> end<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.150> both<00:01:06.930> knees<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.650> together

the rear end and both knees are together

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
the rear end and both knees are together
and<00:01:10.189> then<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.119> advanced

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and then we go to the more advanced

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.240 
and then we go to the more advanced
which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> switch<00:01:13.560> split<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:17.070> want

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
which is the switch split and you want

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.820 
which is the switch split and you want
to<00:01:17.340> try<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.380> second

flat on the floor I want you to notice

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.080 
flat on the floor I want you to notice
how<00:01:51.090> she<00:01:51.149> crosses<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> ankles<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.670> work<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
how she crosses at the ankles to work on

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
how she crosses at the ankles to work on
the<00:01:54.210> alignment<00:01:54.630> instead<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> having<00:01:55.770> them<00:01:55.950> go

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the alignment instead of having them go

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
the alignment instead of having them go
side<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.670> side<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> bring<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
side by side and bring it out to the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.910 
side by side and bring it out to the
side<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.549> helps<00:02:00.119> keep<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> leg<00:02:01.500> going

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
side this helps keep the leg going

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.450 
side this helps keep the leg going
straight<00:02:02.399> over<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.939> head<00:02:03.500> working<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:05.070> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
straight over the head working more of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
straight over the head working more of
the<00:02:05.939> hamstring<00:02:06.600> stretch<00:02:07.049> versus<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the hamstring stretch versus out to the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.990 
the hamstring stretch versus out to the
side

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
side

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.020 
side
then<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:11.020> do<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> straddle<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.070> again<00:02:12.400> it's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
then we do the straddle and again it's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.470 
then we do the straddle and again it's
open<00:02:13.360> quick<00:02:13.990> let<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.560> Ram<00:02:14.950> open<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.790> then<00:02:16.180> pull

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
open quick let it Ram open and then pull

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.960 
open quick let it Ram open and then pull
the<00:02:16.630> legs<00:02:16.840> back<00:02:17.200> together<00:02:17.760> aggressively<00:02:18.760> so

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
the legs back together aggressively so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.730 
the legs back together aggressively so
you're<00:02:19.120> getting<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> inner<00:02:19.660> thighs<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
you're getting the inner thighs on the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.830 
you're getting the inner thighs on the
way<00:02:20.890> back<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.190> wolf<00:02:24.460> same<00:02:25.240> series

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
way back and then the wolf same series

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.750 
way back and then the wolf same series
is<00:02:26.050> what<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.350> did<00:02:26.530> before<00:02:28.860> legs<00:02:29.860> together<00:02:30.160> then

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
is what we did before legs together then

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
is what we did before legs together then
roll<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.780> rear-end<00:02:32.200> actually<00:02:32.709> comes

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
roll up so the rear-end actually comes

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.180 
roll up so the rear-end actually comes
off<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.520> floor<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:35.080> see<00:02:35.320> Cassie<00:02:35.770> straight

and<00:04:05.700> then<00:04:06.209> right<00:04:06.450> into<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> wolf<00:04:07.080> shape

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.720 

eliminate<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.050> much<00:04:13.290> swing<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.860> possible<00:04:14.519> so

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
eliminate as much swing as possible so

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.220 
eliminate as much swing as possible so
they're<00:04:14.880> working<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.360> muscles<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.079> not

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
they're working the muscles and not

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.289 
they're working the muscles and not
using<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.799> swing<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.459> create<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.060> shapes<00:04:18.450> and

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
using the swing to create the shapes and

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.390 
using the swing to create the shapes and
then<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.660> advanced<00:04:22.320> would<00:04:22.470> be<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.919> switch

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
then the advanced would be the switch

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.940 
then the advanced would be the switch
split<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:25.729> again<00:04:27.110> trying<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.260> get<00:04:28.440> through

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
split and again trying to get through

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.350 
split and again trying to get through
and<00:04:30.229> then<00:04:31.229> split<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.979> leg<00:04:32.520> has<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.880> come

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
and then split that leg has to come

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.560 
and then split that leg has to come
through<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.690> 90<00:04:34.169> degrees
