car roof lights off okay so we got here
is<00:00:30.499> a<00:00:30.550> EMF<00:00:31.550> detector<00:00:32.450> stands<00:00:32.960> for

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
is a EMF detector stands for

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.590 
is a EMF detector stands for
electromagnetic<00:00:33.380> field<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.520> those<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:35.360> people

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
electromagnetic field of those so people

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.620 
electromagnetic field of those so people
don't<00:00:35.810> know<00:00:36.220> so<00:00:37.220> what<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.520> does<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.700> uh<00:00:37.910> it

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
don't know so what it does is uh it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.420 
don't know so what it does is uh it
pretty<00:00:39.080> much<00:00:39.320> detects<00:00:39.980> any<00:00:40.130> electricity
