00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.450
 woo lee 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:29.210
 Those who carry so tightly wrapped in its know-how taken even what I see gyesinde 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:36.050
 What kind of equipment is used and how to use it? 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:41.750
 I think I can share a lot and get better on the basis of it. 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.379
 We should compete with the fact that the resulting image 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.890
 Through that image, 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:57.590
 You can continue to stimulate better photos, more unique ideas and more unique 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 I think it should be able to compete and stimulate the atmosphere. 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.620
 U 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:12.770
 I was alone without an assistant running steel. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:19.070
 If shooting techniques are good , it is very good. 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:23.690
 I thought about it, so I share it with other people. 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:29.360
 The fact that I found a way to be more helpful 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.599
 I think it's a story about advertising and photography. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 That's what made it through. 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:41.060
 In fact, it's all about equipment. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:48.679
 It's like some kind of bang 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:53.110
 I think the picture is not a device fight, it really is an idea fight. 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.110
 A unique color of your own 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:11.989
 In fact, there are already many cars and certain specific product areas 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:17.300
 It draws on its own and it has a fairly real sense of reality. 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:23.330
 Well, that's not what I 'm concerned about. 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:28.630
 I think the advertiser and my customers are the ones to judge it. 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 Until now, there has been a realistic 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.579
 A warm image 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.579
 I think I come to me because I need it . 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.720
 Yes, you are mistaken. 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.020
 Your work is not pure personal work 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:56.690
 Such a photo on the advertisement 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:59.390
 That's why photographers take such creativity 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.490
 That Bob would know 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:10.640
 Give me that kind of language . 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:14.120
 I think so. Advertising photographs are actually more 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.620
 I want them to get back to them 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.760
 So much hard party atmosphere makes dreams 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:30.140
 Each one is not simply bright and dark. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:35.840
 Note feeling so different made 'in the same way as a product photo 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:43.700
 It's a very subtle issue and a young issue. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 Yes , that's the way it's filled up during this sprawling process. 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:58.640
 To do this, use the fact that Flash is also fast two-time illustration that lighting 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.920
 It is also a very high-definition, but it is possible to shoot continuously such a DSLR 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.280
 Using the body 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.280
 You have to take a series of shots and capture them. 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:19.640
 The studios are a lot harder, but still some Photoshop 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.900
 e of any post-processing that is 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:31.490
 There's a lot of ads that do not fit in a little bit . 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:33.530
 Many designers who pursue a certain quality in their images are in fact my advertisers 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.260
 I see it. 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:43.420
 They 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:51.250
 And you know what those designers who are there on the advertising of the big companies 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:55.720
 Even if the image because what that will do the best atmosphere that used 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:06.090
 I think it's a passion. 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:06.090
 Ah cool cool 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:25.390
 Thank you very much. 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.390
