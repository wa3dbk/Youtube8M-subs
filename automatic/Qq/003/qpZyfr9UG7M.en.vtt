00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
there has been a gigantic influx of

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.540 
there has been a gigantic influx of
information<00:00:18.550> on<00:00:18.640> something<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:19.090> see<00:00:19.330> Tom<00:00:19.779> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
information on something in see Tom and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.190 
information on something in see Tom and
it's<00:00:21.550> very<00:00:21.760> late<00:00:21.939> for<00:00:22.150> me<00:00:22.240> right<00:00:22.540> now<00:00:22.570> but<00:00:22.990> it's

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
it's very late for me right now but it's

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.380 
it's very late for me right now but it's
so<00:00:23.770> important<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.430> had<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.880> make<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.029> video<00:00:25.150> to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
so important I had to make a video to

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.960 
so important I had to make a video to
show<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.890> turns<00:00:27.160> out<00:00:27.310> that<00:00:27.369> what<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
show you it turns out that what the

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.300 
show you it turns out that what the
Bellman's<00:00:28.329> chart<00:00:28.660> shows<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.740> it<00:00:29.919> shows<00:00:30.099> deep

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
Bellman's chart shows is it shows deep

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.780 
Bellman's chart shows is it shows deep
sea<00:00:30.550> ocean<00:00:30.760> currents<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:32.190> so<00:00:33.190> basically<00:00:33.699> it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
sea ocean currents and so basically it

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.110 
sea ocean currents and so basically it
says<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:34.510> on<00:00:34.780> these<00:00:35.199> specific<00:00:35.920> times<00:00:36.519> of<00:00:36.879> day

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
says that on these specific times of day

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.960 
says that on these specific times of day
in<00:00:37.360> these<00:00:37.540> certain<00:00:37.780> places<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:39.070> junk<00:00:39.580> from

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
in these certain places just junk from

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.600 
in these certain places just junk from
rapture<00:00:40.449> will<00:00:40.690> be<00:00:40.809> carried<00:00:41.800> by<00:00:42.220> these<00:00:42.400> deep

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
rapture will be carried by these deep

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.720 
rapture will be carried by these deep
sea<00:00:42.820> currents<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:44.050> these<00:00:44.199> locations<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.610> so

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
sea currents to these locations and so

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.670 
sea currents to these locations and so
