making the hair flat around the perm rod
so<00:01:49.439> i<00:01:50.090> roll<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.329> few<00:01:51.479> times<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> bottom

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so i roll it a few times at the bottom

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.800 
so i roll it a few times at the bottom
just<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.430> hair<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:53.759> catch<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.630> i

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just so the hair will catch and then i

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.100 
just so the hair will catch and then i
just<00:01:54.840> roll<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> my<00:01:56.369> scalp

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
just roll it all the way to my scalp

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.860 
just roll it all the way to my scalp
until<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.500> perm<00:01:58.770> rod<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.250> secure

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.720 

now<00:02:04.870> slowed<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:05.530> for<00:02:05.980> all<00:02:06.100> my<00:02:06.310> visual

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
now slowed it down for all my visual

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.880 
now slowed it down for all my visual

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110

pace

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.870 

now<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.020> let<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> perm<00:02:26.890> rod<00:02:27.100> sit<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.490> my<00:02:27.640> head

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.540 
now I let the perm rod sit in my head
overnight<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:30.010> used<00:02:31.050> about<00:02:32.050> 64<00:02:32.920> perm<00:02:33.220> rods

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
overnight and I used about 64 perm rods

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.090 
overnight and I used about 64 perm rods
and<00:02:33.970> all<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.810> take<00:02:35.290> them<00:02:35.440> down<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.950> I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
and all I do is take them down and I

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.800 
and all I do is take them down and I
just<00:02:36.370> separate<00:02:36.880> them<00:02:36.910> wear<00:02:37.240> my<00:02:37.570> hair

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
just separate them wear my hair

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.590 
just separate them wear my hair
naturally<00:02:38.440> falls<00:02:38.980> apart<00:02:39.460> then<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.210> kind<00:02:40.450> of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
naturally falls apart then I kind of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.270 
naturally falls apart then I kind of
twirl<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.410> if<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.740> lose<00:02:41.950> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
twirl them just so if you lose the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.250 
twirl them just so if you lose the
pattern<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.300> perm<00:02:43.510> rods<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.140> bounced<00:02:44.470> back

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
pattern of the perm rods it bounced back

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.440 
pattern of the perm rods it bounced back
now<00:02:47.260> after<00:02:47.520> separating<00:02:48.520> them<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.790> fluff<00:02:49.300> them

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
