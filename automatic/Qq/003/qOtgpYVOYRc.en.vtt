00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.940 
craze thing caught on it took a while to
get<00:02:16.970> underway<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> car<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.800> so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
get underway because the car was so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.400 
get underway because the car was so
unusual<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.670> people<00:02:20.060> had<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.480> get<00:02:20.630> used<00:02:21.260> to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
unusual and people had to get used to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.530 
unusual and people had to get used to
this<00:02:21.590> idea<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.459> car<00:02:22.700> designed<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.390> look

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
this idea of a car designed to look

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.320 
this idea of a car designed to look
small<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.620> big<00:02:24.860> inside<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.300> a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
small but be big inside to have a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.730 
small but be big inside to have a
transverse<00:02:26.900> engine<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.440> where<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.650> were

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
transverse engine and where you were

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.620 
transverse engine and where you were
stacked<00:02:28.010> much<00:02:28.340> nearer<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> front<00:02:29.060> normally

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
stacked much nearer the front normally

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:43.900 
stacked much nearer the front normally
would<00:02:29.870> be<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:32.300> idea<00:02:42.250> many<00:02:43.250> attempts<00:02:43.760> that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
would be the idea many attempts that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.460 
would be the idea many attempts that
many<00:02:44.120> derivatives<00:02:44.660> were<00:02:44.959> stopped<00:02:45.260> at<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
many derivatives were stopped at the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.010 
many derivatives were stopped at the
prototype<00:02:46.010> stage<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:47.150> one<00:02:47.390> designed<00:02:47.870> by

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
something sporty you can see why it

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.530 
something sporty you can see why it

had<00:03:41.970> minions<00:03:42.330> when<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:42.840> first<00:03:43.050> came<00:03:43.230> out<00:03:43.410> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
had minions when they first came out and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.620 
had minions when they first came out and
I<00:03:44.430> thought<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.790> was<00:03:44.850> about<00:03:44.970> time<00:03:45.270> they<00:03:45.450> put

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
I thought it was about time they put

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.470 
I thought it was about time they put
more<00:03:45.780> power<00:03:46.020> into<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.910> went<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.300> see<00:03:48.390> if

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
more power into it and I went to see if

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.540 
more power into it and I went to see if
he<00:03:48.569> go<00:03:48.720> Ennis<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.950> went<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.310> George

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
he go Ennis and we went to see George

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.910 
he go Ennis and we went to see George
Harriman<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:52.230> take<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.530> way<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.800> do<00:03:52.890> it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
Harriman and to take one way and do it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.979 
Harriman and to take one way and do it
took<00:03:53.340> one<00:03:53.459> away<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.700> put<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.150> our<00:03:54.239> racing

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
took one away and put one of our racing

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.030 
took one away and put one of our racing
in<00:03:55.110> this<00:03:55.950> break
