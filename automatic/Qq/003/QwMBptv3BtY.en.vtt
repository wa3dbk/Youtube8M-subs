myself<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.650> here<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.269> is<00:02:22.450> nice

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
myself out here and this is nice

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.680 
myself out here and this is nice
remember<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.849> on<00:02:24.970> road<00:02:25.330> tires

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690

blue<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.130> looks<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.610> car<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.819> going

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
blue and it looks like the car is going

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.610 
blue and it looks like the car is going
to<00:04:00.120> bed<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> ground<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.319> actually

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
to bed in and the ground but actually

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.750 
to bed in and the ground but actually
doesn't<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.130> turn<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.459> cart

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
doesn't just turn the cart

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.449 
doesn't just turn the cart
it's<00:04:03.450> fine<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.170> it's<00:04:04.319> like<00:04:04.440> trash<00:04:04.799> control<00:04:05.280> in

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
it's fine so it's like trash control in

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.670 
it's fine so it's like trash control in
Reverse<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.480> car<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.959> actually<00:04:07.110> doing<00:04:07.560> the
