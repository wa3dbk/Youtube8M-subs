00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
see Hogan versus savage but it would

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.420 
see Hogan versus savage but it would

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
bring in a lot of money because people

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.550 
bring in a lot of money because people
know<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.209> history<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.660> those<00:02:35.870> two<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.290> it

know the history of those two and it
would<00:02:36.800> be<00:02:36.920> interesting<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.459> those<00:02:37.640> two

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
would be interesting to see those two

would be interesting to see those two
even<00:02:38.060> face-to-face<00:02:38.630> even<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:38.990> there<00:02:39.110> wasn't<00:02:39.350> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
even face-to-face even if there wasn't a

of verbal war between the two of them
basically<00:02:47.600> part<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.080> reason<00:02:48.380> why<00:02:48.410> savage

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
basically part of the reason why savage

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.300 
basically part of the reason why savage
hates<00:02:49.970> Hogan<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.600> because<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.530> fact<00:02:51.770> is<00:02:52.040> he

whole NWO thing you know you would see

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.690 
whole NWO thing you know you would see
on<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:15.140> NWO<00:03:15.590> would<00:03:15.709> do<00:03:15.830> things<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.190> pour<00:03:16.489> hot

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.190 
on the NWO would do things like pour hot
coffee<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.180> people<00:03:17.630> while<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.870> actually

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
coffee on people while it actually

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.759 
coffee on people while it actually
wouldn't<00:03:18.380> be<00:03:18.500> hot<00:03:18.709> it'd<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.220> coffee<00:03:19.519> um<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:21.560> it

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
wouldn't be hot it'd be coffee um but it

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.650 
wouldn't be hot it'd be coffee um but it
wouldn't<00:03:22.040> be<00:03:22.100> hot<00:03:22.280> it'd<00:03:22.519> be<00:03:22.850> cool<00:03:23.090> down<00:03:23.360> and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.180 
wouldn't be hot it'd be cool down and
you<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.590> actually<00:03:24.890> gonna<00:03:24.950> hurt

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
you know so it's not actually gonna hurt

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.640 
you know so it's not actually gonna hurt
the<00:03:25.280> guys<00:03:25.540> sometimes<00:03:26.540> Hogan<00:03:26.930> would<00:03:27.049> do<00:03:27.200> douchy

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the guys sometimes Hogan would do douchy

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.830 
the guys sometimes Hogan would do douchy
things<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.489> microwave<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.239> coffee<00:03:29.450> and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840

things and like microwave the coffee and
actually<00:03:30.380> throw<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.769> on<00:03:30.980> Randy<00:03:31.430> Savage<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.660> he

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
actually throw it on Randy Savage so he

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.199 
actually throw it on Randy Savage so he
legitimately<00:03:33.290> threw<00:03:33.950> hot<00:03:34.280> coffee<00:03:34.310> on<00:03:34.760> Randy

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
legitimately threw hot coffee on Randy

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.530 
legitimately threw hot coffee on Randy
Savage<00:03:35.450> um<00:03:36.310> when<00:03:37.310> they<00:03:37.850> would<00:03:38.030> use<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.330> spray

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
Savage um when they would use the spray

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.509 
Savage um when they would use the spray
paint<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.930> NWO<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.709> water-based<00:03:40.220> paint

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
paint the NWO like a water-based paint

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.539 
paint the NWO like a water-based paint
that<00:03:40.730> would<00:03:40.880> wash<00:03:41.090> off<00:03:41.390> pretty<00:03:41.660> quickly

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
that would wash off pretty quickly

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.830 
that would wash off pretty quickly
holding<00:03:43.549> sometimes<00:03:44.060> when<00:03:44.329> he<00:03:44.390> put<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.660> yellow

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
holding sometimes when he put the yellow

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.750 
holding sometimes when he put the yellow
streak<00:03:45.200> up<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.500> savage<00:03:45.860> back<00:03:46.040> for<00:03:46.340> instance

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
baseball bat it was supposed to be like

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.140 
baseball bat it was supposed to be like
almost<00:04:00.500> like<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.739> plastic<00:04:00.980> bat<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.970> actually

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
almost like a plastic bat you actually

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.090 
almost like a plastic bat you actually
hit<00:04:02.450> savage<00:04:02.720> with<00:04:03.019> an<00:04:03.140> aluminum<00:04:03.410> bat<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.980> was<00:04:04.040> a

hit savage with an aluminum bat it was a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.759 
hit savage with an aluminum bat it was a
real<00:04:04.310> bat<00:04:04.579> so<00:04:05.329> reasons<00:04:06.019> what<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.680> I

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
real bat so reasons what like that is I

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.350 
real bat so reasons what like that is I
think<00:04:06.829> partly<00:04:07.220> why<00:04:07.459> Randy<00:04:07.730> Savage<00:04:08.000> went<00:04:08.329> a

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
think partly why Randy Savage went a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.430 
think partly why Randy Savage went a
little<00:04:08.480> local<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:09.230> his<00:04:09.350> head<00:04:09.579> but<00:04:11.079> anyways<00:04:12.079> um

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
little local in his head but anyways um

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.120 
little local in his head but anyways um
I<00:04:13.040> figure<00:04:14.030> if<00:04:14.209> they<00:04:14.390> will<00:04:14.630> do<00:04:15.170> savage<00:04:15.739> vs.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I figure if they will do savage vs.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.610 
I figure if they will do savage vs.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
TNA like DNA because the fact is they're

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.159 
TNA like DNA because the fact is they're

that other stuff so which it mean makes
sense<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.210> know<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.479> not<00:05:35.570> as<00:05:35.720> it's<00:05:36.110> not<00:05:36.289> as

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
sense you know it's not as it's not as

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.080 
sense you know it's not as it's not as
you<00:05:36.979> know<00:05:37.099> it's<00:05:37.849> not<00:05:38.030> as<00:05:38.180> draining<00:05:38.660> so<00:05:40.090> they're

you know it's not as draining so they're

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.089

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
is I've heard 8 to 10 but i'm pretty

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.740 
is I've heard 8 to 10 but i'm pretty
sure<00:05:51.560> it's<00:05:51.770> going<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.919> be<00:05:52.039> 12<00:05:52.360> TNA<00:05:53.360> is<00:05:53.419> going<00:05:53.690> to

sure it's going to be 12 TNA is going to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.950 
sure it's going to be 12 TNA is going to
do<00:05:53.900> two<00:05:54.139> weeks<00:05:54.410> worth<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.800> impact<00:05:55.250> taping<00:05:55.960> like

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
do two weeks worth of impact taping like

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.390 
do two weeks worth of impact taping like
they<00:05:57.110> have<00:05:57.289> been<00:05:57.530> normally<00:05:57.889> doing<00:05:58.099> and

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
they have been normally doing and

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.930 
they have been normally doing and
they're<00:05:58.820> going<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.000> have<00:05:59.240> one<00:05:59.710> impact<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:01.460> is

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
they're going to have one impact that is

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.790 
they're going to have one impact that is
going<00:06:02.240> to<00:06:02.330> be<00:06:02.419> on<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.660> road<00:06:02.840> somewhere<00:06:03.139> that

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
going to be on the road somewhere that

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.529 
going to be on the road somewhere that
one<00:06:04.130> impact<00:06:04.639> that's<00:06:04.910> going<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.150> be<00:06:05.240> on<00:06:05.389> the

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
one impact that's going to be on the

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.140 
one impact that's going to be on the
road<00:06:05.780> is<00:06:06.199> going<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:06.979> be<00:06:07.099> ill<00:06:07.280> once<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.699> month<00:06:07.910> and

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
road is going to be ill once a month and

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.460 
road is going to be ill once a month and
basically<00:06:08.930> it's<00:06:10.539> probably<00:06:11.539> supposed<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.349> be

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
basically it's probably supposed to be

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.140 
basically it's probably supposed to be
how<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.800> looks<00:06:12.979> now<00:06:13.070> is<00:06:13.400> it'll<00:06:13.580> be<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:13.760> impact

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
how it looks now is it'll be the impact

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.990 
how it looks now is it'll be the impact
before<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.840> pay-per-view<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:16.490> impact

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
before the pay-per-view and that impact

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.490 
before the pay-per-view and that impact
is<00:06:17.180> going<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.389> be<00:06:17.449> somewhere<00:06:17.840> near<00:06:18.260> where<00:06:18.410> the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
is going to be somewhere near where the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.890 
is going to be somewhere near where the
pay-per-view<00:06:18.860> is<00:06:19.099> going<00:06:19.310> to<00:06:19.370> be<00:06:19.490> held<00:06:20.270> not

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
pay-per-view is going to be held not

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.290 
pay-per-view is going to be held not
necessarily<00:06:21.380> exactly<00:06:21.889> in<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.370> same<00:06:22.580> city<00:06:22.970> but

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
necessarily exactly in the same city but

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.939 
necessarily exactly in the same city but
in<00:06:23.389> the<00:06:23.510> same<00:06:23.780> state<00:06:24.169> or<00:06:24.470> hopefully<00:06:24.800> if<00:06:24.860> they

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
in the same state or hopefully if they

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.629 
in the same state or hopefully if they
get<00:06:25.099> up<00:06:25.190> to<00:06:25.220> Canada<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:25.820> same<00:06:26.000> province<00:06:26.300> um

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
get up to Canada the same province um

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.240 
get up to Canada the same province um
but<00:06:28.639> it<00:06:29.300> looks<00:06:29.720> like<00:06:29.840> it<00:06:30.229> probably<00:06:30.949> will<00:06:31.070> be

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
but it looks like it probably will be

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.450 
but it looks like it probably will be
live<00:06:31.550> on<00:06:32.110> every<00:06:33.110> impact<00:06:33.590> that<00:06:33.800> is<00:06:34.010> going<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.340> be

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
live on every impact that is going to be

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.560 
live on every impact that is going to be
in<00:06:34.640> a<00:06:34.729> new<00:06:34.909> city<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:35.870> a<00:06:35.930> monthly<00:06:36.620> basis<00:06:37.250> is

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
in a new city on a monthly basis is

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.100 
in a new city on a monthly basis is
supposed<00:06:38.570> to<00:06:38.780> be

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
supposed to be

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.800 
supposed to be
probably<00:06:39.590> going<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:39.800> be<00:06:40.210> live<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:41.600> it's<00:06:41.720> going

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
probably going to be live and it's going

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.600 
probably going to be live and it's going
to<00:06:41.900> be<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.110> impact<00:06:42.410> before<00:06:43.010> the<00:06:43.190> pay-per-view

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
to be the impact before the pay-per-view

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
to be the impact before the pay-per-view
I<00:06:44.200> like<00:06:45.200> that<00:06:45.410> idea<00:06:45.620> I<00:06:45.830> think<00:06:45.980> it's<00:06:46.280> good

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
I like that idea I think it's good

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.370 
I like that idea I think it's good
reports<00:06:47.630> are<00:06:47.780> saying<00:06:47.900> they're<00:06:48.110> going<00:06:48.230> to<00:06:48.290> do

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
reports are saying they're going to do

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.350 
reports are saying they're going to do
eight<00:06:48.590> to<00:06:48.770> ten<00:06:49.010> of<00:06:49.130> these<00:06:49.250> a<00:06:49.310> year<00:06:49.910> on<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:50.180> road

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
eight to ten of these a year on the road

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360 
eight to ten of these a year on the road
I<00:06:50.720> don't<00:06:51.620> think<00:06:51.800> they're<00:06:51.950> going<00:06:52.070> to<00:06:52.160> think

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
I don't think they're going to think

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.010 
I don't think they're going to think
they<00:06:52.640> don't<00:06:52.850> have<00:06:53.030> this<00:06:53.210> planned<00:06:53.510> out<00:06:53.750> yet

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
they don't have this planned out yet

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.090 
they don't have this planned out yet
because<00:06:54.260> they<00:06:54.380> haven't<00:06:54.530> done<00:06:54.770> it<00:06:54.920> they<00:06:55.010> don't

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
because they haven't done it they don't

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.220 
because they haven't done it they don't
know<00:06:55.250> what<00:06:55.370> to<00:06:55.400> go<00:06:55.670> on<00:06:55.850> I<00:06:56.180> think<00:06:56.930> what's<00:06:57.110> going

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
know what to go on I think what's going

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.690 
know what to go on I think what's going
to<00:06:57.320> happen<00:06:57.590> is<00:06:57.680> going<00:06:57.860> to<00:06:57.920> be<00:06:58.070> a<00:06:58.100> once<00:06:58.400> a<00:06:58.520> month

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
to happen is going to be a once a month

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.720 
to happen is going to be a once a month
thing<00:06:59.000> starting<00:06:59.900> after<00:07:00.050> lockdown<00:07:00.800> I<00:07:01.460> don't

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
thing starting after lockdown I don't

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.650 
thing starting after lockdown I don't
think<00:07:01.910> they're<00:07:02.000> going<00:07:02.090> to<00:07:02.150> do<00:07:02.300> it<00:07:02.390> right<00:07:02.510> away

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660

think they're going to do it right away
it<00:07:03.170> takes<00:07:03.350> time<00:07:03.710> and<00:07:03.740> I<00:07:04.190> think<00:07:04.340> it<00:07:04.430> will<00:07:04.490> be

it takes time and I think it will be

it takes time and I think it will be
probably<00:07:04.760> after<00:07:05.240> lockdown<00:07:05.480> will<00:07:05.930> see<00:07:06.080> it
