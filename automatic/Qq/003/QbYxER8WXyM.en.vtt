I'll go back and see if they've marked
um<00:02:12.890> down<00:02:13.159> and<00:02:13.489> then<00:02:13.579> Walmart<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.239> usually

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
um down and then Walmart is usually

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.400 
um down and then Walmart is usually
slow<00:02:15.410> about<00:02:16.270> discounting<00:02:17.270> them<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:18.110> further

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
slow about discounting them any further

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.580 
slow about discounting them any further
but<00:02:19.150> usually<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.300> would<00:02:20.450> be<00:02:20.510> about<00:02:20.780> 50%<00:02:21.140> off

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
but usually it would be about 50% off

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.230 
but usually it would be about 50% off
the<00:02:21.800> next<00:02:22.040> time<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.400> mark<00:02:22.640> them<00:02:22.820> down<00:02:22.940> so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
the next time they mark them down so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.910 
the next time they mark them down so
I'll<00:02:23.330> go<00:02:23.510> back<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.720> check<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.560> let's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
