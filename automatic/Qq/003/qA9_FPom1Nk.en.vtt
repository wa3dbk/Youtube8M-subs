00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 that here are one-way green brands 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.899
 So small burger rolls with oregano 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.760
 basil bit of parmesan is too 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 After the game they smell fantastic 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 and are very easy to do and how 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.250
 you do that that's in the wake 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.969
 by barbecue from Rheinhessen 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.969
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.190
 Here you can see the ingredients that we have 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.850
 need for our under green bands 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.870
 become 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.140
 Let's start with flour sugar milk butter 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.660
 sugar yeast the don marco at the green 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 then you need rapp and parmesan cheese 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.879
 a kitchen machine and then I would 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.960
 we say - let's go with that 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:14.119
 her 230 grams or also 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.710
 milliliters of milk, that is, if I am 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.150
 now no thermomix off you had to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.910
 maybe in the pot straight or one 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.130
 microwave lukewarm make it just that 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:27.619
 Butter has the opportunity to melt 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.140
 who here warm the milk to 37 degrees 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.790
 so that just melts the butter and then 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710
 it goes on if the milk then 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.800
 heated and the butter is melted 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 It should look and sink like this 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 we half the cubes of fresh yeast in the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.869
 liquid that still briefly through 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.580
 that just dissolve the fresh low ones 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.940
 can 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.950
 and then come 350 grams of flour in my 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.229
 case now 550er mail 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.800
 This is easy when baking bread 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.020
 better then a spoonful of sugar and follows 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.720
 two tablespoons of the don markus of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.300
 the greenback salzberg 1 need in the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.380
 That's why salt is already in there now 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.020
 there is no extra drum so makes two 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.630
 tablespoon with in the mixture and now 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.830
 Let's leave it for four minutes 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.280
 knead and then we'll look like 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.709
 it looks like 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.620
 after four minutes of turning the dough looks 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.520
 then go out and people it really is 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.569
 fantastic after oregano basil 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.840
 As I said the dough is now as 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.540
 Such was after her top stand now 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.230
 we still prepare the topping for 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.420
 the bands in front 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.440
 and this is how we see it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.319
 now the ingredients we use for that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.630
 then need topping parmesan cheese 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.170
 i here a rough and with that i have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.950
 Now a little bit of that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.860
 rapidly its shell this purely then 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.800
 comes as a tablespoon or 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 then two teaspoons of the wonderful 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.430
 above it and then I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.770
 The whole thing is not the dough now 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.700
 So the herbs could look so beautiful 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.680
 Pictures are incorporated and of the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.000
 we call each other now always dough 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
 small corner off as I said that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.450
 should be Japan for unfortunately so 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.700
 really for very little ones 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.739
 that's why burger does not need it 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.269
 really much antaike and 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.860
 Nonetheless, we will be back 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.680
 a little grind that means so 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.080
 you push a bit flat and folds 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.630
 then always the outside inwards 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.450
 so that's on the side 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.980
 Surface tension is created and pressed 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.709
 we still a bit flat 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.230
 and then the cheese in this rob 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.970
 Mixture depressed in orderly 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.650
 cheese is on top of it and then 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.549
 we put the on the baking sheet I ready 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 now quite normal before 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.329
 and then it continues to look our way 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.340
 wunder green were ready now 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.680
 I prepared from the oven 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.190
 up to 180 degrees there come the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.540
 now for a maximum of 25 minutes in and out 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.700
 then I'll show you something 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.739
 is 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.769
 and that's how it looks 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.329
 People I can tell you in the house 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.370
 fantastic for basil and oregano 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.180
 the absolute blast 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.220
 they also leave us a little bit 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.789
 cool down but they are absolutely 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.799
 Fantastic so there sit ours 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.810

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.590
