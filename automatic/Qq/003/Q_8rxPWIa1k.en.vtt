00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and then guys youtube today I will teach 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.300
 you invite all characters not to 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:27.470
 some three always used at the final moment 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:27.470
 first you go with low versus mode 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:38.770
 two controls and better combat you 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.770
 assets under control 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:55.800
 and you went maru got a control of the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:01.080
 access to fifa and you have to make some 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 settings at the beginning you sit start at 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 initial year but is given and adjusts 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 life of your opponent 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:20.040
 To me , you and I trade and have a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 specific place which is the fast at the end 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 Turner course you choose she is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 seeing if in the fall line care is taken 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.650
 you break the glass barrier many 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.780
 times is that it has no more life and you 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.160
 can play a component out of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:46.370
 lap and this makes the bay will give one 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.370
 average of 10 thousand euros for it you go 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 making 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:03.520
 the thesis of his opponent and said look 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:11.200
 to play daniel mameri from 9,700 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.190
 How many thousand bears do you make? 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.299
 this can already see and already has a lot of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 blocked titles 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.000
 Are you doing this? 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.019
 first my character you freed 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.510
 I ah sails but so is the old 7 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.420
 minutes and already starts to release character 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.650
 that the first admiral 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 you can see here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 the character only those who already sells it to 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.099
 school and see that there is no relationship 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 when free care and the third 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.500
 charge that are the first two will 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.060
 being on the dictionary side 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.060
 I think so 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.210
 to release all employees 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.210
 average of one hour and twenty or less 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:04:03.830
 This is what you should already release there. 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:03.830
 or until then you will play in that style 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:19.440
 of lap color gain an average of 9 to 17 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:22.950
 and 18 are to blame and from here is very fast 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.580
 the normal one sums up a fight sometimes the 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.840
 obvious that at the end is 8 thousand and 8 thousand a 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.820
 thing in this fight you more than 1,800 some 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.820
 often gives more money like this 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.680
 playing 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.570
 so this one is also a favor to the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.140
 abortion donation 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:34.040
 this was the hotel luck that I did not even 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:43.000
 I know how I did a good performance and I know 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:43.000
 that you arguing that brava reduces of him 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.960
 Wow 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:12.240
 My father was already there and he won a little bit 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:17.100
 above my prediction on so low so 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:21.930
 you defending control 26 defending 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:25.830
 control 2 and attacking the shop at the meeting 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.890
 Oh well, that's the area and then the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.220
 average of seven fights you already go 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.460
 get release minatto third or 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.100
 expensive the characters is more or 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.290
 less an hour and twenty was to win all 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.110
 A green hour or so. 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.740
 so this one of mine says to you 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.740
 roll there
