rust<00:00:44.210> this<00:00:45.210> car<00:00:45.450> does<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.079> issues

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
rust this car does have some issues

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.190 
rust this car does have some issues
basically<00:00:47.700> needs<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> full<00:00:48.300> exhaust<00:00:48.600> needs

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
basically needs a full exhaust needs

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
basically needs a full exhaust needs
some<00:00:49.410> brake<00:00:49.620> work<00:00:49.860> needs<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> suspension<00:00:51.180> work

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
some brake work needs to suspension work

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
some brake work needs to suspension work
means<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> full<00:00:52.079> tune-up<00:00:52.530> including<00:00:52.980> timing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
means a full tune-up including timing

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.150 
means a full tune-up including timing
belt<00:00:53.550> needs<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.450> interior<00:00:54.690> cleaning<00:00:55.200> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
belt needs an interior cleaning and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.850 
belt needs an interior cleaning and
there's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> check<00:00:56.850> engine<00:00:57.059> light<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.870> two

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
there's a check engine light on for two

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.490 
there's a check engine light on for two
codes<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.000> evap<00:01:00.390> system<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
codes one is the evap system and the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
codes one is the evap system and the
other<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.870> because<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.050> catalytic

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
other is because of the catalytic

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.100 
other is because of the catalytic
converter<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.300> does<00:01:06.479> require<00:01:06.690> some<00:01:06.840> work

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
converter so it does require some work

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.940 
converter so it does require some work
but<00:01:08.539> it's<00:01:09.539> certainly<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.380> buy-in<00:01:10.560> was

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but it's certainly what the buy-in was

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
but it's certainly what the buy-in was
cheap<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> car<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.890> come<00:01:14.190> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> look

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
cheap and the car did come if you look

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.609 
cheap and the car did come if you look
here<00:01:15.569> in<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.979> rear<00:01:18.020> car<00:01:19.020> did<00:01:19.200> come<00:01:19.410> with<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
here in the rear car did come with a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
here in the rear car did come with a
full<00:01:19.890> set<00:01:20.160> of<00:01:20.190> four<00:01:20.490> snow<00:01:20.759> tires

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
full set of four snow tires

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
full set of four snow tires
separately<00:01:21.929> mounted<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.740> those<00:01:23.729> were

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
separately mounted so those were

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.529 
separately mounted so those were
included<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.360> price<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:26.179> all<00:01:27.179> in<00:01:27.450> all

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
included in the price and all in all

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.029 
included in the price and all in all
even<00:01:27.810> though<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.289> more<00:01:28.830> work

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
even though it's going to be more work

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.230 
even though it's going to be more work
for<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.429> I<00:01:29.459> think<00:01:29.580> it's<00:01:29.729> gonna<00:01:29.819> be<00:01:29.940> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.179> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
for me I think it's gonna be kind of a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.949 
for me I think it's gonna be kind of a
bargain<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.849> actually<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.660> gonna<00:01:33.840> be

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
bargain now I'm actually not gonna be

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.719 
bargain now I'm actually not gonna be
doing<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.349> much<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.679> way<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.890> DIY<00:01:35.310> videos

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
doing too much in the way of DIY videos

a<00:01:38.310> couple<00:01:38.459> of<00:01:38.610> reasons<00:01:38.789> for<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.250> see

a couple of reasons for that you can see
the<00:01:41.490> front<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.789> car<00:01:41.910> it's<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.149> a

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
process but also there's the more

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.160 
process but also there's the more
practical<00:02:14.730> reason<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.330> I've<00:02:15.630> never<00:02:15.840> worked<00:02:16.050> on

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
practical reason of I've never worked on

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.710 
practical reason of I've never worked on
a<00:02:16.230> Volvo<00:02:16.620> before<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.300> there's<00:02:18.300> gonna<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> bit

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
a Volvo before so there's gonna be a bit

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.680 
a Volvo before so there's gonna be a bit
of<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> learning<00:02:18.959> curve<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.379> me<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
of a learning curve for me and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.200 
of a learning curve for me and
even<00:02:21.590> though<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.710> could<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.610> know<00:02:22.640> step<00:02:23.000> by

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
even though I could you know step by

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.990 
even though I could you know step by
step<00:02:23.510> people<00:02:23.840> through<00:02:24.440> repair<00:02:25.130> procedures<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
step people through repair procedures I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.360 
step people through repair procedures I
know<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:26.840> are<00:02:26.960> some<00:02:27.170> DIY<00:02:27.590> videos<00:02:27.950> already

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
know there are some DIY videos already

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
know there are some DIY videos already
out<00:02:28.640> there<00:02:28.850> for<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.150> car<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.690> don't<00:02:29.750> think

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
out there for this car and I don't think

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.570 
out there for this car and I don't think
I<00:02:30.200> could<00:02:30.410> improve<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.890> those<00:02:31.040> at<00:02:31.220> least<00:02:31.400> not

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
I could improve on those at least not

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.040 
I could improve on those at least not
yet<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:34.030> I'm<00:02:35.030> very<00:02:35.210> much<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.570> learning<00:02:35.810> mode

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
yet so I'm very much in learning mode

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.030 
yet so I'm very much in learning mode
but<00:02:36.320> as<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.770> maintain<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.460> car<00:02:37.700> long<00:02:38.030> term<00:02:38.450> I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
but as I maintain the car long term I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.470 
but as I maintain the car long term I
will<00:02:40.040> certainly<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.520> including<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.210> in<00:02:41.330> my

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
will certainly be including it in my

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.200 
will certainly be including it in my
videos<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.950> guess<00:02:43.550> I'd<00:02:43.670> kind<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
videos so I guess I'd kind of have to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.180 
videos so I guess I'd kind of have to
get<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.390> car<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.810> road<00:02:45.020> as<00:02:45.740> quick<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.100> I

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
get the car on the road as quick as I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.270 
get the car on the road as quick as I
can<00:02:46.250> which<00:02:47.320> more<00:02:48.320> or<00:02:48.380> less<00:02:48.410> negates<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
can which more or less negates the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.950 
can which more or less negates the
