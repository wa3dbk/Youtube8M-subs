00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
different transition effects such as

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.899 
different transition effects such as

clouds or bubbles drag it down as well
we'll<00:02:00.390> give<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.409> looks

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
we'll give that a go see what it looks

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.700 
we'll give that a go see what it looks
like<00:02:05.479> ok<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> looks<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.899> bit<00:02:07.020> frame<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.530> there

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
like ok it looks a bit frame me there

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.710 
like ok it looks a bit frame me there
but<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.369> ok<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
but that's ok because when it is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.260 
but that's ok because when it is
