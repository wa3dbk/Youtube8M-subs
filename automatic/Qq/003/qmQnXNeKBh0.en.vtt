down for the time being yep open fire on
the<00:01:30.570> ground<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> first<00:01:31.409> melee<00:01:32.040> rats<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.430> go

the ground and first melee rats will go
down<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.020 
down I think don't get it back off and
let<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> rest<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> momentum<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.820> I

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
that we talked about very early on

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:37.939 
that we talked about very early on
having<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.289> potential<00:06:37.590> she<00:06:37.800> just

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
having the potential she just

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.260 
having the potential she just
straight-up<00:06:38.130> to<00:06:38.340> take<00:06:38.460> all<00:06:38.699> the<00:06:38.789> towers<00:06:38.970> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
straight-up to take all the towers and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.150 
straight-up to take all the towers and
the<00:06:39.360> game<00:06:39.570> yep<00:06:39.960> and<00:06:40.229> that's<00:06:40.500> pretty<00:06:40.770> much<00:06:40.889> what

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
the game yep and that's pretty much what

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.980 
the game yep and that's pretty much what
they<00:06:41.250> did<00:06:41.430> it<00:06:41.610> wasn't<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.000> quickest<00:06:42.479> five<00:06:42.780> men

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
they did it wasn't the quickest five men

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.480 
they did it wasn't the quickest five men
that<00:06:43.199> ball<00:06:43.229> strategy<00:06:43.800> we've<00:06:43.919> ever<00:06:44.070> seen<00:06:44.280> took

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
that ball strategy we've ever seen took

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.860 
that ball strategy we've ever seen took
him<00:06:44.610> around<00:06:44.669> 38<00:06:45.150> minutes<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.510> win<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.720> game

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
him around 38 minutes to win the game

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.450 
him around 38 minutes to win the game
but<00:06:46.410> it<00:06:46.530> was<00:06:46.620> definitely<00:06:46.830> effective

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
but it was definitely effective

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.700 
but it was definitely effective
concerning<00:06:48.419> the<00:06:48.539> fact<00:06:48.750> that<00:06:48.870> they<00:06:49.289> gave<00:06:49.530> up

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710
