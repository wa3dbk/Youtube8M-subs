00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
you how you're going to start by

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.320 
you how you're going to start by
measuring<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.230> width<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:19.430> always<00:00:20.029> start

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
measuring the width you always start

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.270 
measuring the width you always start
with<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.510> width<00:00:20.810> in<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.280> professional

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
with the width in the professional

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.029 
with the width in the professional
industry<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.880> whip<00:00:23.090> always<00:00:23.600> comes<00:00:23.900> first<00:00:24.039> so

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
industry the whip always comes first so

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.220 
industry the whip always comes first so
if<00:00:25.280> your<00:00:25.430> window<00:00:25.789> was<00:00:26.110> 72<00:00:27.110> x<00:00:27.910> 90<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.900> wrote

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
if your window was 72 x 90 and you wrote

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.770 
if your window was 72 x 90 and you wrote
90<00:00:30.949> x<00:00:31.070> 72<00:00:31.640> they're<00:00:31.910> going<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.090> make<00:00:32.239> 90<00:00:32.629> the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
90 x 72 they're going to make 90 the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.840 
90 x 72 they're going to make 90 the
width<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.260> we're<00:00:33.379> going<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:33.559> start<00:00:33.860> with<00:00:34.129> the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
width so we're going to start with the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.370 
width so we're going to start with the
lip<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.620> just<00:00:36.620> measure<00:00:36.890> from<00:00:37.160> frame<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.550> frame

this window is thirty six and
three-quarters<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.140> want<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.440> use<00:00:42.560> a<00:00:42.590> good

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
three-quarters you want to use a good

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.490 
three-quarters you want to use a good
tape<00:00:43.460> measure<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:44.090> can<00:00:44.390> pull<00:00:44.960> out<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
tape measure that can pull out of the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.350 
tape measure that can pull out of the
long<00:00:45.680> distance<00:00:45.950> without<00:00:46.309> cracking<00:00:46.970> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
long distance without cracking and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.290 
long distance without cracking and
falling<00:00:47.510> over<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.280> soft<00:00:49.610> tape<00:00:49.910> measure<00:00:50.120> that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
falling over so a soft tape measure that

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.639 
falling over so a soft tape measure that
you<00:00:50.450> would<00:00:50.570> have<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.750> your<00:00:50.899> sewing<00:00:51.200> room<00:00:51.410> isn't

you would have in your sewing room isn't
the<00:00:52.250> dust<00:00:52.489> choice<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.660> 25-foot<00:00:54.410> tape

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
the dust choice this is a 25-foot tape

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.709 
the dust choice this is a 25-foot tape
measure<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.190> i<00:00:55.219> can<00:00:55.430> go<00:00:55.579> way<00:00:55.790> up<00:00:55.820> high<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:56.300> it

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
measure so i can go way up high with it

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.200 
measure so i can go way up high with it
and<00:00:56.899> far<00:00:57.290> across<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.460> 12-foot<00:00:59.000> tape

and far across but a 12-foot tape

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.660 
and far across but a 12-foot tape
measure<00:00:59.420> would<00:00:59.629> work<00:00:59.870> as<00:01:00.050> well<00:01:00.640> after<00:01:01.640> i

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
measure would work as well after i

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.580 
measure would work as well after i
measure<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.180> width<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.780> frame<00:01:02.960> i'm<00:01:03.379> going

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
measure the width of the frame i'm going

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.889 
measure the width of the frame i'm going
to<00:01:03.680> measure<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.460> frame<00:01:05.200> to<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.229> sill<00:01:07.899> i'm

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
to measure the frame to the sill i'm

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.539 
to measure the frame to the sill i'm
going<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.110> use<00:01:09.259> my<00:01:09.289> knee<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:10.010> pull<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.369> tape

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
going to use my knee to pull the tape

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.109 
going to use my knee to pull the tape
measure<00:01:10.760> out<00:01:11.170> like<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.610> come<00:01:13.610> down<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
measure out like this come down to the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.230 
measure out like this come down to the
sill<00:01:14.630> on<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.650> window<00:01:15.950> that's<00:01:16.159> 67<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.000> half

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
sill on this window that's 67 and a half

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.370 
sill on this window that's 67 and a half
this<00:01:17.960> would<00:01:18.170> be<00:01:18.200> for<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.770> sill<00:01:19.159> length<00:01:19.520> drapery

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
this would be for a sill length drapery

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.310 
this would be for a sill length drapery
you<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:21.530> also<00:01:21.740> measure<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.549> apron<00:01:23.090> and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
you can also measure to the apron and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.810 
you can also measure to the apron and
that's<00:01:24.320> about<00:01:24.500> 70<00:01:25.460> inches<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:27.549> still<00:01:28.549> length

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that's about 70 inches I still length

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.420 
that's about 70 inches I still length
drapery<00:01:29.450> falls<00:01:29.990> below<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.650> sill<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.280> this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
drapery falls below the sill on this

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.219 
drapery falls below the sill on this
window<00:01:31.850> maybe<00:01:32.210> not<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.479> great<00:01:32.750> idea<00:01:32.780> because

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
window maybe not a great idea because

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.080 
window maybe not a great idea because
the<00:01:33.500> sill<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.890> really<00:01:34.250> close<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.700> floor

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
the sill is really close to the floor

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.179 
the sill is really close to the floor
but<00:01:35.840> if<00:01:35.960> you're<00:01:36.110> still<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.560> higher<00:01:36.770> up<00:01:36.799> from

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
but if you're still is higher up from

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.280 
but if you're still is higher up from
the<00:01:37.310> floor<00:01:37.460> asil<00:01:38.030> length<00:01:38.240> grape<00:01:38.509> drapery<00:01:39.110> is

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the floor asil length grape drapery is

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.469 
the floor asil length grape drapery is
or<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.799> apron<00:01:40.369> length<00:01:40.580> drapery<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.210> great

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
or a apron length drapery is a great

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.230 
or a apron length drapery is a great
idea<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.140> then<00:01:42.770> go<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.310> way<00:01:43.340> down<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
idea and then go all the way down to the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.410 
idea and then go all the way down to the
floor<00:01:45.130> all<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.189> way<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.850> floor<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.180> this

floor all the way to the floor on this
window<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:47.990> 83<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.040> half<00:01:49.420> now<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.479> want<00:01:50.720> to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
window is 83 and a half now you want to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.149 
window is 83 and a half now you want to
think<00:01:50.990> about<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.680> type<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.920> window

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
think about what type of window

floor half inch you have to subtract a

half inch from that measurement you may

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.210 
half inch from that measurement you may

making a scalloped shape valance or
cornice<00:02:38.579> board<00:02:38.840> I'd<00:02:39.840> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> measure<00:02:40.530> from

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
too far down in the window but it'll

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.379 
too far down in the window but it'll
hide<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> window<00:02:49.200> frame<00:02:49.409> above<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:51.329> you

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
hide all the window frame above so you

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.849 
hide all the window frame above so you
want<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.659> think<00:02:51.689> about<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.139> shortest<00:02:52.560> point

and then the longest point for your

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.710 
and then the longest point for your
design<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.920> sketch<00:02:56.489> ahead<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.120> time<00:02:57.299> really

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
design a sketch ahead of time really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.229 
design a sketch ahead of time really
helps<00:02:58.169> before<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.310> start<00:02:59.370> measuring<00:02:59.819> or<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
helps before you start measuring or a
