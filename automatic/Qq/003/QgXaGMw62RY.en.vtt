00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi girls more sheet than today will be 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.140
 on the high sorbe of the s or these 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.630
 mousse eye shadows come out the wave 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.380
 so many colors are six 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 I have two of them 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.990
 the number one this illuminating yellow 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.410
 pineapple the number 4 illuminating plum 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 then I 'm a mousse really not 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 so much mus 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 these instead are in cream I would say one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.649
 normal cream because of the truth that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 is number one and this is number 4 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.380
 in the tutorial I did where he had 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910
 used I don't know if you remember not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 see what style the boy has me 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 said I love what 's right away 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.050
 a lot of kiko in the pineapple color 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 reality then it all came to mean 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 say pineapple actually issued what 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
 had used on gives me much more than you see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.129
 to the to the color plan 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.789
 this is the style you see 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.129
 compared to those of the essence is 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 obviously a little much more metallic with 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 the much larger chunks 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.830
 within the product alone I do not 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 instead they make you go crazy a lot more like 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 touch of light over the other eye shadows 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 only a few points of our 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 makeup therefore not all over the eyelid 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.009
 but I'll show you maybe I do 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 see cost precisely but see a 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.740
 little rituals over the yellow on the whole 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 eyelid 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.810
 I tried to use it it was just that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 just above the other eye shadows and I have to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.100
 say that it does not go into the fold however after a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 it's no longer as beautiful as it used to be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.509
 when we put it above all just given 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.070
 alone the effect you see is a lot 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.020
 bright but not excessive we say 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.850
 we say that used as well then they lose 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 a lot because anyway they just seem 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.110
 any metallic eye shadows 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.729
 instead they are much prettier used 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.829
 still above the shadows maybe 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.680
 dark precisely because it is not 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 however completely opaque but being 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.030
 however semi-transparent they leave 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.590
 glimpse 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.210
 the basic color of our eyeshadow e 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 we put it down and so I am a lot 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.510
 nicer and here for example to do 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.240
 see the setting above the blue pencil 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.100
 dark brown the price of 3 euros 49 e 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.479
 the color precisely which are six but they are 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.220
 very similar to each other despite being 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 how different we can mica green one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.030
 more rosy but a white one in the end is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 been transparent with these 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.080
 the effect on the eye is not so different 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.200
 on the other hand, so if you had to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.670
 advise I would say for one what more 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.970
 maybe it inspires this better with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.410
 your favorite colors and pasta girls 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.280
 so my face for this product 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 is six and a half drum roll six e 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.880
 half because anyway it seems to me 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.130
 that is not the metallic cream eyeshadow 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.019
 it won't make me crazy it will be too 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.970
 the fact that anyway when i have it 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.370
 tried to put that 3 4 times 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.110
 promised a nice day that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.050
 evening you could see a little less was a bit 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.870
 metallic eye shadow effect 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.000
 let's say faded so it's not really 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.000
 that entering my heart, however, nothing 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.239
 it is not bad as produced nice hello 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.239
 well
