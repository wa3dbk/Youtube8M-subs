00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:07.599 
so I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.629 
so I'm going to be talking about the
role<00:00:07.809> that<00:00:07.840> imaging<00:00:08.500> plays<00:00:08.800> in<00:00:09.070> hypertrophic

diagnostic<00:00:56.019> test<00:00:56.920> there<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:58.030> look<00:00:58.239> at<00:00:58.420> how

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
diagnostic test there we look at how

thick the heart muscle is because the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.660 
thick the heart muscle is because the
diagnosis<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.129> hypertrophic<00:01:03.489> cardiomyopathy

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.030 
diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
is<00:01:04.449> where<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.960> most<00:01:05.500> common<00:01:05.920> presentation

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
is where you most common presentation

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.380 
is where you most common presentation
where<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.700> have<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.270> thick<00:01:07.630> heart<00:01:07.960> muscle<00:01:08.410> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
where you have a thick heart muscle in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.520 
where you have a thick heart muscle in
absence<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.480> any<00:01:10.660> other<00:01:10.810> causes

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
so echo is excellent non-invasive you

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.230 
so echo is excellent non-invasive you
can<00:01:14.620> look<00:01:14.890> at<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.280> thickness<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.910> muscle

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
can look at the thickness of the muscle

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.780 
can look at the thickness of the muscle
you<00:01:16.390> can<00:01:16.570> look<00:01:16.750> at<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.110> mitral<00:01:17.920> valve<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.760> you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
you can look at the mitral valve and you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.150 
you can look at the mitral valve and you
can<00:01:19.570> look<00:01:19.720> at<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.170> structures<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.710> support

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
procedure along with that these imaging

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.300 
procedure along with that these imaging
techniques<00:03:31.270> also<00:03:31.660> give<00:03:31.900> us<00:03:32.080> an<00:03:32.320> idea<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> what

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
techniques also give us an idea of what

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.090 
techniques also give us an idea of what
the<00:03:33.910> potential<00:03:34.480> risk<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:35.080> dying<00:03:35.350> suddenly<00:03:35.830> is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the potential risk for dying suddenly is

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.880 
the potential risk for dying suddenly is
why<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.090> important<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.780> because<00:03:38.080> if<00:03:38.440> you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
why that is important is because if you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.620 
why that is important is because if you
as<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.100> patient<00:03:39.370> are<00:03:39.760> at<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:40.030> slightly<00:03:40.330> higher

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
as a patient are at a slightly higher

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.470 
as a patient are at a slightly higher
risk<00:03:40.900> then<00:03:41.830> we<00:03:42.160> can<00:03:42.340> put<00:03:42.520> in<00:03:42.640> an<00:03:42.760> ICD<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
risk then we can put in an ICD a

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.080 
risk then we can put in an ICD a
defibrillator<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.440> help<00:03:45.040> prevent<00:03:45.640> sudden

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
defibrillator and help prevent sudden

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.750 
defibrillator and help prevent sudden
cardiac<00:03:46.300> death<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.440> also<00:03:47.760> correct

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
cardiac death and it also correct

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.009 
cardiac death and it also correct
diagnosis<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.330> hypertrophic<00:03:49.840> cardiomyopathy

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.680 
diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
health<00:03:50.830> in<00:03:51.220> giving<00:03:51.820> lifestyle

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
health in giving lifestyle

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.259 
health in giving lifestyle
recommendations<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.650> whether<00:03:54.489> or<00:03:54.610> not<00:03:54.730> you

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
recommendations and whether or not you

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.540 
recommendations and whether or not you
need<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.480> avoid<00:03:55.810> competitive<00:03:56.470> sports<00:03:56.769> or<00:03:57.010> not

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
need to avoid competitive sports or not

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.600 
need to avoid competitive sports or not
so<00:03:57.930> imaging<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.080> vital<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.160> disease

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
so imaging is vital in this disease

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.120 
so imaging is vital in this disease
