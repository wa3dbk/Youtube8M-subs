three<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.799> pretty<00:01:22.799> good<00:01:23.009> map<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.549> matchup

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
three a pretty good map for this matchup

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.050 
three a pretty good map for this matchup
I'd<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.950> wouldn't<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I'd say I really wouldn't say it's that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240 
I'd say I really wouldn't say it's that
advantaged<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
advantaged well actually you know I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
advantaged well actually you know I
would<00:01:29.549> probably<00:01:29.850> say<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.350> slightly

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
would probably say that it's slightly

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
would probably say that it's slightly
more<00:01:31.920> turn<00:01:32.490> avantage<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
more turn avantage but actually the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
more turn avantage but actually the
stats<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.770> bear<00:01:34.979> me<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.430> three<00:01:35.640> two

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
stats don't bear me out it's three two

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.840 
stats don't bear me out it's three two
one<00:01:35.970> three<00:01:36.810> games<00:01:37.079> won<00:01:37.979> by<00:01:38.009> Protoss<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.729> by

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
one three games won by Protoss one by

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.569 
one three games won by Protoss one by
terrence<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.390> i<00:01:39.630> guess<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> Protoss

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
terrence so i guess it is a Protoss

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.130 
terrence so i guess it is a Protoss
favorite<00:01:41.850> map<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.390> matchup<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
favorite map for this matchup but of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
favorite map for this matchup but of
course<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> small<00:01:43.740> sample<00:01:44.130> size<00:01:44.720> in

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
course that's a small sample size in

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.100 
course that's a small sample size in
case<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.820> fire<00:01:48.329> bad<00:01:48.570> hero<00:01:48.810> who

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
case we got a you know fire bad hero who

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.530 
case we got a you know fire bad hero who
is<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.799> good<00:01:50.070> against<00:01:50.850> protoss<00:01:51.180> here

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
is not very good against protoss here

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690

and<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.500> gonna<00:01:52.740> probably<00:01:53.310> play<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and that that's gonna probably play a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.999

it<00:02:22.600> was<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.080> know<00:02:23.110> very<00:02:23.200> interesting<00:02:23.800> to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it was you know very interesting to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.030 
it was you know very interesting to
watch<00:02:24.030> firemen<00:02:25.030> heroes<00:02:25.240> progression<00:02:26.040> he

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
watch firemen heroes progression he

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.560 
watch firemen heroes progression he
certainly<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.640> not<00:02:27.790> as<00:02:27.940> weak<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.210> he<00:02:28.330> used<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
certainly is not as weak as he used to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.290 
certainly is not as weak as he used to
be<00:02:28.690> though<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.610> wouldn't<00:02:30.850> say<00:02:30.910> he's<00:02:31.060> great

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
be though but I wouldn't say he's great

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.290 
be though but I wouldn't say he's great
either<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:32.590> he<00:02:32.830> plays<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.370> best<00:02:33.520> against

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
either I think he plays the best against

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.970 
either I think he plays the best against
protoss<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:34.780> he<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.050> very<00:02:35.140> aggressive<00:02:35.470> in

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
protoss when he is very aggressive in

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.950 
protoss when he is very aggressive in
the<00:02:36.100> early<00:02:36.340> game<00:02:36.520> basically<00:02:37.450> every<00:02:37.630> time<00:02:37.810> he

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
the early game basically every time he

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.680 
the early game basically every time he
won<00:02:38.140> early<00:02:38.440> on<00:02:38.470> was<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.950> fast<00:02:39.400> rush<00:02:39.700> games<00:02:39.970> in

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
won early on was in fast rush games in

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.210 
won early on was in fast rush games in
fact<00:02:40.930> against<00:02:41.410> much<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.770> course<00:02:42.010> there<00:02:42.130> was

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
fact against much of course there was

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.210 
fact against much of course there was
this<00:02:42.310> crazy<00:02:42.810> bunker<00:02:43.810> rush<00:02:44.020> 11<00:02:44.620> much<00:02:44.800> one<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.190> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
this crazy bunker rush 11 much one for a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.770 
this crazy bunker rush 11 much one for a
fast<00:02:45.459> expand<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.940> worked<00:02:46.150> out<00:02:46.270> perfectly

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
fast expand that worked out perfectly

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.449 
fast expand that worked out perfectly
for<00:02:46.870> frybread<00:02:47.230> hero<00:02:47.590> anyway<00:02:48.100> though<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.280> looks

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
for frybread hero anyway though it looks

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.530 
for frybread hero anyway though it looks
like<00:02:48.580> both<00:02:48.760> players<00:02:49.000> going<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.240> start<00:02:49.420> off

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
like both players going to start off

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.890 
like both players going to start off
with<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:49.990> base<00:02:50.200> builds<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:52.510> both<00:02:52.660> going<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
with one base builds I'm both going to

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.530 
with one base builds I'm both going to
go<00:02:52.959> for<00:02:53.470> gas<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.970> we're<00:02:54.970> gonna<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> core

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
go for gas and we're gonna have a core

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.280 
go for gas and we're gonna have a core
and<00:02:55.570> factory<00:02:56.440> opening<00:02:57.010> here<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:58.959> map<00:02:59.140> I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and factory opening here on this map I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.190 
and factory opening here on this map I
think<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.940> actually<00:03:01.090> DTS<00:03:01.780> are<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> viable

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
think I think actually DTS are a viable

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.520 
think I think actually DTS are a viable
option<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.940> course<00:03:04.180> Reavers<00:03:04.570> are<00:03:04.840> possible<00:03:05.320> in

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
option of course Reavers are possible in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.949 
option of course Reavers are possible in
a<00:03:05.620> fast<00:03:05.830> expand<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.430> also<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:07.120> likely<00:03:07.420> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
a fast expand is also very likely I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.500 
a fast expand is also very likely I
think<00:03:08.320> probably<00:03:08.440> fast<00:03:08.830> expand<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.330> most

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
think probably fast expand is the most

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.890 
think probably fast expand is the most
likely<00:03:10.900> tech<00:03:11.709> choice<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.489> pure<00:03:12.900> from

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
likely tech choice here for pure from

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.140 
likely tech choice here for pure from
for<00:03:14.380> fire<00:03:15.190> right<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.430> we'll<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.060> he

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
for fire right here we'll see if he

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.940 
for fire right here we'll see if he
plays<00:03:16.480> aggressively<00:03:17.170> or<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.440> he<00:03:17.500> plays<00:03:17.709> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
conventional fast expanding game I do

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.320 
conventional fast expanding game I do
hope<00:03:20.230> he<00:03:20.380> plays<00:03:20.500> aggressively<00:03:21.070> though<00:03:21.330> pure

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
hope he plays aggressively though pure

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.479 
hope he plays aggressively though pure
is<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> fairly<00:03:23.019> conventional<00:03:23.739> player<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.250> would

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
is a fairly conventional player I would

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.150 
is a fairly conventional player I would
say<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.780> probably<00:03:26.019> would<00:03:26.230> benefit<00:03:26.590> fire

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
say and it probably would benefit fire

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.710 
say and it probably would benefit fire
bet<00:03:27.370> he<00:03:27.459> wrote<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.670> play<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:27.910> his<00:03:28.180> strengths

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
bet he wrote a play for his strengths

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.370 
bet he wrote a play for his strengths
which<00:03:28.959> mainly<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.890> think<00:03:30.190> lie<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:32.260> a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
which mainly I think lie in the just a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.130 
which mainly I think lie in the just a
more<00:03:32.680> aggressive<00:03:32.890> elements<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.610> game<00:03:34.140> so

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
more aggressive elements of the game so

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.840 
more aggressive elements of the game so
you<00:03:35.620> know<00:03:35.739> we'll<00:03:35.920> see<00:03:35.950> we'll<00:03:36.430> see<00:03:36.459> what<00:03:36.730> is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
you know we'll see we'll see what is

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.449 
you know we'll see we'll see what is
strategy<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.660> here<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.530> this<00:03:39.040> game<00:03:39.250> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
strategy is here in this this game I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.759 
strategy is here in this this game I
mean<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.700> think<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.380> certainly<00:03:41.380> important

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
mean I think it's a certainly important

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.120 
mean I think it's a certainly important
for<00:03:41.890> frybread<00:03:42.070> hero<00:03:42.750> he<00:03:43.750> has<00:03:44.110> perhaps<00:03:44.709> lost

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
for frybread hero he has perhaps lost

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.229 
for frybread hero he has perhaps lost
some<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.430> his<00:03:45.580> confidence<00:03:46.060> in<00:03:46.239> recent<00:03:47.019> months

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
some of his confidence in recent months

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.580 
some of his confidence in recent months
he<00:03:49.239> did<00:03:49.390> play<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.600> great<00:03:49.780> game<00:03:49.900> against<00:03:50.290> flash

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
he did play a great game against flash

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.810 
he did play a great game against flash
that<00:03:50.860> he<00:03:50.980> shouldn't<00:03:51.160> feel<00:03:51.310> bad<00:03:51.489> about<00:03:51.580> losing

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
that he shouldn't feel bad about losing

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.590 
that he shouldn't feel bad about losing
by<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> way<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.489> mean<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.820> guess<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.180> wasn't

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
by the way so I mean I guess that wasn't

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.750 
by the way so I mean I guess that wasn't
really<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> confidence<00:03:56.560> downer<00:03:56.890> but<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.430> number

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
really a confidence downer but a number

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.550 
really a confidence downer but a number
of<00:03:57.850> other<00:03:57.970> games<00:03:58.150> he's<00:03:58.390> played<00:03:58.630> has<00:03:58.840> been<00:03:59.080> have

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
of other games he's played has been have

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.050 
of other games he's played has been have
been<00:03:59.590> kind<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.010> confidence<00:04:00.519> Downers<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:00.970> would

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
been kind of confidence Downers I would

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.160 
been kind of confidence Downers I would
say<00:04:01.209> he<00:04:02.049> lost<00:04:02.200> his<00:04:02.410> Savior<00:04:02.950> event<00:04:03.280> recently

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
say he lost his Savior event recently

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.140 
say he lost his Savior event recently

hero win fifty two percent saying pure
will<00:04:10.780> win<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.079> pure<00:04:11.320> even<00:04:11.829> though<00:04:11.920> he<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.250> only

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370

in<00:04:12.579> his<00:04:12.700> forty<00:04:13.120> percent<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.750> think<00:04:14.140> he's<00:04:14.260> only

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
in his forty percent I think he's only

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.780 
in his forty percent I think he's only
forty-three<00:04:14.890> percent<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.340> seeing<00:04:15.610> here

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
against terran even though he is that

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.590 
against terran even though he is that
low<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.729> even<00:04:18.910> though<00:04:19.000> firebird<00:04:19.359> heroes

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
low and even though firebird heroes

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.630 
low and even though firebird heroes
perhaps<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.290> us<00:04:20.470> a<00:04:20.680> more<00:04:20.799> recognizable<00:04:21.430> name

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
perhaps to us a more recognizable name

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.010 
perhaps to us a more recognizable name
it<00:04:21.910> looks<00:04:22.120> like<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> lot<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.479> people<00:04:22.539> think<00:04:22.810> pure

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
it looks like a lot of people think pure

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.810 
it looks like a lot of people think pure
is<00:04:23.140> going<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.320> win<00:04:23.440> anyway<00:04:23.860> maybe<00:04:24.400> because<00:04:24.789> of

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
is going to win anyway maybe because of

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.810 
is going to win anyway maybe because of

fire right heroes recent slump
it<00:04:27.820> looks<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.150> SCV<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.750> going<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.020> get

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it looks like the SCV is going to get

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.890 
it looks like the SCV is going to get
snipe<00:04:30.190> no<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:30.940> actually<00:04:31.240> going<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> get<00:04:31.720> in

and<00:04:32.890> get<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.160> scout<00:04:33.430> out<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:33.820> that's<00:04:33.970> good<00:04:34.440> and

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
and get a scout out so that's good and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.010 
and get a scout out so that's good and
looks<00:04:36.640> like<00:04:36.820> whoa<00:04:37.180> what<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.570> going<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:37.960> there

it's going to go for the FD built with
the<00:04:57.700> fast<00:04:58.000> expand<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:59.250> we're<00:05:00.250> gonna<00:05:00.370> be

the fast expand and we're gonna be

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.140 
the fast expand and we're gonna be

a<00:05:09.490> fast<00:05:09.670> expand<00:05:10.000> afterward<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.890> this<00:05:12.250> is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
a fast expand afterward and this is

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.550 
a fast expand afterward and this is
going<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.580> be<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.670> safe<00:05:12.940> opening<00:05:13.330> for<00:05:13.540> both<00:05:13.690> and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
going to be a safe opening for both and
