one<00:00:56.180> day<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:59.500> love<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.710> direction<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
one day I love the direction of the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.310 
one day I love the direction of the
sport<00:01:01.790> some<00:01:02.210> people<00:01:02.480> don't<00:01:02.629> like<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.840> but<00:01:03.260> I

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
sport some people don't like it but I

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.290 
sport some people don't like it but I
think<00:01:03.379> there<00:01:03.769> are<00:01:03.860> two<00:01:04.010> types<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.400> riders<00:01:04.790> and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
think there are two types of riders and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.149 
think there are two types of riders and
I<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.750> classify<00:01:06.200> myself<00:01:06.380> as<00:01:06.740> more<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.040> a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
I kind of classify myself as more of a

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.310 
I kind of classify myself as more of a
jumper<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.270> love<00:01:08.630> going<00:01:08.900> out<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.200> riding

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
jumper and I love going out and riding

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.490 
jumper and I love going out and riding
that<00:01:09.590> technical<00:01:10.190> stuff<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.790> having<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.930> get

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
that technical stuff and having to get

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.800 
that technical stuff and having to get
used<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> track<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.340> have<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.880> be<00:01:14.030> where

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
used to the track and have it be where

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.270 
used to the track and have it be where
it<00:01:14.930> will<00:01:15.020> push<00:01:15.260> me<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.770> make<00:01:15.890> me<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.130> better

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
it will push me and make me a better

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.030 
it will push me and make me a better
driver<00:01:20.140> concentration<00:01:21.140> is<00:01:21.260> key<00:01:21.530> if<00:01:21.770> you're

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
driver concentration is key if you're

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.620 
driver concentration is key if you're
not<00:01:22.190> focused<00:01:22.400> you're<00:01:22.820> gonna<00:01:22.970> get<00:01:23.119> beat<00:01:23.330> right

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
not focused you're gonna get beat right

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.680 
not focused you're gonna get beat right
out<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.960> gate<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.440> need<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.159> 100%

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
out of the gate you need to have 100%

out of the gate you need to have 100%
concentration<00:01:26.690> all<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.200> time

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
concentration all of the time

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.670 
concentration all of the time
I<00:01:29.479> think<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.659> sets<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:31.020> apart<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
I think what sets me apart from the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
I think what sets me apart from the
competition<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.330> feel<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.960> have

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
competition is that I feel like I have

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.570 
competition is that I feel like I have
more<00:01:34.229> ambition<00:01:34.740> than<00:01:34.770> everyone<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
more ambition than everyone to be in

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.429 
more ambition than everyone to be in
