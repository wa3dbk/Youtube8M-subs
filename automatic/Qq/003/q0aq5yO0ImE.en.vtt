00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
completing a level fairly quickly while

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:10.850 
completing a level fairly quickly while
you<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.710> it

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
you do it

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740 
you do it
I<00:00:11.010> move<00:00:11.820> through<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> level<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> quick<00:00:12.719> pace

so<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> be<00:00:14.130> difficult<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.580> me<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so it's going to be difficult for me to

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630 
so it's going to be difficult for me to
explain<00:00:15.570> each<00:00:15.870> section<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:17.010> great<00:00:17.340> amount

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.570 
haven't done it but that's my guide to
getting<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.390> three<00:01:57.600> star<00:01:57.810> coins<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.620> level<00:01:59.100> 97

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
getting all three star coins in level 97

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760 
getting all three star coins in level 97
and<00:01:59.730> completing<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.780> level<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.470> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and completing the level in about I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
and completing the level in about I
think<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.970> minutes<00:02:03.150> or<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.810> probably<00:02:04.170> less

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
think two minutes or so or probably less

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.070 
think two minutes or so or probably less
than<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.570> hope<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.720> enjoyed<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
than that I hope you enjoyed and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.760 
than that I hope you enjoyed and
something<00:02:07.830> else<00:02:07.979> farewell
