00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.280 
is to get that game going against Tampa
very<00:01:51.490> critical<00:01:51.970> for<00:01:52.570> two<00:01:52.750> reasons<00:01:52.930> one

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
very critical for two reasons one

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.200 
very critical for two reasons one
because<00:01:53.470> they're<00:01:53.800> great<00:01:54.340> rushdie<00:01:54.820> there<00:01:55.150> are

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
because they're great rushdie there are

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.859 
because they're great rushdie there are
great<00:01:55.420> pass<00:01:55.690> rush<00:01:56.020> defense<00:01:56.850> number<00:01:57.850> 25<00:01:58.420> 27

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
great pass rush defense number 25 27

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.200 
great pass rush defense number 25 27
sacks<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.530> then<00:02:00.130> number<00:02:00.550> two<00:02:00.670> because<00:02:00.970> their

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
sacks and then number two because their

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.460 
sacks and then number two because their
quarterbacks<00:02:01.600> breaks<00:02:01.810> we<00:02:02.020> gotta<00:02:02.200> find<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.440> way

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
quarterbacks breaks we gotta find a way

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.710 
quarterbacks breaks we gotta find a way
to<00:02:02.590> run<00:02:02.890> along<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.340> come<00:02:03.430> off<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> field<00:02:03.970> so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to run along to come off the field so

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.570 
to run along to come off the field so
it'll<00:02:05.320> be<00:02:05.350> very<00:02:05.590> critical<00:02:05.830> part<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.369> game

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
it'll be very critical part of this game

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.810 
it'll be very critical part of this game
wait<00:02:07.570> how<00:02:07.720> much<00:02:07.900> stress<00:02:08.289> has<00:02:08.560> put<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
Stanford put on on the safeties

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.130 
Stanford put on on the safeties
particular<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> saffron<00:02:13.360> Satan<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:13.959> the

particular the saffron Satan with the
play<00:02:14.680> action<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.450> tight<00:02:16.450> end<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.930> think

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
play action and the tight end I think

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.220 
play action and the tight end I think
you<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.010> think<00:02:18.510> what's<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.600> unique<00:02:19.870> while

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
you I think what's really unique while

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.540 
you I think what's really unique while
they<00:02:20.320> do<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.560> they<00:02:20.680> put<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.160> pressure<00:02:21.430> on

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
they do is they put a lot of pressure on

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.810 
they do is they put a lot of pressure on
all<00:02:21.790> four<00:02:22.090> TVs<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.320> run<00:02:23.500> game<00:02:23.670> usually<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
all four TVs in the run game usually you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.280 
all four TVs in the run game usually you
got<00:02:24.970> wide<00:02:25.270> receivers<00:02:25.630> outside<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> system

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
got wide receivers outside the system

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.690 
got wide receivers outside the system
that<00:02:26.560> goes<00:02:26.650> goal<00:02:26.980> line<00:02:27.130> sometimes<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
that goes goal line sometimes in the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.610 
that goes goal line sometimes in the
middle<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> field<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.959> your<00:02:29.230> corners

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
middle of the field so all your corners

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.020 
middle of the field so all your corners
and<00:02:29.709> safeties<00:02:29.860> have<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> work<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> fits

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and safeties have to work on the fits

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.190 
and safeties have to work on the fits
and<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.239> able<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.390> tackle<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> line<00:02:32.050> of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and be able to tackle the line of

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.020 
and be able to tackle the line of
scrimmage<00:02:32.260> or<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.739> which<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.040> unusual<00:02:33.280> it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
scrimmage or so which is unusual it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.850 
scrimmage or so which is unusual it's
like<00:02:34.120> playing<00:02:34.330> goal<00:02:34.570> line<00:02:34.720> defense<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.260> then

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
like playing goal line defense and then

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.650 
like playing goal line defense and then
the<00:02:36.160> difference<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.640> down<00:02:36.820> there<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.540> don't

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
the difference is down there you don't

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.729 
the difference is down there you don't
worry<00:02:37.810> much<00:02:37.930> about<00:02:38.019> play<00:02:38.320> action<00:02:38.500> out<00:02:38.709> here

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
worry much about play action out here

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.380 
worry much about play action out here
yet<00:02:39.040> we're<00:02:39.220> about<00:02:39.310> play<00:02:39.550> action<00:02:39.730> because<00:02:40.150> they

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
yet we're about play action because they

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
yet we're about play action because they
have<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.540> whole<00:02:40.720> length<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.080> field<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.620> it's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
have the whole length of field so it's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.720 
have the whole length of field so it's
very<00:02:42.550> unique<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:43.209> know

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
very unique you know

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.979 
very unique you know
prepare<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.030> they<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.420> great<00:02:44.629> job<00:02:44.750> of
