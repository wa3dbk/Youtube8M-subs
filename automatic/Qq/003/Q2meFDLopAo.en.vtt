00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
of figuring it out and I couldn't find a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.790 
of figuring it out and I couldn't find a
tutorial<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> real

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.540 
tutorial for it so you know the real
name<00:00:16.830> let<00:00:17.580> me<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:18.859> just<00:00:19.859> learned<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
name let me know just learned it from a

bit rusty air with me but i can tell you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
bit rusty air with me but i can tell you
enough<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.390> let<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.080> too<00:00:25.340> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
enough to let you can do it too all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.600 
enough to let you can do it too all
right<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.269> looks<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:31.369> work<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.489> my

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
right this is what looks like work on my

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.390 
right this is what looks like work on my
hand

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
hand

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.810 
hand
alright

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
alright

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.720 
alright
so<00:00:37.360> this<00:00:37.570> trick<00:00:37.810> is<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:38.079> about<00:00:38.290> timing<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
so this trick is all about timing it's

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.370 
so this trick is all about timing it's
going<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.000> easier<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.480> use<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.810> bigger<00:00:41.110> group

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
going to be easier to use a bigger group

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.580 
going to be easier to use a bigger group
so<00:00:42.100> you'll<00:00:42.250> have<00:00:42.400> more<00:00:42.640> space<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:44.290> is<00:00:44.440> when

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
so you'll have more space this is when

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.020 
so you'll have more space this is when
you're<00:00:45.010> going<00:00:45.129> to<00:00:45.220> be<00:00:45.280> able<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.520> step<00:00:45.730> there<00:00:45.940> is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
you're going to be able to step there is

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.680 
you're going to be able to step there is
when<00:00:46.210> it's<00:00:46.330> right<00:00:48.329> obviously<00:00:49.620> ok<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
when it's right obviously ok so it's

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.450 
when it's right obviously ok so it's
keeping<00:00:53.260> your<00:00:53.410> closet<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.040> smaller<00:00:54.309> group

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
keeping your closet with a smaller group

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.009 
keeping your closet with a smaller group
it's<00:00:54.790> just<00:00:54.960> easier<00:00:55.960> with<00:00:56.080> a<00:00:56.140> big<00:00:56.320> one<00:00:56.559> okay<00:00:57.550> so

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
it's just easier with a big one okay so

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's just easier with a big one okay so
do<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.370> you're<00:01:00.460> who<00:01:00.610> gets<00:01:00.850> about<00:01:01.120> right

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
do it and you're who gets about right

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.490 
do it and you're who gets about right
here's<00:01:03.070> where<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.699> start<00:01:04.210> usually<00:01:04.750> looking

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
here's where I start usually looking

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.460 
here's where I start usually looking
that<00:01:06.460> way<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:07.240> actually<00:01:07.479> sets<00:01:07.990> better<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.410> will

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
that way I actually sets better it will

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.270 
that way I actually sets better it will
be<00:01:08.530> right<00:01:08.800> nice<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.789> centered<00:01:10.440> same<00:01:11.440> time<00:01:11.950> as

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
be right nice and centered same time as

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.180 
be right nice and centered same time as
you<00:01:12.490> look<00:01:12.759> your<00:01:12.940> leg<00:01:13.149> up<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.680> step<00:01:14.740> through

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
you look your leg up and step through

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.620 
you look your leg up and step through
once<00:01:15.399> it<00:01:15.490> gets<00:01:15.670> here<00:01:15.910> you're<00:01:16.090> going<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.330> grab

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
once it gets here you're going to grab

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.200 
once it gets here you're going to grab
it<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:18.070> grooving<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> left<00:01:18.850> you're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
it you're grooving to the left you're

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.760 
it you're grooving to the left you're
going<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.390> step<00:01:19.660> and<00:01:19.960> grab<00:01:20.229> with<00:01:20.410> your<00:01:20.440> left

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
right time it's the biggest thing I

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.429 
right time it's the biggest thing I
can't<00:01:47.110> iterate<00:01:47.590> reiterate<00:01:48.220> how<00:01:48.460> much<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
can't iterate reiterate how much the

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.840 
can't iterate reiterate how much the
time<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.830> how<00:01:50.950> important<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.400> time<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.729> gets

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
time of how important the time it gets

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.020 
time of how important the time it gets
to<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.119> scene<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.610> centered<00:01:54.909> around
