 forgive that the video looks bad 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.670
 but it's the same 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.800
 as you see here I finished the game with 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.250
 some players that's why everything is in 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.250
 yellow 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.920
 the bits will unlock when 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.629
 they play career mode the same 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.629
 maps that are also good 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.300
 to do the tricks we need very 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.660
 good speed and good fingers to make 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.660
 the tricks 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.140
 can go here to see who tricks 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.140

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
 you will wonder how do I make 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.580
 for the tricks turn red 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.910
 this is very easy we are going to do for 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.740
 example a superman does not hunger first 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.450
 let's make a superman but they have 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.120
 that take a lot of career so that the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.100
 superman be good when we are 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.260
 doing the superman do not stop squeezing 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.080
 the w that is the button which we will do the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.270
 tricks once the button is pressed we are going to 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.200
 press the s button to make the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.750
 know under 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.510
 it takes a lot of practice and it will come out 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.310
 rather than mine the same can 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.420
