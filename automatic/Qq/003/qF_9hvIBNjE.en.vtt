00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.050 
these the mechanism um tutorials and I
pop<00:03:30.909> that<00:03:30.939> mechanism<00:03:31.810> into<00:03:32.439> five<00:03:33.189> big<00:03:33.610> pieces

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
pop that mechanism into five big pieces

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.119 
pop that mechanism into five big pieces
will<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.450> easier<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.200> understand<00:03:35.860> so

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
will be easier for you to understand so

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.309 
will be easier for you to understand so
this<00:03:36.939> is<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.120> first<00:03:37.360> piece<00:03:37.629> is<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:37.900> like

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
this is the first piece is just like

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:49.220 
this is the first piece is just like
that<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.560> I'm<00:03:41.680> going<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.890> talk<00:03:42.099> for<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.430> while

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:58.110 

and<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.040> second<00:03:51.640> piece<00:03:55.349> Joey<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and this is the second piece Joey is the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:10.789 
and this is the second piece Joey is the
third<00:03:58.329> piece

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.910 

and<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.430> 40

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.210 

be<00:04:18.490> sure<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.930> pause<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.140> video<00:04:22.770> if<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.950> fifth

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
be sure to pause the video if the fifth

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.460 
be sure to pause the video if the fifth
taste<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.880> hottest<00:04:25.090> one<00:04:26.190> yeah<00:04:28.470> surely

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
taste is the hottest one yeah surely

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.820 
taste is the hottest one yeah surely
still<00:04:29.740> smooth<00:04:30.520> piece<00:04:31.410> through<00:04:32.410> one<00:04:32.590> times

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
still smooth piece through one times

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.830 
still smooth piece through one times
three<00:04:33.100> which<00:04:33.340> is<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.760> right<00:04:33.970> here<00:04:35.700> yeah<00:04:36.840> this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
three which is that right here yeah this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.660 
three which is that right here yeah this
is<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.140> that<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.410> for<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.740> bottom<00:04:39.160> just<00:04:39.460> 1

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
is the one that is for the bottom just 1

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.350 
is the one that is for the bottom just 1
times<00:04:39.910> 4<00:04:40.240> 1<00:04:41.020> times<00:04:41.200> 1<00:04:41.470> 1<00:04:41.620> times<00:04:41.860> 8<00:04:42.190> 1<00:04:42.520> times<00:04:42.760> 6<00:04:43.090> 1

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
times 4 1 times 1 1 times 8 1 times 6 1

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.260 
times 4 1 times 1 1 times 8 1 times 6 1
times<00:04:43.570> 1<00:04:43.870> 1<00:04:44.050> times<00:04:44.260> 2<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.160> then<00:04:45.190> 3<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.820> 1<00:04:46.150> that

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
times 1 1 times 2 and then 3 and 1 that

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.070 
times 1 1 times 2 and then 3 and 1 that
is<00:04:46.420> 2<00:04:47.880> which<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.090> free<00:04:49.390> easy<00:04:51.480> ok<00:04:52.510> not<00:04:52.810> an

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
is 2 which is free easy ok not an

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.470 
is 2 which is free easy ok not an
artifice<00:04:53.680> keepers<00:04:54.220> then<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.730> take<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.240> and

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
artifice keepers then you take this and

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.480 
artifice keepers then you take this and
this<00:04:56.130> put<00:04:57.130> them<00:04:57.280> together<00:04:57.520> like<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:57.970> and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
this put them together like that and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.730 
this put them together like that and
then<00:05:00.490> we<00:05:00.970> take<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.750> piece<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:03.180> then<00:05:04.180> you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
then we take this piece and then you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.390 
then we take this piece and then you
make<00:05:05.740> sure<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.160> 22<00:05:07.060> rate<00:05:07.270> water<00:05:07.600> right<00:05:08.110> here

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
make sure this 22 rate water right here

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.420 
make sure this 22 rate water right here
this<00:05:09.400> thing<00:05:09.730> together<00:05:10.720> right<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.840> then<00:05:14.430> you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
this thing together right and then you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.900 
this thing together right and then you
have<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.730> take<00:05:15.910> this<00:05:16.090> very<00:05:16.870> right<00:05:17.020> here<00:05:17.910> and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
have to take this very right here and

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.140 
have to take this very right here and
then<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.180> have<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.450> take<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:21.040> then<00:05:21.880> put

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
then you have to take this and then put

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.400 
then you have to take this and then put
it<00:05:22.240> right<00:05:22.450> here<00:05:26.400> maybe<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.410> you

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
it right here maybe like that and you

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.510 
it right here maybe like that and you
found<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:29.890> down<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.310> mechanism<00:05:30.850> piece<00:05:32.520> and

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
found it down the mechanism piece and

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.100 
found it down the mechanism piece and
look<00:05:33.760> at<00:05:34.000> this<00:05:34.090> thing

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
look at this thing

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:50.559 
look at this thing
then<00:05:35.980> you<00:05:36.190> just<00:05:36.370> put<00:05:36.880> this<00:05:38.190> here<00:05:46.680> yeah<00:05:47.680> okay

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.029 

these<00:05:51.379> were<00:05:51.649> short<00:05:51.919> video<00:05:52.279> for<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:53.020> little

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
these were short video for the little

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.019 
these were short video for the little
candy<00:05:55.039> machine<00:05:55.399> tomorrow<00:05:55.819> is<00:05:56.479> just<00:05:56.960> like<00:05:57.199> that

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
candy machine tomorrow is just like that

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.679 
candy machine tomorrow is just like that
just<00:05:59.229> make<00:06:00.229> this<00:06:00.409> thing<00:06:01.149> you<00:06:02.149> should<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.389> friend

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
just make this thing you should a friend

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:20.140 
just make this thing you should a friend
move<00:06:06.580> back<00:06:07.580> new

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.850

and then I must put this let me take a
one<00:06:42.900> time<00:06:43.110> Swanson<00:06:43.740> piece<00:06:44.100> and<00:06:44.910> put<00:06:45.120> it<00:06:45.150> right

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
one time Swanson piece and put it right

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:55.820 
one time Swanson piece and put it right
here<00:06:45.390> okay

like that here and you also need is some
time<00:07:37.650> to<00:07:37.860> foster<00:07:38.580> peace<00:07:38.610> for<00:07:39.240> the<00:07:39.330> key<00:07:39.600> it's

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 
time to foster peace for the key it's

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.110 
time to foster peace for the key it's
pretty<00:07:40.740> thing<00:07:41.300> then<00:07:42.300> you<00:07:42.570> just<00:07:42.810> test<00:07:43.169> it<00:07:44.120> it

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
pretty thing then you just test it it

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.650 
pretty thing then you just test it it
works<00:07:45.410> and<00:07:47.300> yeah<00:07:48.530> so<00:07:49.530> is<00:07:50.460> the<00:07:50.700> candy<00:07:51.300> machines

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 
works and yeah so is the candy machines

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.090 
works and yeah so is the candy machines
and<00:07:52.190> have<00:07:53.190> fun<00:07:53.400> right
