00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.460 
exactly like my friend's gun stock there
is<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.470> much<00:02:43.680> time<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:45.150> time<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:46.080> goes

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
is so much time and well time that goes

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.100 
is so much time and well time that goes
into<00:02:46.770> achieving<00:02:47.100> some<00:02:47.550> type<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> digital
