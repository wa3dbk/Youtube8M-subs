 the percentage of fat I will have to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.840
 make a more regulated diet without many 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.780
 carbohydrates prioritizing carbohydrates 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.690
 low glycemic index a form 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.690
 general has an equal incidence with any 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.900
 other non-English brand carbohydrate 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.470

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.320
 the doctor then what happens inside 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.850
 you and your plan is full of Junk

 Blood is transformed as 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.910
 react when it is full of record 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.250
 does not release in a row 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.720
 Insulin is a hormone that contributes 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 for the accumulation of fat 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.560
 we are trying to reduce the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.900
 percentage of fat with increase of 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 muscle mass so he spoke 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.660
 for you to use whole carbohydrates 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 understood and integrals we absorb 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.730
 slowly 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.260
 he has memory difference the rice 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.840
 whole white rice 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 it has a lot of fiber to fiber inside the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 It will make a network that still 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.129
 from swimming with Andrade and 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.430
 consequently does not release the 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.010
 command that does on one side of the then 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.069
 this week there always a balance 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.489
 with protein fiber and carbohydrates 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.049
 low glycemic index and with that 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.620
 encourage the loss of 5 percent 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.200
 fat in 40 days 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.239
 always maintaining the lean mass then 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.079
 initially that we have to have a 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.230
 weight to their body mass index 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:10.010
 the weight divided by the height of 1 30.25 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.680
 that means he's early in the band 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.919
 of obesity braun and here is the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.870
 percentage of fat I turn 5.4 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.690
 it is also in the range of obesity 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.570
 doing we have to reduce both 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.340
 the percentage of fat 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.250
 so he voted me in the middle as 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.259
 objective that reduces the percentage of 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.180
 fat and muscle hypertrophy 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:37.460
 This worsening day worked the whole day. 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.560
 trained arrives dead at home can send 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.060
 that rested like a halt 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.550
 here you have to eat your own omelet 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.830
 clear and a chicken 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.690
 You just can not eat anything better, right? 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.909
 To give that laid back 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.229
 at this time that the day with the most 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:02.479
 do what 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:03.860
 Come on in with some oil that's over 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.009

 I started the super quiet diet without hunger 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.830
 It's 100 for now with no will. 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.289
 to eat out of capoeira da 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.919
 diet are six meals a day so 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.560
 no one is at risk of those than the polished 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.380
 always associated assets and we will continue 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.750
 Focus on this fucking monster 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.830
 then you can also do the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.040
 side dish 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.190

 and you will not see results 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.330
 when the person discovers that it is better 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.360
