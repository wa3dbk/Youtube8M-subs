these nerve endings are what provide

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.510 
these nerve endings are what provide

you'll be able to feel how to connect

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.450 
you'll be able to feel how to connect
with<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.440> water<00:05:02.650> on<00:05:02.800> your<00:05:02.949> in<00:05:03.070> sweep<00:05:03.280> and
