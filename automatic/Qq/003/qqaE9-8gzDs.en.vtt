 make an animation movie but as 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.060
 everything in life and not only in this 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.489

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.780
 opportunity and then just arrived 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.770

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.110
 proper character and here I am sir

 who recruits a group to save the world 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 I looked at camera unit I knew of 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.590
 operate 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.570
 in which doubles to phoebe the character of 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 friends in spain 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.409
 then he already had his characters and I did not 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 I know if the character will remind you a little 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.340
 that did that what you did with the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.910
 voice of civilian that the tones that of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.550
 suddenly grandma rites more seriously than 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.990
 my voice lasted a lot and it came to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.660
 falsettos that I did not know I could 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.550
 arrive the two agree that the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.400
 work of benders especially 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.790
 lonely 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.250
 he's very lonely and I compensated him with 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.860
 my portfolio and I take my portfolio 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.360
 clear house I covered myself I have very macaroni 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.820
 and guides that I do not know what to give two take it to 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.180
 have a contact there with my things 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.460
 villeta is not a little cold not to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 principle when they are not used 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 cold because you are alone the image that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.860
 in the highest percentage of all 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.230
 occasions that I have folded are not in 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.750
 good conditions about being white and 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.250
 black the character even drawn very 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.360
 wrong because there are problems with the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.490
 rights do not want to be leaked 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 images and such and it's very complicated to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 speak it but with the help of the director 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.890
 in this case like jose luÃ­s angle 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.790
 you can nail your interpretations of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.740
 do everything right 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.510
 good night avoid the slogan of the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.580
 movie says that when the world 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.190
 you need a hero in the best solution 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.560
 is a villain then one wonders 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.190
 what is the villain that we need in 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.860
 Spain 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.660
 we need heroes more sevillian and if 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 they are villains made heroes first there are 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.350
 than give them a couple of wafers and then the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.310
 we let ourselves be heroes I know who it is for 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.310
 boy 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.620
 that you say calvarota dead if sometimes you 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 I look at her and imagine a chick 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.580
 coming out 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.650
 and the message that the movie has a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.050
 little I think that's what I've done 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.000
 before people although we can not 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.830
 change we can improve what he said 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.560
 this now of the villains that exist 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 today we are not going to say names 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.950
 but we are all thinking of my 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.890
 possible to I can not improve we should 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.140
 improve and barcenas person can change 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.620
 euros for dollars but improve the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.340
 photocopies 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.340
