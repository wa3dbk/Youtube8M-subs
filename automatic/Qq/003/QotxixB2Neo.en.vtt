00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 wow that this new video in which they 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.960
 I bring the best room for the samsung 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.330
 galaxy s 4 and 9,500 is how it is 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.950
 completely based on cyanogenmod 12.1 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.849
 and also completely based on 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.370
 android 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.350
 pure in android stock do not remember that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 being a is only compatible with the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.359
 samsung galaxy 4 and 9500 not with any 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 another model more so well then I 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 I'll leave the link in the in the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 description so that it goes xd after 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 bloopers to download all the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.330
 network completely the latest version already 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 that are coming out new versions fall 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 every week they are improving much more 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.210
 every day not and before I started I wanted to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 say that this review is based 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 completely in my experiences that I've 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.149
 had during two days of intensive use 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 with this course and the truth my 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.140
 impressions have been totally good 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 since it 's a totally fluid route 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.539
 gives a new life to the phone since with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.280
 official lollipop and the truth is me the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.469
 takes a lot of applications delayed 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.879
 long to get into and out truth 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.859
 be a month managed to give a new 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.670
 device life so good 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670
 we start 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.750
 we started by saying that I have the nova 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.850
 comes installed by default 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.710
 cyanogenmod launcher that I do not like 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 I do not like at all so can 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.189
 install the google now launcher bell that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810
 you want and well I will start 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.210
 talking about the interface and how we can 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 see we have everything fully traced 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.450
 of lollipop is not like in other rooms 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.070
 that you change some colors here 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.439
 that is a bit transparent that I do not know 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.990
 what that looks downright horrible does not 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.530
 they change the source or anything like that and here 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.149
 we can in the notifications 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.640
 keep pressed and all that we can 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.799
 to silence them we can do everything 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.659
 fully traced and added some 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.670
 functions of cyanogenmod let's go 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.530
 of the lock screen and for those who 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.049
 wonder these tubes I have them 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.270
 achieved with a gravity box since 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.280
 This is fully compatible with 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 expel from you of sale the truths 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 of the recovery if I have tutorial of how 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.679
 do it on my channel and well let's 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.149
 open some applications now for 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.649
 that you see performance as it is 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.920
 totally fluid as soon as we touch the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 application either 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 of aller as you see in the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 calls are heard frankly fine if 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.120
 is that you do not hear calls can 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560
 be by the modem that they have to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.959
 update to the latest update 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.790
 of lollipop have to update the 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.920
 modem so that you hear it totally 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.020
 well if it is not heard well 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.959
 obviously not here we can see the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.390
 messenger the messages that would be that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.230
 speak totally well let's go to the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
 Walkman music and as you can see it is brief 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.040
 very fast we are going to listen to the sound 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.319
 so you can get an idea of how 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.590
 the truth sounds loud enough 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.140
 not quite high as the tree would be um 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.620
 stop but it sounds good loud 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.620
 good is true 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.450
 and who does not 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.430
 the truth is well equalized the sound 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.070
 everything works correctly I have tried 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.540
 the calls void karts that are called 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.280
 that would be the calls by messenger 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.470
 by whatsapp and everything is working 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.140
 correctly since that book was before 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.670
 although I could not could not fix it but 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.220
 it is already fully functioning 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.380
 wrong another of the bucs was that it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.960
 I trained the battery now I did not have 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.060
 these drainage problems and the problem 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 larger than previously and by 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 which did not encourage me to show them 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.610
 you are magnified it was that the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.700
 sound was going you were there for 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.020
 example listening to music or something and the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.330
 nothing served the sound and they had to 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.190
 restart to return or they had to 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.080
 make a call to return the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.110
 sound now totally is already 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.360
 arranged that bus and good something is missing 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.460
 some bugs that are not yet achieved 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.470
 fix in any room based on the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.630
 usp as would be transmit screen 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.460
 because when transmitting the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.830
 screen the inverted colors appear 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.380
 and when recording screen too 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.660
 the inverted colors are reproduced 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.490
 me to show them on the channel 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.560
 recording the screen I have to 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.280
 convert it to other colors using 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.990
 is 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.670
 call android version beat pro 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.640
 sorry it would be the application called 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.350
 android beat pro that would serve to give 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.600
 the return to the colors to render 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.940
 the completely normal colors by 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.760
 that I show you some things in the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.320
 channel recorded with this room that the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.480
 You have seen that it runs a lot 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.620
 fluid and good and I 'm running out 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.000
 air now let's go to the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.130
 configuration for you to see 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.700
 all the sections that we have here 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.810
 we can see gestures here these gestures do not 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.760
 they understand very well but the environment 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.160
 display works correctly hands 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.310
 wave I do not understand very well and because 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.110
 neither what that means on the buttons 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.790
 of you can change every action 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.890
 for example, since with the menu 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.540
 open the multitasking and as you see the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.700
 multitasking is totally fluid no 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.919
 they have nothing long as they see in the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.950
 battery we can see all the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.840
 things that we have been using for 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.780
 Example status in 23 minutes of screen 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.520
 and I have 92 percent battery something 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.810
 that the truth is quite good you 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.690
 can install the eject 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.690
 and activate the gravity boxer and the green and 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.490
 fight for the he amplified forgiveness and the 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.200
 green ifai so they can save something 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.150
 more than battery in more here we can 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.800
 put this cleaning button that would be 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.600
 here that I have been asked many how 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.460
 I put this cleaning button and here in 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.470
 more we can hide in the bar 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.730
 search or whatever you want to me 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.740
 I do not like the search bar the 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.919
 multitasking because you remove space then 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.720
 I've removed it, we're not going to go 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.110
 of the device and the Android version 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.760
 what we are running is android 5.1 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.889
 as you can see and I also wanted 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.990
 tell them that they pass applications to the 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.150
 sd card is fully functional 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.440
 also the tubes here we can 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.300
 modify all of them from the 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.860
 configuration the lantern is 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.840
 working properly on everything 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.030
 sense 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.680
 the camera now we go to the camera something 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.780
 who are also asking so many 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.280
 and well, the camera is also 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.280
 working very well let's see it 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.490
 and focused a little too fast here 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.920
 we can see if it appeared taken these 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.200
 photos recently and the truth is that 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.820
 they do it too well you guys 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.670
 can you download the camera that you 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.140
 want for example I use the camera 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.740
 of feve 5 that gives me some very good 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.290
 colors similar to that of Guiza's camera 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.670
 start all not when we are going to run 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.700
 some of applications for you 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.880
 see the fluency finally 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.670
 how do you see this pretty cool fluency in 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.680
 this rumba the installation is too much 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.360
 always mind if you do not know 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.850
 how to install a student speak the 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.070
 instructions in the post of x may be 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.460
 to be guided in how I installed the room 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.990
 deliciano jomo 12.1 that will be here below 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.090
 in the description can be guided from there 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.860
 because it is practically the same to the 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.630
 time to install and then they can 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.490
 guide yourself from there not since the truth is 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.430
 very easy just hope that it will start 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.800
 It takes about five minutes to start 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.050
 for the first time so do not worry 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.880
 for all that and good to end up being 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.370
 I also wanted to tell you that this 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.410
 this sensor here I do not know what it's called 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.180
 of it to change channels 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.770
 television is also on 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.590
 you can completely download 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.460
 that of google play that would be watson and what 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.230
 they set up and it 's also completely 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.550
 satisfactory functioning correctly 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.620
 at the time of opening games is also 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.030
 totally fluid is room and good 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.950
 it seems that I do not have anything more than 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.320
 say because then my impressions have 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.040
 been totally good and still the only 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.400
 thing they need to fix that would be 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.290
 sometimes sometimes it would start so 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.660
 less once the 10 mayren started to 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.670
 me for example I have been listening 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.950
 music and out of nowhere it restarts just the 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.650
 cellular but I think in the next 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.450
 versions you have to have a lot of patience 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.210
 since then in the next version so 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.590
 maybe they will correct you in their books and 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.290
 let's have a completely version 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.090
 usable and well this version also 

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.560
 It is completely usable for the day to 

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.270
 day so I hope you like the 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.830
 video and if so, do not forget 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.540
 leave your good like it costs nothing and 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.970
 it helps a lot if they like this 

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.650

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.120
