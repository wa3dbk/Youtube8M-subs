00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to the lungs in the middle region here

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.899 
to the lungs in the middle region here
there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> shed<00:01:21.090> area<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.549> there<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.640> two

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
there's a shed area and there are two

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.179 
there's a shed area and there are two
very<00:01:24.479> important<00:01:25.110> threats<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.799> area

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
very important threats in this area

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
very important threats in this area
called<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.420> soft<00:01:27.720> palate<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
called the soft palate and the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
called the soft palate and the
epiglottis<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> flats<00:01:33.090> act<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.020> doors

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
epiglottis the flats act just like doors

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.300 
epiglottis the flats act just like doors
opening<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> closing<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.329> channels<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
opening and closing the channels so that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
opening and closing the channels so that
the<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.490> things<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> right<00:01:39.689> tubes

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the right things go to the right tubes

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
the right things go to the right tubes
such<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.950> air<00:01:41.720> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> lungs<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
such as air going to the lungs but not

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.560 
such as air going to the lungs but not
food<00:01:50.060> Apple<00:01:51.229> no

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960 

this<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.620> what<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.980> looks<00:01:56.220> like<00:01:56.370> in<00:01:56.790> most

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
this is what it looks like in most

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is what it looks like in most
species<00:01:57.330> such<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.170> dog<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.950> cat<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.700> even

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
species such as the dog the cat and even

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.610 
species such as the dog the cat and even
us<00:02:00.170> when<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.290> eat<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.310> Apple<00:02:03.320> goes<00:02:04.320> into

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
us when we eat like this Apple goes into

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.340 
us when we eat like this Apple goes into
the<00:02:04.710> mouth<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.370> chew<00:02:05.400> chew<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.870> our<00:02:06.990> soft

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the mouth to chew chew and our soft

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.180 
the mouth to chew chew and our soft
palate<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.100> raised<00:02:08.580> up<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.500> our<00:02:10.500> epiglottis

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
palate is raised up and our epiglottis

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.020 
palate is raised up and our epiglottis
is<00:02:11.459> lower<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> Apple<00:02:14.370> can

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
is lower down so then the Apple can

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
is lower down so then the Apple can
travel<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> stock<00:02:16.700> when<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.820> breathe

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
travel to the stock when we breathe

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
travel to the stock when we breathe
through<00:02:18.540> our<00:02:18.570> nose<00:02:19.820> air<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:22.650> breathe<00:02:23.010> through

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
through our nose air we breathe through

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
through our nose air we breathe through
the<00:02:23.370> nose<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.600> soft<00:02:24.930> palate<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.590> lowered<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the nose the soft palate is lowered and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.490 
the nose the soft palate is lowered and
epiglottis<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.830> raised<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.630> air<00:02:30.840> can

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
epiglottis is raised so that the air can

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.160 
epiglottis is raised so that the air can
travel<00:02:31.830> down<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.640> lumps<00:02:33.120> when<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
travel down to the lumps when you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.090 
travel down to the lumps when you
breathe<00:02:34.380> through<00:02:34.739> our<00:02:34.770> mouths<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.770> soft

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
breathe through our mouths the soft

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.050 
breathe through our mouths the soft
palate<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.760> raised<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> act<00:02:41.670> lots<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
palate is raised and the act lots of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
palate is raised and the act lots of
space<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> air<00:02:43.350> can<00:02:43.890> go<00:02:44.010> down<00:02:44.220> into

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
space so then the air can go down into

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.160 
space so then the air can go down into
the<00:02:44.820> lungs<00:02:47.000> however<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.570> pretty<00:02:48.900> different

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
the lungs however it's pretty different

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
the lungs however it's pretty different
in<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> horse<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.680> soft<00:02:52.980> palate<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.760> horse<00:02:54.030> is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
in a horse the soft palate of a horse is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.840 
in a horse the soft palate of a horse is
much<00:02:54.720> longer<00:02:55.200> than<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> usual<00:02:55.650> soft<00:02:56.489> palate

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
much longer than the usual soft palate

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.930 
much longer than the usual soft palate
and<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.090> other<00:02:57.269> species<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> let's<00:02:59.700> put<00:02:59.910> our

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and all other species so let's put our

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.370 
and all other species so let's put our
soft<00:03:00.269> palate<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:01.340> when<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> horse<00:03:02.700> breathe

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
soft palate here when the horse breathe

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.949 
soft palate here when the horse breathe
through<00:03:04.380> its<00:03:04.530> nose<00:03:04.799> as<00:03:05.670> usual<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.420> goes<00:03:06.630> down

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
through its nose as usual it goes down

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.680 
through its nose as usual it goes down
to<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> levels<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
to the levels but as you can see the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.650 
to the levels but as you can see the
epiglottis<00:03:10.079> is<00:03:10.680> preventing<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.910> soft<00:03:12.239> palate

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
epiglottis is preventing the soft palate

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.550 
epiglottis is preventing the soft palate
from<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:13.170> up<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:14.190> acts<00:03:14.489> like<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.910> latch<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:16.170> if

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
from going up it acts like a latch so if

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
from going up it acts like a latch so if
you<00:03:16.769> want<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.130> elevate<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.730> soft<00:03:18.030> palate<00:03:18.450> you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you want to elevate the soft palate you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.220 
you want to elevate the soft palate you
first<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.739> move<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> epiglottis<00:03:20.579> down

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
first have to move the epiglottis down

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.670 
first have to move the epiglottis down
to<00:03:22.230> cover<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.860> windpipe<00:03:24.079> only<00:03:25.079> then<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
to cover the windpipe only then in the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.910 
to cover the windpipe only then in the
soft<00:03:25.950> palate<00:03:26.340> be<00:03:26.519> elevated<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.230> why<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
soft palate be elevated that is why a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.620 
soft palate be elevated that is why a
horse<00:03:29.600> cannot<00:03:30.600> breathe<00:03:31.500> through<00:03:32.489> its<00:03:33.180> mouth

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
horse cannot breathe through its mouth

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.100 
horse cannot breathe through its mouth
it<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.950> through<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.180> can't<00:03:36.420> go<00:03:36.630> into

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
it can go through but it can't go into

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.440 
it can go through but it can't go into
the<00:03:37.260> lungs
