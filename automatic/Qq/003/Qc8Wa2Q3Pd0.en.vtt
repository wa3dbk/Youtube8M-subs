00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello today I am fulfilling a request 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.990
 One of my followers has long been 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:19.380
 she asked to make a video about my lipstick 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 honestly me very little lipstick in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 I mostly use shine 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.990
 of her very little that's the only 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:34.040
 as if I didn’t like that very much 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.200
 cosmetics but not there but no time 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 buy if u choose choose one 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.100
 the same color as doing a lot in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.059
 In general, you just pushed me to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.899
 what you need to go and buy yourself 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 Several new gloss lipsticks but new 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 I'll show you what I have now 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.710
 only 4 things you can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.439
 submit a budget blogger to girls 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 I have whole heaps in this girlfriend she 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.380
 general lover of lipstick newton 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 up to 1000 probably comes to but 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 what else do I want to say i always love 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 focus more on the eyes and can 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:26.970
 be therefore no need for me 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.090
 highlight find lips well that's what u 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.700
 Eat me 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.700
 1 is the usual hygienic lipstick 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.189
 peach nectar is called his firm 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.979
 it is in Ukraine only to 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:49.090
 Russia is usually moisturizing can be it 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.560
 almost transparent almost do not give color so 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.140
 barely such a natural shade 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.700
 some letters are brighter 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 before 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:12.230
 also here is the lumen and the third number not giving 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.819
 lipstick i really like when i'm at all 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.000
 I want attention to be riveted 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.790
 just to my eyes duck hair there is everything 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.170
 she didn’t pay much either 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:32.870
 attention and that's when it suits 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:36.040
 make-up to suit 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.280
 here is a fudge element number three 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.829
 but honestly here is the color I really 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.609
 like a look absolutely nude 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:51.530
 without any bad redheads there 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:53.959
 Shades of incomprehensible but the only thing 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.200
 holding on to your lips very badly if you 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.970
 I think if you want your makeup 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.069
 to help you go on for a long time 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.799
 here you are beautiful wind necessarily 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.130
 take with you because you have to 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.630
 somewhere around the hour probably tint up 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.090
 well maybe blowing 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.720
 and if you eat it at all 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.430
 it will not be instant and in the winter when 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.340
 I bought it for me a little bit 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.160
 overheard well i mean i missed 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 moisturizing we started to peel off and 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:34.370
 all this but in the summer now is quite 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.090
 still missing my favorite such brilliance 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.860
 for lips 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:45.220
 this is the tenth number and in the rank of laurent here 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.660
 such a color with gold sparkles 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.230
 so pink orange probably yes 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.780
 some way you 10 that i am releasing very 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.580
 nice so thick 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.480
 maybe even a little sticky 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.930
 but there is an impression but 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:10.100
 not sticky he's probably thick somehow 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.730
 lays down not sticky here so good so not 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:18.440
 need to hold my lips for the second time 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:24.710
 really like probably would have bought more 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:28.430
 of course although honestly there is probably 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.800
 no replacement and cheaper yes I bought by 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:38.300
 discount 225 hryvnia but I would not say that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.360
 I'm right here in love with him and here on 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.160
 although very good honestly I think 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.150
 it's worth trying anyway 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.760
 I tried it last time I was at 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.720
 we are in store maiden of this type watson 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.280
 ate such all sorts 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.820
 shops and took herself an art-make-up in general 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.300
 never paid for this brand 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.360
 attention is still such a beautiful color and 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:13.510
 you know what he's like in a tube 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.810
 and on the lips and he look so thick 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:20.970
 generally well worth the cost 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:31.470
 and here now see the tracks took yes now 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:33.300
 closer to 1 and already this color yes that is 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.800
 no need to spend a hundred times but here again 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:42.060
 spent and you know holding on for very long 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:46.350
 lips moisturize pretty yes such 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.080
 so thick pretty 0 but not lefke 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.750
 thick we are not sculpting these two 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.729
 probably now the only one favorite 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.940
 shiller will not give for the upcoming yes with 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.790
 sparkles and grass weight spangle completely 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.919
 and here is the color I liked the color of it 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:08.370
 Summer seems to me good 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:12.300
 just before diluting make your little face 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.600
 a little brighter but it seems to me not 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.440
 passed such a normal color here it is 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.550
 my lipstick and everything honestly more 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.320
 nothing need to do this to me 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.930
 I want to go by myself 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.330
 all sorts of booth hands do not itch 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.310
 buy something but i am so busy 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:38.070
 an hour here is shown at this stage in general 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.979
 no time I go to the store only 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:45.300
 when I go to work in the store 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:46.950
 own yes for some reason then I can 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:53.910
 there is something to look quickly 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:56.090
 buy and of course a little bit later by this 7 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.110
 I'll take care of everything then I'll take off for you 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.600

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.440
 about my lipstick but we, as you understand, 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:11.020
 I love these pink shades 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:16.780
 pink yes it is any bright there more 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:19.060
 fashion before or vice versa with sparkles one 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.289
 time did not use only transparent 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:26.409
 shine 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:31.270
