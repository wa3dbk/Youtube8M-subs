00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.849
 Hi there, you are watching a video on these 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.230
 family with you alexey taranenko campaign 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.689
 lies continue to experiment with 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:14.960
 smartphones on android 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
 this time the middle price segment with 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.369
 we are the founder of 540 in general 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 fst 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.880
 the body of the smartphone has an unusual shape 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 upper bound to god 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 it gives it a highlight do 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.600
 recognizable style sustained throughout the unit 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.280
 function key rocker 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.800
 adjust the volume of the holes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.989
 dynamics even stub 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.660
 interface connectors having the same shape 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 case material matte plastic 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 structures swept 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.930
 side faces soft touch 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.070
 the back cover sits tight but overall 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 hull hands squeaks for 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150
 Access the memory card does not need to be removed 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 batteries 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.710
 despite seemingly inexpensive 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350
 materials looks just machine 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.700
 fine 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.350
 GDP 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.620
 weak spot is not worth it 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.570
 nets image just fine 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.790
 standard resolution 320 by 480 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.270
 points 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.980
 with such a diagonal looks just 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.950
 fine 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.540
 natural color rendition 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.910
 good brightness and viewing angles 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.720
 well that's why the resistive matrix 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 difficult to explain all the shortcomings such 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.440
 technology is evident 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.590
 you need to press the screen with effort 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.280
 gifts small element finger 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.040
 complicated 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.140
 but judging by the fact that there is no room on the body 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 attaching the lace externally to the stylus in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.800
 bundled will not be a problem is and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.920
 sens classmates 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 they also require pressing with effort 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.930
 getting used to their work is not easy 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.940
 current matrix selection error which could 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.130
 would scare away many potential 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.300
 buyers 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.870
 it is compensated by low cost 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.150
 devices 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359
 smartphone works on android 1 6 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.189
 but at the same time they decided to disguise it as 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.570
 newer 2 0 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.810
 copied lock screen many 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.630
 pictograms 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.230
 strange decision well the way it is 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.960
 In general, we have seriously worked on this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.850
 custom key shortcuts 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.520
 debt widgets with applications 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.570
 phone sms which is visible on all workers 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.450
 has become 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.420
 Yes, and canteens themselves 10 5 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 if you prefer, you can choose the standard 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.450
 android interface 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.840
 but jedique 540 is socialized by 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.760
 full except for the usual twitter and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.409
 Facebook 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.280
 There is an application for VKontakte 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.240
 but classmates is only a link to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.739
 mobile version of the site 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.150
 besides preinstalled 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.769
 some Yandex services if it 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.620
 pretty weird seeing demolition with you 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 Android 1 6 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 even considering the fact that his details beginners 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.329
 users 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.869
 music player in this 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:30.980
 model standards 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 media madrid did not become sound quality 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.220
 the average might be a little better than 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.539
 happily ltv ii 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.309
 have a cute radio 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.229
 of the interface 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.349
 built-in camera resolution 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.749
 only 3 megapixels are there 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.249
 Autofocus image quality is quite good 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.299
 phone chip unconverted 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.540
 video supported codecs divx and xvid smith 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.230
 but losing subcontracting apparatus all 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.289
 same not capable 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.949
 there are problems with sound codecs share and 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.039
 video girls 5 resolution released 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.259
 640 points 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.909
 our sample smartphone handled 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.719
 about half found at hand 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.459
 the movie 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.329
 game lovers will be happy good 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.489
 performance queue in total out in 3d 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.869
 graphics 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.289
 fst 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.330
 the same question turned out to be interesting 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.150
 great design performance 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.700
 work with video and for such a price you can 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.920
 forgive and resistive display
