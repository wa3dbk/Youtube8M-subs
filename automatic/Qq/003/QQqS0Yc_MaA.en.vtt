00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
engagement online and it struck me as a

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.710 
engagement online and it struck me as a
bit<00:00:18.670> of<00:00:18.700> a<00:00:18.820> struggle<00:00:19.000> with<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.330> private

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
bit of a struggle with the private

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.080 
bit of a struggle with the private
versus<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.200> personal<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:20.950> when<00:00:21.880> I<00:00:21.910> was

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
versus the personal and when I was

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.310 
versus the personal and when I was
reading<00:00:22.360> that<00:00:22.450> I<00:00:22.510> thought<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:22.870> actually<00:00:23.020> made

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
reading that I thought you actually made

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.380 
reading that I thought you actually made
a<00:00:23.380> very<00:00:23.500> interesting<00:00:24.040> choice<00:00:24.310> than<00:00:24.970> to<00:00:25.000> write

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
a very interesting choice than to write

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.310 
a very interesting choice than to write
a<00:00:25.420> book<00:00:25.660> that<00:00:25.960> is<00:00:26.110> extremely<00:00:26.860> personal<00:00:27.400> right

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
a book that is extremely personal right

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.249 
a book that is extremely personal right
so<00:00:29.320> what<00:00:30.220> I'm<00:00:30.340> going<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.610> answer<00:00:30.820> is<00:00:31.360> what<00:00:32.200> I

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
so what I'm going to answer is what I

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.520 
so what I'm going to answer is what I
say<00:00:32.529> very<00:00:33.100> commonly<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:34.300> this<00:00:34.480> question<00:00:34.690> that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
say very commonly to this question that

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.070 
say very commonly to this question that
on<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.670> myer<00:00:36.820> briggs<00:00:36.850> scale<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:37.510> scoring

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
on the myer briggs scale I scoring

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.470 
on the myer briggs scale I scoring
eighty-eight<00:00:38.500> percent<00:00:38.530> extrovert<00:00:39.490> and<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:40.450> I

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
eighty-eight percent extrovert and so I

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.390 
eighty-eight percent extrovert and so I
know<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.930> didn't<00:00:41.320> want<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.680> use<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.220> word

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
know you didn't want to use the word

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.850 
know you didn't want to use the word
brave<00:00:42.730> but<00:00:43.090> i<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.350> would<00:00:44.470> have<00:00:44.650> been

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
brave but i think it would have been

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.890 
brave but i think it would have been
more<00:00:45.160> brave<00:00:45.520> for<00:00:45.940> me<00:00:46.060> not<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.300> write<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.690> book

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
more brave for me not to write a book

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.960 
more brave for me not to write a book
that<00:00:47.110> wasn't<00:00:47.380> incredibly<00:00:47.650> personal<00:00:48.370> it's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
that wasn't incredibly personal it's

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.950 
that wasn't incredibly personal it's
interesting<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.660> because<00:00:49.780> I'm<00:00:50.290> always<00:00:51.130> very

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
interesting just because I'm always very

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780 
interesting just because I'm always very
open<00:00:52.960> about<00:00:53.110> my<00:00:53.260> life<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.920> way<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.070> am<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.399> I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
open about my life in the way I am and I

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.160 
open about my life in the way I am and I
think<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.180> even<00:00:55.360> though<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.780> site<00:00:55.989> was

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
think that even though the site was

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.660 
think that even though the site was
incredibly<00:00:56.739> personable<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.489> not

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
incredibly personable and not

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.520 
incredibly personable and not
necessarily<00:00:57.899> personal<00:00:58.899> which<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.350> line

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
necessarily personal which is the line

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.080 
necessarily personal which is the line
that<00:00:59.680> I<00:00:59.739> was<00:00:59.920> treading<00:01:00.250> with<00:01:00.610> having<00:01:00.970> to

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
that I was treading with having to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.690 
that I was treading with having to
explain<00:01:01.450> my<00:01:01.660> engagement<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.440> sort<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.280> decided

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
explain my engagement I sort of decided

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.179 
explain my engagement I sort of decided
to<00:01:04.059> own<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.989> fact<00:01:05.259> that<00:01:05.499> people<00:01:05.859> were<00:01:06.009> going

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
during the process of my getting engaged

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.709 
during the process of my getting engaged
and<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:57.999> function<00:01:58.899> of<00:01:59.020> that<00:01:59.319> it<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:01.689> a

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
and so as a function of that it was a

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.620 
and so as a function of that it was a
little<00:02:01.959> unusual<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.919> turned<00:02:03.669> it<00:02:03.849> into<00:02:04.029> a<00:02:04.270> bigger

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
little unusual I turned it into a bigger

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.649 
little unusual I turned it into a bigger
deal<00:02:04.719> than<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.139> had<00:02:05.349> to<00:02:05.499> be<00:02:05.529> I<00:02:05.889> think<00:02:06.659> calling

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
deal than it had to be I think calling

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.029 
deal than it had to be I think calling
yourself<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.020> man<00:02:08.170> repeller<00:02:08.410> it's<00:02:08.679> actually

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
yourself the man repeller it's actually

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.570 
yourself the man repeller it's actually
not<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.519> practically<00:02:10.149> repelling<00:02:10.840> men<00:02:11.019> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
not about practically repelling men is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.180 
not about practically repelling men is
definitely<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:12.480> i<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
definitely not i think that the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.220 
definitely not i think that the
trajectory<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> site<00:02:15.330> has<00:02:15.540> changed<00:02:15.960> so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
trajectory of the site has changed so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.680 
trajectory of the site has changed so
much<00:02:16.440> since<00:02:16.500> launch<00:02:17.100> i<00:02:17.490> was<00:02:17.850> only<00:02:18.120> 20<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:18.570> I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
much since launch i was only 20 when I

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.660 
much since launch i was only 20 when I
started<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> site<00:02:19.410> i<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.920> junior<00:02:20.460> in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
started the site i was a junior in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.400 
started the site i was a junior in
college<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.420> therefore<00:02:21.780> highly<00:02:22.410> ignorant

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
college and therefore highly ignorant

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.060 
college and therefore highly ignorant
and<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.240> as<00:02:27.660> I've<00:02:28.560> continued

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and I I think that as as I've continued

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.430 
and I I think that as as I've continued
working<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.670> site<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.180> sort<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.570> ideology

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
working on the site the sort of ideology
has<00:02:31.470> become<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:32.150> fine-tuned<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.390> finessed

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
has become very fine-tuned and finessed

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.750 
has become very fine-tuned and finessed
and<00:02:34.170> I've<00:02:34.500> been<00:02:34.860> saying<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.520> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and I've been saying that it's a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760 
and I've been saying that it's a
