00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
here's the other fire the only problem

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.030 
here's the other fire the only problem
with<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.840> takes<00:02:25.080> few<00:02:25.290> seconds<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.770> suck

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
with this is takes few seconds to suck

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.910 
with this is takes few seconds to suck
in<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.880> can't<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.240> move<00:02:27.420> around<00:02:27.920> when

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
in and you can't really move around when

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.730 
in and you can't really move around when
you're<00:02:29.100> when<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.490> use<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:31.470> nice

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you're when you use that so it's nice

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.070 
you're when you use that so it's nice
it's<00:02:32.040> powerful<00:02:32.460> strong<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.390> kind<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.930> keeps

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
it's powerful strong but kind of keeps

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.740 
it's powerful strong but kind of keeps
you<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> little<00:02:34.470> mobile<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> third

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you a little mobile and then the third

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.020 
you a little mobile and then the third
thing<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.320> electricity<00:02:37.800> which<00:02:38.190> this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
thing is this electricity which this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.020 
thing is this electricity which this
kind<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.420> keeps<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.050> mobile<00:02:40.560> also<00:02:41.030> so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030

kind of keeps you a mobile also so
that's<00:02:42.390> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.660> thing<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.020> these<00:02:43.110> trap

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that's kind of thing with these trap

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.840 
that's kind of thing with these trap
masters<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.950> some<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.520> these<00:02:44.580> great

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
masters is some of them have these great

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.510 
masters is some of them have these great
powerful<00:02:45.360> abilities<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:47.160> while<00:02:47.370> they're

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
powerful abilities but while they're

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.940 
powerful abilities but while they're
doing<00:02:47.730> them<00:02:48.030> can't<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.260> move<00:02:49.440> kind<00:02:49.890> of

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
doing them can't really move kind of

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.350 
doing them can't really move kind of
like<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.310> snapshot<00:02:50.880> when<00:02:51.090> he's<00:02:51.210> doing

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
like you know snapshot when he's doing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.180 
like you know snapshot when he's doing
out<00:02:51.570> his<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.840> tidal<00:02:52.260> wave<00:02:52.380> there<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.980> kind

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
out his little tidal wave there you kind

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.330 
out his little tidal wave there you kind
of<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.370> stuck<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.790> place<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.860> his<00:02:56.070> soul

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
of get stuck in place and then his soul

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.430 
of get stuck in place and then his soul
gem<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.090> sort<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.450> fire<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.110> shield

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
gem is you sort of fire up the shield

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.820 
gem is you sort of fire up the shield
and<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.880> let<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.450> brute<00:03:01.260> let's<00:03:01.680> see

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and then you let it go brute let's see

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.040 
and then you let it go brute let's see
it's<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> timer<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:03.060> fired<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.780> let<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
it's on the timer it fired up you let it

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.620 
it's on the timer it fired up you let it
go<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.320> then<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.560> tap<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:06.000> timing<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
go and then you tap the timing that's a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.690 
go and then you tap the timing that's a
little<00:03:06.780> weird<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.080> tap<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.850> square<00:03:08.850> again

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
little weird you tap the square again

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.699 
little weird you tap the square again
and<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.390> he<00:03:11.480> jumps<00:03:11.840> through<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.080> shield<00:03:12.410> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
and then he jumps through the shield and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.880 
and then he jumps through the shield and
turns<00:03:12.920> into<00:03:13.160> line<00:03:13.520> form<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.380> look<00:03:15.380> at<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.590> it

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
turns into line form but look at that it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.850 
turns into line form but look at that it
lasts<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.550> like<00:03:16.670> two<00:03:16.910> seconds<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.620> do

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
lasts for like two seconds you can do

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.449 
lasts for like two seconds you can do
attacks<00:03:20.290> get<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.410> charged<00:03:21.800> up<00:03:21.950> again<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.340> can

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
attacks get it charged up again you can

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.030 
attacks get it charged up again you can
do<00:03:22.580> attacks<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.270> there<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.530> looks<00:03:24.709> kind<00:03:24.950> of
