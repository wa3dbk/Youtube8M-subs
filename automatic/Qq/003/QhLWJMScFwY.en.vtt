00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010 
him and make him more so see more
important<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> sudden<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.420> yeah

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
important all of a sudden you get yeah

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
important all of a sudden you get yeah
you<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> secondary<00:01:50.100> than<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.579> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you get the secondary than this in this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.620 
you get the secondary than this in this
image<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> gives<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.810> storytelling

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
image and then it gives the storytelling

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
image and then it gives the storytelling
quite<00:01:54.630> quite<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> boost<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.869> that's<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
quite quite a boost so that's going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.670 
quite quite a boost so that's going to
be<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> first<00:02:00.840> thing<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> second

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
be the first thing and then the second

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
be the first thing and then the second
thing<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.490> details<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:04.670> guess<00:02:05.689> what

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
thing is the details so I guess what

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.109 
thing is the details so I guess what
happened<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> artist

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
happened here is that is just the artist

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
happened here is that is just the artist
just<00:02:09.300> ran<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> time<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.229> didn't<00:02:10.500> have

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
just ran out of time or didn't have

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.880 
just ran out of time or didn't have
then<00:02:11.519> plan<00:02:11.849> his<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.239> properly<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.840> ended<00:02:13.799> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
then plan his time properly and ended up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
then plan his time properly and ended up
with<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.849> know<00:02:15.090> being<00:02:15.659> able<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.260> less<00:02:16.620> than

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
with you know being able to do less than

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.190 
with you know being able to do less than
he<00:02:17.010> intended<00:02:17.459> at<00:02:18.000> first<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:18.930> seems

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
he intended at first but it really seems

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.020 
he intended at first but it really seems
like<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.590> character<00:02:19.829> was<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.819> lot

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
like this character was you know a lot

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.280 
like this character was you know a lot
of<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.269> was<00:02:21.420> spent<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.689> that<00:02:21.810> character<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
of time was spent on that character and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.720 
of time was spent on that character and
in<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.500> environment<00:02:22.980> which<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.549> like<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
in the environment which is more like a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.670 
in the environment which is more like a
second<00:02:24.120> thought<00:02:24.269> where<00:02:25.140> everything<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
second thought where everything is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.949 
second thought where everything is
really<00:02:25.860> blocky<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.640> laser-cut<00:02:27.510> almost

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
really blocky like laser-cut almost

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.580 
really blocky like laser-cut almost
there's<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.709> throne<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.470> you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
there's this throne and it's just you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
there's this throne and it's just you
know<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.129> guy<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.120> would

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
know like for a guy like that you would

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.569 
know like for a guy like that you would
probably<00:02:33.870> imagine<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.440> he'd<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> better

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
probably imagine that he'd get a better

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.569 
probably imagine that he'd get a better
throne<00:02:35.940> done<00:02:36.269> he<00:02:37.109> probably<00:02:37.379> has<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
throne done he probably has the the

probably<00:02:45.959> imagine<00:02:46.319> maybe<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.590> haven't<00:02:46.799> liked

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
probably imagine maybe I haven't liked

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.740 
probably imagine maybe I haven't liked
gems<00:02:47.879> or<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> gold<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.709> intricate<00:02:50.700> sort<00:02:51.659> of

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
thing and that's to sort of damage it a

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.940 
thing and that's to sort of damage it a
lot<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.000> add<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> lot<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.650> imperfection<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.799> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
lot so add a lot of imperfection to this

lot so add a lot of imperfection to this
throne<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:08.849> of<00:03:08.909> cracks<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.480> make<00:03:09.989> it

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
throne and a lot of cracks and make it

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.479 
throne and a lot of cracks and make it
feel<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:11.010> bit<00:03:11.129> more<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
feel like a little bit more like the

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.949 
feel like a little bit more like the
character<00:03:11.909> right<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.389> character<00:03:12.750> looks

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
character right so the character looks

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.569 
character right so the character looks
like<00:03:13.019> looks<00:03:13.620> beat<00:03:13.889> up<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.129> little<00:03:14.340> bit<00:03:14.459> it's

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
like looks beat up a little bit it's

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.330 
like looks beat up a little bit it's
full<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.819> blood<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.739> I'm<00:03:16.739> gonna<00:03:16.919> give<00:03:17.069> him<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
full of blood and I'm gonna give him a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280 
full of blood and I'm gonna give him a
throne<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.819> sort<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.750> matches<00:03:19.079> them<00:03:19.199> a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
throne that sort of matches them a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
throne that sort of matches them a
little<00:03:19.470> bit<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:20.419> so<00:03:23.449> that's<00:03:24.919> yeah<00:03:25.919> like<00:03:26.190> I

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
little bit more so that's yeah like I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.400 
little bit more so that's yeah like I
like<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.579> said<00:03:26.819> it's<00:03:27.000> probably<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> time

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
like I said it's probably like a time

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.409 
like I said it's probably like a time
thing<00:03:28.769> or<00:03:28.949> the<00:03:29.099> artist<00:03:29.430> didn't<00:03:29.669> have<00:03:29.879> quite

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
thing or the artist didn't have quite

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.530 
thing or the artist didn't have quite
the<00:03:30.569> time<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.169> finish<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.470> up<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.370> hey<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.480> is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the time you have and even if it wasn't

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.150 
the time you have and even if it wasn't
3d<00:03:38.669> could<00:03:39.090> have<00:03:39.180> been<00:03:39.299> just<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.720> post<00:03:40.560> process

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
3d could have been just a post process

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.470 
3d could have been just a post process
like<00:03:41.310> I'm<00:03:41.430> doing<00:03:41.639> right<00:03:41.760> now<00:03:41.819> adding<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.329> little

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
like I'm doing right now adding a little

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.849 
like I'm doing right now adding a little
bit<00:03:42.660> more<00:03:42.810> details<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.290> little<00:03:43.470> bit<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.650> dirt

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
bit more details a little bit of dirt

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.470 
bit more details a little bit of dirt
here<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.310> there<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.849> would<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.269> would<00:03:45.329> have

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
here and there it would it would have

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.610 
here and there it would it would have
you<00:03:46.019> know<00:03:46.109> gone<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.680> long<00:03:46.829> way<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.280> long<00:03:47.819> way<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
you know gone a long way a long way and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.250 
you know gone a long way a long way and
I<00:03:49.760> think<00:03:50.760> just<00:03:51.120> adding<00:03:51.449> this<00:03:51.569> kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.930> this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
I think just adding this kind of this

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.080 
I think just adding this kind of this
kind<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.650> detail<00:03:54.739> actually<00:03:55.739> helps<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.909> read

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
kind of detail actually helps the read

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.490 
kind of detail actually helps the read
of<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.389> entire<00:03:57.810> image<00:03:58.049> because<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
of the entire image because the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.289 
of the entire image because the
character<00:03:58.829> himself<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.430> very<00:03:59.790> very<00:04:00.090> detailed

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
character himself was very very detailed

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.689 
character himself was very very detailed
and<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.440> sort<00:04:01.919> of<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.069> surrounding<00:04:02.579> and

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
and then the sort of the surrounding and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.339 
and then the sort of the surrounding and
like<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.000> direct<00:04:03.389> surrounding<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:03.930> throne

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
like the direct surrounding that throne

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.219 
like the direct surrounding that throne
itself<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.299> having<00:04:06.299> like<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> perfect

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
itself and the having like a perfect

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.140 
itself and the having like a perfect
floor<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.949> you<00:04:08.190> know<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.489> much<00:04:08.639> going<00:04:08.909> on<00:04:08.970> in

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
floor and you know not much going on in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.039 
floor and you know not much going on in
the<00:04:09.239> background<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.659> attract<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.989> attention

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the background to attract the attention

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.039 
the background to attract the attention
it<00:04:10.799> felt<00:04:11.129> like<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.329> contrast<00:04:12.810> and

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
it felt like the the contrast and

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.710 
it felt like the the contrast and
details<00:04:13.409> was<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.889> way<00:04:14.099> too<00:04:14.340> high<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:14.909> it

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
details was just way too high and it

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.180 
details was just way too high and it
just<00:04:15.930> didn't<00:04:16.470> feel<00:04:16.560> right<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.039> then<00:04:19.190> by

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
just didn't feel right and then by

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.009 
just didn't feel right and then by
having<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.729> second<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.299> second<00:04:21.690> sort<00:04:21.959> of

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
having the second the second sort of

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.440 
having the second the second sort of
level<00:04:22.349> of<00:04:22.440> details<00:04:22.800> all<00:04:23.099> over<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> place

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
level of details all over the place

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.760 
level of details all over the place
now<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.960> just<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.290> feels<00:04:25.470> like

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
now it just it just feels like

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.340 
now it just it just feels like
everything<00:04:26.070> belongs<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:27.540> there<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.050> know<00:04:28.170> and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
everything belongs in there you know and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.250 
everything belongs in there you know and
it's<00:04:29.310> equally<00:04:29.850> sort<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.240> detailed<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:30.810> it

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
it's equally sort of detailed so it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.740 
it's equally sort of detailed so it
works<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.560> lot<00:04:31.620> better<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.420> see<00:04:33.630> also

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
works a lot better and you can see also

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.450 
works a lot better and you can see also
that<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.050> cropped<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.740> left<00:04:34.920> side<00:04:35.100> here<00:04:35.310> a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
that I cropped on the left side here a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.700 
that I cropped on the left side here a
little<00:04:35.730> bit<00:04:35.850> because<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.540> was<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.530> lot<00:04:37.680> of

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
little bit because it was just a lot of

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.240 
little bit because it was just a lot of
space<00:04:37.920> there<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:40.320> warrant<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.920> this

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
space there and to to warrant this this

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.390 
space there and to to warrant this this
this<00:04:42.240> space<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.990> guess<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.890> would<00:04:44.010> have<00:04:44.040> need

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
this space I guess you would have need

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.730 
this space I guess you would have need
needed<00:04:44.940> something<00:04:45.300> else<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.740> another

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
needed something else like a another

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.160 
needed something else like a another
read<00:04:47.040> in<00:04:47.220> there<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.520> maybe<00:04:47.730> some<00:04:48.480> sort<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.810> like

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
read in there so maybe some sort of like

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.170 
read in there so maybe some sort of like
a<00:04:49.200> Baker<00:04:49.680> zombie<00:04:50.220> or<00:04:50.430> something<00:04:50.850> like<00:04:50.970> that

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
a Baker zombie or something like that

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.180 
a Baker zombie or something like that
but<00:04:51.780> yeah<00:04:52.290> there<00:04:52.440> wasn't<00:04:52.710> anything<00:04:52.920> like<00:04:53.130> that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
but yeah there wasn't anything like that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.400 
but yeah there wasn't anything like that
so<00:04:53.550> might<00:04:54.150> as<00:04:54.270> well<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:54.570> crop<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.900> out<00:04:55.020> it's

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
so might as well just crop it out it's

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
so might as well just crop it out it's
it<00:04:56.370> reads<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.640> little<00:04:56.730> bit<00:04:56.940> better<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.450> way

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
it reads a little bit better this way

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.240 
it reads a little bit better this way
what<00:04:59.430> I'm<00:04:59.490> gonna<00:04:59.610> be<00:04:59.760> doing<00:05:00.090> finally<00:05:00.600> here<00:05:00.990> is

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
what I'm gonna be doing finally here is

so I'm gonna make the entire scene some

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.130 
so I'm gonna make the entire scene some
more<00:05:34.950> blue<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.790> little<00:05:36.060> bit<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.630> know<00:05:36.660> give<00:05:37.020> it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
more blue a little bit you know give it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.080 
more blue a little bit you know give it
a<00:05:37.200> tint<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.530> blue<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.010> then<00:05:38.430> have<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.820> main

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
a tint of blue and then have the main

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.940 
a tint of blue and then have the main
character<00:05:39.120> in<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.690> center<00:05:40.020> be<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.560> little<00:05:40.860> bit

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
character in the center be a little bit

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.700 
character in the center be a little bit
redder<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.030> get<00:05:42.270> sort<00:05:42.900> of<00:05:42.930> this<00:05:43.260> contrast

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
redder so you get sort of this contrast

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.110 
redder so you get sort of this contrast
between<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.070> main<00:05:44.190> character<00:05:44.310> which<00:05:44.730> is<00:05:44.760> sort

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
between the main character which is sort

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.450 
between the main character which is sort
of<00:05:45.180> warm<00:05:45.510> around<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.930> around<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.530> Sun<00:05:47.100> around

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
of warm around the around the Sun around

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.250 
of warm around the around the Sun around
the<00:05:47.670> lights<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.420> then<00:05:48.540> everything<00:05:48.870> else<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.230> a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
the lights and then everything else is a

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.750 
the lights and then everything else is a
little<00:05:49.410> bit<00:05:49.590> bluish<00:05:49.830> sort<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.340> in<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.520> shadow

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
little bit bluish sort of in the shadow

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.020 
little bit bluish sort of in the shadow
and<00:05:51.290> it<00:05:52.290> gets<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:53.040> gives<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.340> second<00:05:53.640> read<00:05:53.760> a

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
and it gets it gives the second read a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.270 
and it gets it gives the second read a
better<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:55.290> makes<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.770> little<00:05:56.010> bit<00:05:56.160> more

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
better it makes it a little bit more

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.580 
better it makes it a little bit more
obvious<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.580> guess<00:05:56.760> so<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.510> hope<00:05:58.230> this<00:05:58.440> was

obvious I guess so I hope this was

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.060 
obvious I guess so I hope this was
