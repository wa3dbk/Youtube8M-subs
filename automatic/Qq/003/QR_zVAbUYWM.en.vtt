00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
of bread Jen just taking a small piece

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.080 
of bread Jen just taking a small piece
of<00:04:46.610> bread<00:04:47.200> almost<00:04:48.200> like<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.410> croute<00:04:49.090> slightly

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
of bread almost like a croute slightly

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.830 
of bread almost like a croute slightly
thinned<00:04:50.450> up<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.770> apply<00:04:55.220> some<00:04:55.700> butter<00:04:56.480> on<00:04:56.660> both

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
thinned up so apply some butter on both

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.220 
thinned up so apply some butter on both
sides<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.380> bread<00:04:57.590> made<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.040> salt<00:04:59.170> on<00:05:00.170> both

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.920 
sides of the bread made of salt on both
sides<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.400> bit<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.700> cracked<00:05:02.060> pepper

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.140 

into<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.080> pan

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
into the pan

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.720 
into the pan
so<00:05:09.900> let<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.200> crisp<00:05:10.560> up<00:05:10.740> slightly<00:05:11.070> from<00:05:11.400> both

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
so let this crisp up slightly from both

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.030 
so let this crisp up slightly from both
the<00:05:11.880> sides<00:05:12.120> just<00:05:12.780> finely<00:05:13.200> chopped<00:05:13.470> mushrooms

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
the sides just finely chopped mushrooms

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.909 
the sides just finely chopped mushrooms
now<00:05:15.889> let<00:05:16.889> me<00:05:17.070> take<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.850> away<00:05:17.970> in<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> small

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
now let me take it away in a small

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.820 
now let me take it away in a small
ramekin<00:05:19.919> like<00:05:20.220> this<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.330> for<00:05:21.510> later

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
ramekin like this so this is for later

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.170 
ramekin like this so this is for later
so<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.889> can<00:05:22.980> see<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.520> now<00:05:23.669> with<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.910> flour

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
so you can see that now with the flour

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.450 
so you can see that now with the flour
in<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.450> mushrooms<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.350> soup<00:05:25.710> has<00:05:25.919> slightly

in the mushrooms the soup has slightly

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.870 
in the mushrooms the soup has slightly
thickened<00:05:27.030> up<00:05:27.150> soups<00:05:27.780> almost<00:05:28.110> ready<00:05:28.880> let's
