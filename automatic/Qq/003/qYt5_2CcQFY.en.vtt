going to show you guys how to I put a
MSD<00:00:18.240> ignition<00:00:18.360> on<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.970> only<00:00:20.970> reason<00:00:21.270> why<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
MSD ignition on here only reason why I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.820 
MSD ignition on here only reason why I
did<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:21.840> $30<00:00:22.410> cheaper<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
did is because $30 cheaper than a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.450 
did is because $30 cheaper than a
factory<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.660> probably<00:00:24.660> works<00:00:24.840> better<00:00:24.930> um

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
factory and it probably works better um

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
factory and it probably works better um

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
that holds the coil down and the bolts

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.640 
that holds the coil down and the bolts
underneath<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.510> bolted<00:02:28.870> together<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.959> then

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
underneath that bolted together and then
