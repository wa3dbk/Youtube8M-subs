00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello to all i rem geeks area 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.990
 point of being today it's in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.530
 this little video we will make a man 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 boxing girl x3 a little walkman 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.809
 hd audio is conquered and able to read 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.970
 puddle type files in high 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.990
 definition up to 24 bits 192 kg art this 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 little walker was kindly 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 loaned by audio garden so we 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.700
 can do our tests and our 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.290
 article here is the box 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.890
 in this one we find in the first place 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.809
 a small notice that asks us 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.559
 to go to update the firmware 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.050
 before you start use the fio a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.410
 small advertisement 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 the girl at x3 in himself this little 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.430
 walkman so packed in big oak 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.800
 in plastic 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.390
 we also find two small protection 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.900
 anti protection of smartphones that are 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.070
 offered with the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:08.960
 the walkman of the instructions of use a 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.690
 usb charging cable as well as a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 jack cable rca to be able to use the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:30.010
 coaxial output that is on the device 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:35.270
 so here we can see here that he 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 has a little protection that is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.610
 offered with the device that is when 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.100
 even a little light protection but 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.410
 still a good note of intent 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.070
 good attention by the manufacturer 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.580
 So here is the ass in itself 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.920
 this is the reason why these three 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:01.700
 sides we find a small small entrance 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.300
 for a micro SD card on the bottom 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.920
 so we took it 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 reloading taking a line to 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.750
 high on that side the little hold button 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.250
 finally a lot of luck happily 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.360
 press a button while we are doing 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.830
 he listens on top we have another 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.570
 side to see the coaxial out 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.040
 so it's with the small the little cable 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.230
 that efforts while ago a 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.450
 small notch to resist the device 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.520
 completely and the headphone output that is 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.780
 on that side 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.390
 so here we have the usual buttons 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.710
 play pause etc to navigate in the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.940
 menus on this screen i'm going to light it up 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:57.370
 have a little bit of the gear menu 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.360
 So here we are in one in one 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:06.770
 fairly classic tree 1 with one 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.530
 can choose the read lists read 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.600
 music there if we go there already 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.680
 there inside the musics that are 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.220
 preinstalled purposeful to make a run of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.830
 ten years of samples to make you 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:28.330
 see just here is the difference with a 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:31.210
 iphone 5 like that you see level of 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.110
 size 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:40.490
 so here is the article on the test of this 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.130
 little girl at x3 will be online soon 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.940
 on geeks aerea point net 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.940
 See you later friends
