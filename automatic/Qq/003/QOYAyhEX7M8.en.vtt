00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.339 
we are looking at this seed it is blank
and<00:00:08.480> this<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:10.040> completely<00:00:11.040> flat<00:00:11.990> seed<00:00:12.990> but

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
and this is a completely flat seed but

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.689 
and this is a completely flat seed but
it<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.219> ice<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:16.190> we'll<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.340> start<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it but it is ice but we'll just start it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.170 
it but it is ice but we'll just start it
up<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.320> yeah<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.770> completely<00:00:20.520> ice<00:00:20.789> i'm

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.140 
up but yeah this is completely ice i'm
pretty<00:00:21.390> sure<00:00:21.570> i<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:21.960> there<00:00:22.350> might<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.150> bit

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
pretty sure i think there might be a bit

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.080 
pretty sure i think there might be a bit
of<00:00:24.269> land<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> spawn<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.350> ice<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.980> most<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
of land but you spawn on ice and most of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
of land but you spawn on ice and most of
it<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.560> flat<00:00:28.560> ice<00:00:29.570> but<00:00:30.890> yeah<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.279> you're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
some big mountains but oh yeah so yeah

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
some big mountains but oh yeah so yeah
there<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:25.049> some<00:01:25.200> mountains<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.860> here

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
there is there's some mountains up here

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.700 
there is there's some mountains up here
that's<00:01:26.250> pretty<00:01:26.549> cool<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.270> get

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's pretty cool because you get

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.810 
that's pretty cool because you get
completely<00:01:28.710> flat<00:01:29.040> over<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> then

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
completely flat over there and then

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.230 
completely flat over there and then
mountains<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.950> think<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
mountains over here I think that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.679 
mountains over here I think that
actually<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.530> map<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.689> get

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
actually is like a really good map I get

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
actually is like a really good map I get
the<00:01:36.840> best<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.380> both<00:01:38.329> worlds<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.520> yeah<00:01:41.520> um

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the best of both worlds but yeah um

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
the best of both worlds but yeah um
that's<00:01:42.740> that's<00:01:43.740> pretty<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that's that's pretty much it for the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.359 
that's that's pretty much it for the
seed<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.390> flat<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:46.950> mountains
