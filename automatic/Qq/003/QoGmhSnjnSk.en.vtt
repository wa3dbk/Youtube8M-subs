00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.310
 Yes if you enter the house 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
 You are done 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.240
 On pulling out 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.140
 I will introduce necessary things to the bird 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.540
 Gamers 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.460
 Size is 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.740
 I can say anything 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 Jite needs an electric guitar first 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.780
 next 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 I said something 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 A lot of amp curtain indwelling position, so far layout is necessary 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
 Let's do this 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.750
 Peter and Toshiba's Booth 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.190
 Is required 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 And to be in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.590
 Do you see what you like? 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.640
 Please make it glow in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 It seems that seven in the US 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.270
 And to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.310
 I'm trying to make such a return 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.180
 Guitar sound 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330
 If there is such a stand 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.210
 To 2 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.620
 Make such a point. 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 Being pulled away 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 It will be other than this 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.829
 Prefectural tax and ingredients should be tech-on 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.840
 It seems like you said that you want to come to see this lpic 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 I also put out specifications 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 The sound of the market's hound put me in to make 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.839
 Predator will also be normal 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.119
 I do the Macnica reproduction words 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.709
 Paris before closing business when transferring capacity 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 There was no one left to wear 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.899
 It is so 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:36.469
 And that it is collected to 8 degrees of adhesion at 10 o'clock and it is published 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.449
 so 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.419
 Iwate has a case with such a concept case 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.569
 One time 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.259
 15th day 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.259
 Carry Astellas eclipse 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.239
 And s track that sometimes got me 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.189
 You will need struts 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
 Cut off 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.329
 It disappears when it sees 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.349
 That's why 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.349
 Celebrity 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 That's the station east street 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.819
 First 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.289
 Top required 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:37.299
 Transparent glass is at least 17 cities in the middle of the previous history 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.009
 Three or less 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.109
 By any means 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.869
 It was a goal at first 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.319
 It is already 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.689
 And then there's a place for genes and a place for layouts. 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 consider 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.589
 It is above 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.239
 In a row 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.009
 ecb prediction 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.009
 I took a step back 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.109
 By the way today is 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.309
 Correspond to the English 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.839
 Go in and out 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.969
