00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
corners and that's why the lap time

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.370

suffered<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.180> much<00:01:10.360> on<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.659> bike<00:01:10.869> compared

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
other good things about it are great but

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.310 
other good things about it are great but
the<00:01:14.890> acceleration<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.050> typical

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320

when I used to raise those bikes we

I<00:02:11.629> think<00:02:12.439> it's<00:02:12.530> getting<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.799> little<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.099> long

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I think it's getting a little bit long
