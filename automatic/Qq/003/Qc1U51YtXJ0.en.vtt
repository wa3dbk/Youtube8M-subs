here<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.189> my<00:00:08.490> trusty<00:00:09.080> Canon<00:00:10.080> 60d<00:00:14.210> now<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.360> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
here on my trusty Canon 60d now this is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
here on my trusty Canon 60d now this is
not<00:00:15.719> an<00:00:15.900> EFS<00:00:16.529> lens<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.279> mounts<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
not an EFS lens so it mounts on the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.740 
not an EFS lens so it mounts on the
redline<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.189> so<00:00:20.189> even<00:00:20.640> though<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.270> 50

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
redline and so even though it's a 50

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.560 
redline and so even though it's a 50
prime<00:00:22.050> lens<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> crop<00:00:23.519> sensor<00:00:23.570> everything's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
prime lens on a crop sensor everything's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.950 
prime lens on a crop sensor everything's
magnified<00:00:25.519> 1.6<00:00:26.519> times<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.300> comes<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
magnified 1.6 times so that comes out to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.429 
magnified 1.6 times so that comes out to
about<00:00:28.050> 80<00:00:28.949> millimeters<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.439> something

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
about 80 millimeters I think something

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
about 80 millimeters I think something
like<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.899> if<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> full

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
like that so if you put this on a full

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.569 
like that so if you put this on a full
crop<00:00:36.710> sensor<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.950> would<00:00:38.370> um<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.160> look<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
crop sensor it would um it would look a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.110 
crop sensor it would um it would look a
lot<00:00:41.820> wider<00:00:42.149> than<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> does<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.620> crop<00:00:43.920> sensor

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
lot wider than it does on a crop sensor

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.680 
lot wider than it does on a crop sensor
such<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> 60d<00:00:46.260> 70<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.520> any<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> rebel

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
such as the 60d 70 or any of the rebel

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.279 
such as the 60d 70 or any of the rebel
series<00:00:48.930> cameras<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.539> outside<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> what

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
series cameras but outside this is what

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.240 
series cameras but outside this is what
it<00:00:52.379> looks<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it looks like

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.819 
it looks like
keep<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> mind<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.350> protection<00:00:55.350> filter

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
keep in mind I have a protection filter

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
keep in mind I have a protection filter
on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> top<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.969> quite<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
on the top here so it's not quite that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
on the top here so it's not quite that
long<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.829> short<00:00:59.070> lens<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
long but it's a pretty short lens I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
long but it's a pretty short lens I
think<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> smallest<00:01:00.570> lens<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.260> Canon

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
think it's the smallest lens that Canon

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.750 
think it's the smallest lens that Canon
makes<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.219> terms<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.699> size<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:05.040> looks<00:01:05.369> alright

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
makes in terms of size it looks alright

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.250 
makes in terms of size it looks alright
on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.810> bodies<00:01:07.500> um<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
on the on bodies um it's it's like the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
on the on bodies um it's it's like the
cheapest<00:01:10.770> build<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.180> possibly

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
cheapest build you could possibly

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.249 
cheapest build you could possibly
imagine<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.460> polish<00:01:14.960> plastic<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
imagine it's just this polish plastic I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.340 
imagine it's just this polish plastic I
mean<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> looks<00:01:16.890> alright<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.460> mean<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
mean it looks alright I mean it but it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.730 
mean it looks alright I mean it but it
looks<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> toy<00:01:24.320> take<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
looks kind of like a toy take off the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.050 
looks kind of like a toy take off the
cover<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> you'll<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
cover and you'll see that it is a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
cover and you'll see that it is a
fifty-two<00:01:27.950> millimeter<00:01:28.950> filter<00:01:29.939> size<00:01:31.009> see<00:01:32.009> if

just use that right there it's usable

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.999 
just use that right there it's usable
but<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.429> not<00:02:08.759> um<00:02:09.050> not<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.200> fun<00:02:10.440> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
but it's it's not um not that fun you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
but it's it's not um not that fun you
have<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.760> steady<00:02:12.120> hands<00:02:12.540> if

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
have to have pretty steady hands if

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
have to have pretty steady hands if
you're<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> want<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.450> fine-tune<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you're going to want to fine-tune it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.180 
you're going to want to fine-tune it
there<00:02:16.620> manually<00:02:18.020> autofocus<00:02:19.020> speed<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.730> decent

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
there manually autofocus speed is decent

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.660 
there manually autofocus speed is decent
keep<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.340> mind<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.120> lens<00:02:24.810> cost<00:02:25.260> roughly

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
keep in mind that this lens cost roughly

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.540 
keep in mind that this lens cost roughly
$100<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:28.290> not<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.099> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> have

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
$100 so it's not you know going to have

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.759 
$100 so it's not you know going to have
USM<00:02:30.180> focus<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:31.050> anything<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:33.470> that's<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:36.769> 0

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.220 
to infinity no window or anything but
it's<00:02:42.599> decent<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.440> seems<00:02:43.709> pretty<00:02:43.920> accurate

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's decent and it seems pretty accurate

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.509 
it's decent and it seems pretty accurate
I'll<00:02:46.230> throw<00:02:46.440> up<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.709> pictures<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> minute

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
exterior you got one switch here for

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
exterior you got one switch here for
auto<00:02:57.030> manual<00:02:57.569> focus<00:02:57.989> so<00:03:01.459> yeah<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:04.409> front

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
filters so yeah so now we're going to

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.420 
filters so yeah so now we're going to
look<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.840> some<00:03:28.019> pictures<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> lens<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
look at some pictures of the lens to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.759 
look at some pictures of the lens to
give<00:03:29.549> an<00:03:29.610> idea<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:30.019> what<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.140> range<00:03:31.379> looks

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
give an idea of what the range looks

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.369 
give an idea of what the range looks
like<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> sharpness<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.030> whatnot<00:03:33.360> we<00:03:34.260> see

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
like in the sharpness and whatnot we see

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.910 
like in the sharpness and whatnot we see
if<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.709> crop<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.190> one<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:36.260> there<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.379> go<00:03:37.530> so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
if I can crop this one in there we go so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.199 
if I can crop this one in there we go so
focused<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.000> whiskers<00:03:39.420> here<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:41.209> this

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
focused on the whiskers here and this

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.300 
focused on the whiskers here and this
lens<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.629> really<00:03:42.930> sharp<00:03:43.819> surprisingly

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
lens is really sharp surprisingly

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.699 
lens is really sharp surprisingly
significantly<00:03:47.310> sharper<00:03:47.790> than<00:03:48.510> any<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
significantly sharper than any of the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.699 
significantly sharper than any of the
kit<00:03:49.920> lenses<00:03:51.590> out<00:03:52.590> there<00:03:52.920> um<00:03:57.470> here's<00:03:58.470> another

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
kit lenses out there um here's another

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.339 
kit lenses out there um here's another
one<00:03:58.950> here<00:03:59.189> to<00:03:59.489> give<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.090> an<00:04:00.180> idea<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
one here to give you an idea of the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.710 
one here to give you an idea of the
range<00:04:01.680> mainly<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> range<00:04:02.610> because<00:04:02.970> some<00:04:03.689> of

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
range mainly the range because some of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.780 
range mainly the range because some of
these<00:04:03.870> are<00:04:03.930> post<00:04:04.680> processed<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.580> Lightroom<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
these are post processed in Lightroom so

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.210 
these are post processed in Lightroom so
yeah<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.269> one<00:04:09.480> especially<00:04:10.099> it's<00:04:11.099> not

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
yeah this this one especially it's not

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.220 
yeah this this one especially it's not
too<00:04:11.400> far<00:04:11.610> off<00:04:11.640> from<00:04:11.939> the<00:04:12.030> original<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:12.659> this

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
too far off from the original but this

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.630 
too far off from the original but this
was<00:04:13.439> mainly<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.860> give<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.099> an<00:04:14.220> idea<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.549> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
was mainly to give you an idea of the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.990 
was mainly to give you an idea of the
range<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.440> here's<00:04:16.440> another<00:04:16.709> one<00:04:16.979> right<00:04:17.340> there

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
range and here's another one right there

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.890 
range and here's another one right there
so<00:04:18.959> uh<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:20.400> see<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.669> can<00:04:20.790> crop<00:04:21.000> in<00:04:21.209> on<00:04:21.359> those

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
so uh you see if I can crop in on those

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.409 
so uh you see if I can crop in on those
and<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.009> don't<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.220> how<00:04:23.340> sharp<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.940> expect

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
and I don't know how sharp you expect

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.180 
and I don't know how sharp you expect
your<00:04:24.570> clouds<00:04:24.810> because<00:04:25.350> clouds<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.949> fuzzy

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
your clouds because clouds are fuzzy

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.700 
your clouds because clouds are fuzzy
anyway<00:04:26.639> but<00:04:26.910> that's<00:04:27.810> what<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.139> crop<00:04:28.440> looks

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
anyway but that's what that crop looks

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.610 
anyway but that's what that crop looks
like<00:04:28.949> we'll<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:29.639> a<00:04:29.669> couple<00:04:29.820> more<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.240> here<00:04:30.270> I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
like we'll get a couple more up here I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.920 
like we'll get a couple more up here I
do<00:04:31.620> believe<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.220> only<00:04:32.490> played<00:04:32.910> with<00:04:33.120> contrast

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
do believe I only played with contrast

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.560 
do believe I only played with contrast
and<00:04:34.320> brightness<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.490> one<00:04:35.789> no<00:04:36.240> color

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and brightness on this one no color

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.529 
and brightness on this one no color
correction<00:04:37.320> or<00:04:37.470> sharpening<00:04:38.160> done<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.300> this

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
correction or sharpening done on this

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.120 
correction or sharpening done on this
one<00:04:39.720> let<00:04:39.900> me<00:04:39.930> see<00:04:40.110> if<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.259> can<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> crop<00:04:40.919> on

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
one let me see if I can get a crop on

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.430 
one let me see if I can get a crop on
that<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.970> show<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.389> what<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:42.720> looks<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.169> up

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
that to show you what that looks like up

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.370 
that to show you what that looks like up
close<00:04:44.389> unfortunately<00:04:45.389> I'm<00:04:45.570> not<00:04:45.630> sure<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.350> my

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
close unfortunately I'm not sure of my

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.439 
close unfortunately I'm not sure of my
focal<00:04:46.949> points<00:04:47.280> on<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.759> think<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.150> was<00:04:48.270> the

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
focal points on this I think it was the

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.330 
focal points on this I think it was the
sign<00:04:48.690> I'm<00:04:48.960> pretty<00:04:49.229> sure<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.500> was<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.770> sign<00:04:49.979> but

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
sign I'm pretty sure it was the sign but

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.439 
sign I'm pretty sure it was the sign but
that's<00:04:51.120> what<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.360> looks<00:04:51.570> like<00:04:51.750> up<00:04:51.930> close<00:04:53.449> and

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
that's what that looks like up close and

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.629 
that's what that looks like up close and
this<00:04:54.900> lens<00:04:55.139> does<00:04:55.380> not<00:04:55.800> have<00:04:56.070> macro

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
this lens does not have macro

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.180 
this lens does not have macro
capabilities<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.380> can<00:04:58.560> get<00:04:58.740> up<00:04:58.770> pretty

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
capabilities but you can get up pretty

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.900 
capabilities but you can get up pretty
close<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.639> think<00:04:59.669> it's<00:05:00.139> 1.3<00:05:01.139> feet<00:05:01.560> as<00:05:02.460> the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
close I think it's 1.3 feet as the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.760 
close I think it's 1.3 feet as the
closest<00:05:04.580> distance<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:06.000> can<00:05:06.120> focus<00:05:06.360> at<00:05:06.770> this

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
closest distance you can focus at this

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.110 
closest distance you can focus at this
one<00:05:08.039> obviously<00:05:09.050> contrast<00:05:10.050> blacks<00:05:10.680> and

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
one obviously contrast blacks and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.240 
one obviously contrast blacks and
brightness<00:05:12.120> played<00:05:12.419> with<00:05:12.770> but<00:05:13.770> let<00:05:13.949> me<00:05:14.039> crop

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
brightness played with but let me crop

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.010 
brightness played with but let me crop
that<00:05:14.430> in<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:14.699> we<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.880> see<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.210> sharpness<00:05:15.599> I

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
that in so we can see the sharpness I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.420 
that in so we can see the sharpness I
don't<00:05:16.199> think<00:05:16.349> I've<00:05:16.440> laid<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.800> sharpness<00:05:17.099> by

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
don't think I've laid the sharpness by

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.189 
don't think I've laid the sharpness by
the<00:05:17.490> way<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:19.020> there's<00:05:19.229> that<00:05:19.440> up<00:05:19.650> close<00:05:21.199> pretty

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
the way so there's that up close pretty

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.360 
the way so there's that up close pretty
pretty<00:05:22.889> sharp<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.430> mean<00:05:24.560> it's<00:05:25.560> pretty<00:05:25.830> close<00:05:26.099> to

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
pretty sharp I mean it's pretty close to

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.060 
pretty sharp I mean it's pretty close to
what<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.030> get<00:05:27.270> on<00:05:27.449> an<00:05:28.050> L<00:05:28.199> lens<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.830> mean<00:05:31.039> let<00:05:32.039> me

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
what you get on an L lens I mean let me

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.170 
what you get on an L lens I mean let me
do<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.639> couple<00:05:32.880> more<00:05:33.300> here<00:05:33.810> on<00:05:34.639> so<00:05:35.639> again

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
do just a couple more here on so again

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.760 
do just a couple more here on so again
to<00:05:36.389> give<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.690> an<00:05:36.810> idea<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.260> range

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
to give you an idea of the range

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:48.909 
to give you an idea of the range
let<00:05:38.400> me<00:05:38.520> crop<00:05:38.760> this<00:05:38.970> one<00:05:39.180> in

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.600 

this<00:05:49.250> mainly<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.910> give<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.180> an<00:05:50.330> idea<00:05:50.449> of<00:05:51.610> what

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
this mainly to give you an idea of what

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.490 
this mainly to give you an idea of what
people<00:05:52.639> look<00:05:53.090> like<00:05:53.120> in<00:05:53.599> the<00:05:53.810> vocal<00:05:54.080> range<00:05:54.319> of

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
people look like in the vocal range of

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.980 
people look like in the vocal range of
this<00:05:54.680> lens<00:05:54.979> you<00:05:55.310> can<00:05:55.940> shoot<00:05:56.300> people<00:05:56.360> with<00:05:56.810> it

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
this lens you can shoot people with it

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.930 
this lens you can shoot people with it
definitely<00:05:57.770> not<00:05:57.919> large<00:05:58.250> groups<00:05:58.669> you're<00:05:58.849> gonna

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
definitely not large groups you're gonna

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.400 
definitely not large groups you're gonna
have<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.210> back<00:05:59.389> up<00:05:59.599> quite<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.930> bit

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
have to back up quite a bit

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.610 
have to back up quite a bit
but<00:06:00.830> it's<00:06:00.949> a<00:06:01.039> nice<00:06:01.280> lens<00:06:01.639> for<00:06:02.210> some<00:06:02.620> shallow

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
but it's a nice lens for some shallow

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.409 
but it's a nice lens for some shallow
depth-of-field<00:06:04.130> get<00:06:04.849> a<00:06:04.880> nice<00:06:05.090> blurred

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
depth-of-field get a nice blurred

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.600 
depth-of-field get a nice blurred
background<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:06.110> know<00:06:06.259> and<00:06:06.889> that<00:06:07.460> always

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
background you know and that always

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.300 
background you know and that always
looks<00:06:07.910> good<00:06:08.090> with<00:06:08.509> people<00:06:08.720> so<00:06:09.110> it's<00:06:09.830> it's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
looks good with people so it's it's

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.159 
looks good with people so it's it's
decent<00:06:10.880> it's<00:06:11.060> definitely<00:06:11.720> not<00:06:11.870> a<00:06:11.930> good

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
decent it's definitely not a good

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.850 
decent it's definitely not a good
walk-around<00:06:12.740> lens<00:06:12.979> though<00:06:13.270> just<00:06:14.270> because<00:06:14.860> the

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
walk-around lens though just because the

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.909 
walk-around lens though just because the
focal<00:06:16.250> range<00:06:16.400> isn't<00:06:17.199> isn't<00:06:18.199> that<00:06:18.440> flexible

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
focal range isn't isn't that flexible

you want to you want to get a nice
shallow<00:06:31.430> depth<00:06:31.759> of<00:06:31.880> field<00:06:31.940> you<00:06:32.389> know<00:06:32.509> it<00:06:32.630> has

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
shallow depth of field you know it has

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.770 
shallow depth of field you know it has
that<00:06:32.810> wide<00:06:33.229> open<00:06:33.819> 1.8<00:06:35.229> aperture<00:06:36.229> so<00:06:36.560> um<00:06:37.630> it's<00:06:38.630> a

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
that wide open 1.8 aperture so um it's a

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.700 
that wide open 1.8 aperture so um it's a
super<00:06:39.349> sharp<00:06:39.650> lens<00:06:39.949> uh<00:06:40.520> the<00:06:41.210> the<00:06:41.630> CA<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.289> pretty

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
super sharp lens uh the the CA is pretty

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.300 
super sharp lens uh the the CA is pretty
bad<00:06:42.889> on<00:06:43.130> it<00:06:43.280> I've<00:06:43.490> even<00:06:43.789> noticed<00:06:43.940> it<00:06:44.270> on<00:06:45.310> just

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
bad on it I've even noticed it on just

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.300 
bad on it I've even noticed it on just
like<00:06:46.490> full<00:06:46.849> screen<00:06:47.240> no<00:06:47.569> crop<00:06:48.099> sometimes<00:06:49.099> I've

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
like full screen no crop sometimes I've

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.360 
like full screen no crop sometimes I've
noticed<00:06:49.699> the<00:06:49.909> the<00:06:49.940> CA<00:06:50.389> on<00:06:50.720> it<00:06:50.900> but<00:06:51.380> um<00:06:51.710> that's

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
noticed the the CA on it but um that's

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.920 
noticed the the CA on it but um that's
something<00:06:52.490> you<00:06:52.789> can<00:06:52.940> get<00:06:53.060> around<00:06:53.360> you<00:06:53.690> know<00:06:53.780> it

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
something you can get around you know it

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.180 
something you can get around you know it
can<00:06:54.259> be<00:06:54.289> corrected

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
can be corrected

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.719 
can be corrected
you<00:06:55.580> can<00:06:56.650> stop<00:06:57.650> down<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:58.009> aperture<00:06:58.280> a<00:06:58.460> little

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
you can stop down the aperture a little

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.050 
you can stop down the aperture a little
bit<00:06:58.849> to<00:06:59.090> uh<00:06:59.469> help<00:07:00.469> out<00:07:00.590> with<00:07:00.740> that<00:07:00.919> but<00:07:01.490> it's<00:07:01.969> a

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
bit to uh help out with that but it's a

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.020 
bit to uh help out with that but it's a
super<00:07:02.389> sharp<00:07:02.630> lens<00:07:04.240> it's<00:07:05.240> cheap<00:07:05.690> it<00:07:06.820> the<00:07:07.820> build

super sharp lens it's cheap it the build
quality<00:07:08.210> isn't<00:07:08.690> that<00:07:08.900> great<00:07:09.229> but<00:07:09.860> overall

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520
