block<00:01:46.280> okay<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.340> another<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
block okay so another thing that I see a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
block okay so another thing that I see a
lot<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.960> servers<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.799> probably<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> do

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
lot of servers are probably going to do

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.539 
lot of servers are probably going to do
is<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:52.140> sort<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> command<00:01:53.130> center<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
is that sort of a command center to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.179 
is that sort of a command center to
their<00:01:54.060> map<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.530> able<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.890> do

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
their map now this would be able to do

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.050 
their map now this would be able to do
many<00:01:56.850> commands<00:01:57.390> such<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.070> toggle<00:01:59.070> day<00:01:59.640> or

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
many commands such as toggle day or

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.530 
many commands such as toggle day or
night<00:02:00.680> we<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:01.979> add<00:02:02.430> more<00:02:02.880> advanced

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
night we can also add more advanced

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.410 
night we can also add more advanced
options<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.369> teleportation<00:02:05.850> command

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
options with the teleportation command

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.830 
options with the teleportation command
and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
and
this<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.530> very<00:02:07.799> useful<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:11.519> can<00:02:11.670> also

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this is very very useful you can also

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.800 
this is very very useful you can also
add<00:02:12.269> time<00:02:13.069> with<00:02:14.069> time<00:02:14.459> add<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.209> lot<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.510> people

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
add time with time add a lot of people

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.410 
add time with time add a lot of people
don't<00:02:15.989> know<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.370> add<00:02:17.670> 1000<00:02:18.330> is

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
don't know that but that add 1000 is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960 
don't know that but that add 1000 is
pretty<00:02:18.690> useful<00:02:18.870> because<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.400> set<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> time

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
pretty useful because if we set the time

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.570 
pretty useful because if we set the time
tonight<00:02:21.629> as<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.349> see<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> sky<00:02:23.099> still

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
tonight as you can see the sky still

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.580 
tonight as you can see the sky still
isn't<00:02:23.940> black<00:02:24.299> it's<00:02:24.599> not<00:02:24.780> really<00:02:25.140> nighttime

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
isn't black it's not really nighttime

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.059 
isn't black it's not really nighttime
but<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.819> add<00:02:27.110> 1000<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.860> will

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
but we can just add 1000 and it will

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.039 
but we can just add 1000 and it will
pretty<00:02:29.489> much<00:02:29.580> make<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.090> black<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> also

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
pretty much make it black you can also

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.229 
pretty much make it black you can also
add<00:02:31.379> 5,000<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.430> 10,000<00:02:33.090> OOP<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.790> also<00:02:35.940> have

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
add 5,000 or 10,000 OOP and we also have

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.800 
add 5,000 or 10,000 OOP and we also have
the<00:02:36.420> initial<00:02:36.810> set<00:02:37.530> time<00:02:37.739> today<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.630> set<00:02:39.630> time

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the initial set time today and set time

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.350 
the initial set time today and set time
tonight<00:02:40.290> commands<00:02:41.190> let's<00:02:41.849> go<00:02:42.000> back<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.299> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
tonight commands let's go back to the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.650 
tonight commands let's go back to the
command<00:02:42.599> center<00:02:43.970> another<00:02:44.970> thing<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.480> do

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
command center another thing you can do

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.250 
command center another thing you can do
is<00:02:45.930> toggle<00:02:46.470> rain<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.489> snow<00:02:47.959> currently<00:02:48.959> raining

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
is toggle rain or snow currently raining

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.449 
is toggle rain or snow currently raining
so<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.190> actually<00:02:50.549> does<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> opposite<00:02:51.379> as

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
so it's it actually does the opposite as

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.809 
so it's it actually does the opposite as
the<00:02:53.459> light<00:02:53.790> says<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.049> okay<00:02:55.579> this<00:02:56.579> one

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the light says but that's okay this one

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.970 
the light says but that's okay this one
is<00:02:56.849> probably<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:59.640> most<00:02:59.879> useful<00:03:00.590> thing<00:03:01.590> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
is probably the most useful thing that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.180 
is probably the most useful thing that
we<00:03:02.160> would<00:03:02.370> use<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.500> command<00:03:04.500> center<00:03:04.590> because

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
we would use in a command center because

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.970 
we would use in a command center because
you<00:03:05.519> can't<00:03:05.730> actually<00:03:06.110> change<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.260> difficulty

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you can't actually change the difficulty

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.780 
you can't actually change the difficulty
in<00:03:08.599> a<00:03:09.599> server<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.220> would<00:03:11.400> allow<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
in a server so this would allow you to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.270 
in a server so this would allow you to
do<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.120> mean<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.569> will<00:03:13.500> probably<00:03:13.950> add<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
do that I mean it will probably add the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.699 
do that I mean it will probably add the
command<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.790> server's<00:03:15.209> soon<00:03:16.109> but<00:03:16.500> right

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
command to the server's soon but right

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.129 
command to the server's soon but right
now<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.370> can't<00:03:17.609> do<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.900> edit

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
now you can't do that you have to edit

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.580 
now you can't do that you have to edit
the<00:03:19.560> note<00:03:19.799> add<00:03:20.069> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> server<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> another

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the note add in the server so another

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.970 
the note add in the server so another
thing<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.609> spam<00:03:24.380> so<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.709> set

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
thing you can do is spam so we can set

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.039 
thing you can do is spam so we can set
the<00:03:26.130> spam<00:03:26.459> message<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.150> anything<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.900> can

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the spam message to anything and you can

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.259 
the spam message to anything and you can
also<00:03:28.170> use<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> secondary<00:03:28.950> one<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.519> if<00:03:29.639> we<00:03:29.790> just

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
also use a secondary one so if we just

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.160 
also use a secondary one so if we just
do<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:31.470> will<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.459> continuously<00:03:33.209> span

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
do one it will just continuously span

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.250 
do one it will just continuously span
the<00:03:34.380> server<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:35.489> also<00:03:35.840> put<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> secondary

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
the server can also put a secondary

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.990 
the server can also put a secondary
moments<00:03:37.769> will<00:03:37.980> make<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.250> good<00:03:38.370> twice<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.819> fast

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
moments will make it good twice as fast

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.839 
moments will make it good twice as fast
but<00:03:40.400> let's<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.459> do<00:03:41.730> something<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:42.299> gray<00:03:42.810> is

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
but let's just do something like gray is

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:52.009 
but let's just do something like gray is
sexay<00:03:44.849> got<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.900> put<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.430> there<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:50.870> there<00:03:51.870> we

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
sexay got to put the a there so there we

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.960 
sexay got to put the a there so there we
go<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.500> will<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.680> continuously<00:03:53.579> tell<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
go it will just continuously tell the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.550 
go it will just continuously tell the
server<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.599> gray<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.139> sexay<00:03:55.739> here<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:56.760> go

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
server that gray is sexay here you go

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.909 
server that gray is sexay here you go
can<00:03:58.560> also<00:03:58.680> send<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.130> gift<00:03:59.370> someone<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.919> we'll

useful can also send XP to everyone now
I'm<00:04:14.820> not<00:04:15.090> sure<00:04:15.120> why<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.690> ever<00:04:15.810> do<00:04:16.110> this

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
I'm not sure why you would ever do this

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.030 
I'm not sure why you would ever do this
but<00:04:16.650> there<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.640> go<00:04:17.700> oh<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.930> level<00:04:19.200> 108<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:20.070> 200

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
but there you go oh the level 108 of 200

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.370 
but there you go oh the level 108 of 200
kill<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.810> it's<00:04:24.810> pretty<00:04:25.050> self-explanatory

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
kill all it's pretty self-explanatory

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.490

press it boom bunny I just I don't see
how<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.790> can<00:04:42.000> get<00:04:42.150> more<00:04:42.300> useful<00:04:42.660> than<00:04:42.690> this

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
how you can get more useful than this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
now believe it or not I think that the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.680 
now believe it or not I think that the
most<00:04:46.320> used<00:04:47.130> command<00:04:47.640> or<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.090> will<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.510> the

most used command or that will be the
most<00:04:48.870> used<00:04:49.170> command<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:50.370> sake<00:04:50.730> man<00:04:51.060> and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
most used command is the sake man and

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.540 
most used command is the sake man and
the<00:04:52.050> reason<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.800> because<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:53.340> can

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
the reason is is because you can

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.130 
the reason is is because you can
actually<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.480> as<00:04:54.720> on-screen<00:04:55.380> GUI<00:04:55.940> for

yin Percy notch an alert now the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.260 
yin Percy notch an alert now the
question<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.660> what<00:05:10.320> is<00:05:10.410> not<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:10.800> real<00:05:10.980> name

de<00:05:45.870> cette<00:05:46.200> heure<00:05:46.230> now<00:05:46.890> essentially<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:48.240> way

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
de cette heure now essentially the way

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.070 
de cette heure now essentially the way
this<00:05:48.570> works<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.230> villager<00:05:50.600> stays<00:05:51.600> outside

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
this works is a villager stays outside

this works is a villager stays outside
when<00:05:52.380> it<00:05:52.470> is<00:05:52.590> day<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.040> he<00:05:53.160> goes<00:05:53.340> inside<00:05:53.820> when

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
when it is day and he goes inside when

when it is day and he goes inside when
it<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.360> nighttime<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:55.020> if<00:05:55.110> we<00:05:55.260> go<00:05:55.680> to<00:05:55.740> time<00:05:56.100> set

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
it is nighttime so if we go to time set

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.290 
it is nighttime so if we go to time set
night<00:05:57.600> in<00:05:58.230> a<00:05:58.620> few<00:05:58.800> seconds<00:05:59.190> here<00:05:59.490> he<00:05:59.880> will<00:06:00.060> go

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
night in a few seconds here he will go

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.090 
night in a few seconds here he will go
inside<00:06:00.690> so<00:06:01.140> let's<00:06:01.500> just<00:06:01.710> wait<00:06:01.890> for<00:06:02.070> him<00:06:02.130> a

shortly so another thing you can make is
this<00:06:21.439> evil<00:06:21.919> contraption<00:06:22.639> which<00:06:23.360> I'll<00:06:23.930> just

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
this evil contraption which I'll just

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.119 
this evil contraption which I'll just
show<00:06:24.439> you<00:06:24.469> what<00:06:24.740> it<00:06:24.830> does<00:06:25.930> it's<00:06:26.930> a<00:06:27.319> complete

show you what it does it's a complete
spam<00:06:28.729> machine<00:06:29.270> is<00:06:29.539> very<00:06:29.990> very<00:06:30.229> horrifying<00:06:30.819> so

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
spam machine is very very horrifying so

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.369 
spam machine is very very horrifying so
the<00:06:32.000> entire<00:06:32.180> server<00:06:32.509> is<00:06:32.689> going<00:06:32.900> to<00:06:33.020> see<00:06:33.199> this

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379 
the entire server is going to see this

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:35.529 
the entire server is going to see this
in<00:06:33.680> their<00:06:33.889> chat<00:06:34.400> and<00:06:34.699> they're<00:06:35.120> pretty<00:06:35.270> much

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
in their chat and they're pretty much

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.409 
in their chat and they're pretty much
screwed<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:36.370> there<00:06:37.370> you<00:06:37.460> go<00:06:37.520> this<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.300> you

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
screwed so there you go this and you

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.999 
screwed so there you go this and you
can't<00:06:38.599> even<00:06:38.719> turn<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.080> off<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.560> only<00:06:39.740> way<00:06:39.830> turn

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
can't even turn it off the only way turn

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.080 
can't even turn it off the only way turn
it<00:06:40.129> off<00:06:40.250> is<00:06:40.430> by<00:06:40.550> hitting<00:06:40.909> the<00:06:42.669> these<00:06:43.669> so

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
it off is by hitting the these so

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.129 
it off is by hitting the these so
they're<00:06:44.690> here<00:06:45.139> now<00:06:45.729> this<00:06:46.729> is<00:06:46.909> the<00:06:47.270> last<00:06:47.840> one

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
they're here now this is the last one

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.459 
they're here now this is the last one
and<00:06:48.379> it's<00:06:48.919> basically<00:06:49.190> an<00:06:49.729> elevator<00:06:50.330> system<00:06:51.020> so

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
and it's basically an elevator system so

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.439 
and it's basically an elevator system so
the<00:06:51.770> way<00:06:51.889> it<00:06:51.919> works<00:06:52.039> is<00:06:52.550> you<00:06:52.580> press<00:06:52.819> button<00:06:53.240> and

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
the way it works is you press button and

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.520 
the way it works is you press button and
it<00:06:54.050> will<00:06:54.080> go<00:06:54.530> to<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:54.680> command<00:06:55.039> block<00:06:56.319> that<00:06:57.319> has

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
it will go to a command block that has

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.029 
it will go to a command block that has
the<00:06:58.280> teleportation<00:06:58.759> command<00:06:59.360> in<00:07:00.139> it<00:07:00.289> so<00:07:00.889> if<00:07:00.949> we

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
the teleportation command in it so if we

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.890 
the teleportation command in it so if we
want<00:07:01.159> to<00:07:01.250> go<00:07:01.370> up<00:07:01.550> to<00:07:01.789> compress<00:07:02.300> this<00:07:02.449> button

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
want to go up to compress this button

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.830 
want to go up to compress this button
and<00:07:03.020> we<00:07:03.650> are<00:07:03.740> on<00:07:03.919> the<00:07:04.039> top<00:07:04.190> floor<00:07:04.509> we<00:07:05.509> can<00:07:05.690> then

and we are on the top floor we can then

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.679 
and we are on the top floor we can then
go<00:07:06.020> down<00:07:06.229> back<00:07:06.529> to<00:07:06.560> the<00:07:06.740> bottom<00:07:07.210> we<00:07:08.210> can<00:07:08.360> go<00:07:08.449> up

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:08.689 
go down back to the bottom we can go up

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.269 
go down back to the bottom we can go up
down<00:07:09.580> down<00:07:10.580> one<00:07:10.789> and<00:07:10.969> we'll<00:07:11.930> be<00:07:12.139> on<00:07:12.439> the<00:07:12.860> middle

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.279 
down down one and we'll be on the middle

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.119 
down down one and we'll be on the middle
floor<00:07:13.819> so<00:07:14.569> you<00:07:15.169> know<00:07:15.289> you<00:07:15.349> can<00:07:15.469> connect<00:07:15.979> these

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:16.129 
floor so you know you can connect these

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.920 
floor so you know you can connect these
two<00:07:16.400> maybe<00:07:16.610> farms<00:07:17.120> or<00:07:17.240> something<00:07:17.629> so<00:07:17.900> you

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
would be able to go to each farm very

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.640 
would be able to go to each farm very
very<00:07:21.319> easily<00:07:21.529> so<00:07:21.969> there<00:07:22.969> if<00:07:23.840> you've<00:07:24.409> made<00:07:24.590> it
