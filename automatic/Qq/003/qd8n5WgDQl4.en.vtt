00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.550
 who has big family nowadays stays 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 restricted when buying a car does not 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.040
 really 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.559
 There are even some options but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.650
 few is a niche that comes from 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.090
 but much of the Chinese grew the jac 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.880
 I look at this market 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.260
 besides the j6 they now offer another 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 model capable of carrying seven people very 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 space comfort versatility good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 finish and a reasonable price 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 this is the proposal of the already has eight 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 both the transportation of executives and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.809
 for large families 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.239
 a good balcony of the Chinese to supply 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.149
 the segment that lies between the utilities 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.280
 sports cars and the big vans 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.360
 when it comes to transporting seven 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 passengers 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 the design is a work of art but it calls 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 the attention and denunciation that comes with 3 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.420
 meters and eight centimeters away 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 between axes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.609
 all space was thought and well being 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 occupants with all banks in the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.630
 place is still over one thousand three hundred and ten 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 liters of luggage space in the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.640
 Reasonable trunk a good differential 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.340
 when comparing the competitors of the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.090
 type that offers far less room for 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 back 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 Another highlight of your 8 is the evolution of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 internal finishing with the materials 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.580
 correct pitches and showy panel 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.189
 composes in an inner positive way 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.470
 including with regard to 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.100
 equipment such as front seats 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 electric heating with air sunroof 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 independently controlled 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.170
 to the rear camera . 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 rear parking and central sensors 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.189
 multimedia speakerphone only needs to be 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 gps one of the cheap are the middle banks 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.960
 who saw 360 degrees 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 the bug is that you can only use those 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.439
 way with the car to op because teaching 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.439
 does not accompany 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.420
 fits another ball out is the rear seat 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.660
 for three occupants that is one- piece 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.490
 could serve as a party, which would 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.530
 bank versatility 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.350
 anyway all banks 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.570
 can be withdrawn by transforming into the river 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.350
 big furg 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:32.090
 the engine is 2.0 turbo enough to 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:34.250
 give a good performance up to 8 following good 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.350
 power and maximum torque 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.930
 constant between two thousand and four thousand 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.040
 rotations has already allowed us to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.130
 resourcefulness 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.130
 the six-speed manual gearbox with 11 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.080
 couplings cooperates with this result but 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.010
 type of vehicle is owed an exchange rate 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.230
 automatic 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.690
 another point in favor of your 8 is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.580
 suspension and has a good compromise between 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.580
 comfort and stability 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 What they want? 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.660
 already being sold and costs 114 thousand 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 nine hundred and ninety reais 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.610
 the only option is a padding in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.830
 leather that costs another 2 thousand 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.410
 but here among us the investment to be 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.410
 done because it leaves the interior well mash
