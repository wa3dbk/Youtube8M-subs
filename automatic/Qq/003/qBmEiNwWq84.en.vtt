the<00:02:20.110> funniest<00:02:20.230> thing<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> actually

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310

showed<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.920> her<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.700> was<00:02:24.820> kind<00:02:25.000> of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
showed it to her so that was kind of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.750 
showed it to her so that was kind of
funny<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.260> brush<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.470> out<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:27.100> really

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
funny but you can brush it out I really

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
funny but you can brush it out I really
I<00:02:27.790> know<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:28.660> curl<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.320> little<00:02:29.470> bit<00:02:29.680> but

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
I know you can curl it a little bit but

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.710 
I know you can curl it a little bit but
I<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.220> didn't<00:02:30.400> want<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.610> mess<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.450> I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
I really didn't want to mess it up so I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.140 
I really didn't want to mess it up so I
just<00:02:32.350> left<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.890> way<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.100> was<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:34.060> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
just left it the way it was and then I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.430 
just left it the way it was and then I
just<00:02:34.209> put<00:02:34.390> my<00:02:34.600> hair<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> little<00:02:35.140> bun<00:02:35.290> or

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
just put my hair in a little bun or

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.650 
just put my hair in a little bun or
whatever<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.120> clip<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.450> on

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
whatever and then you just clip it on

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.340 
whatever and then you just clip it on
and<00:02:38.230> shove<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.170> hopefully<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.230> looks

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
and shove it in and hopefully it looks

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.350 
and shove it in and hopefully it looks
alright<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.670> pop

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
alright and that's it so that is the pop

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.449 
alright and that's it so that is the pop
spiky<00:02:47.200> clip<00:02:47.760> $10<00:02:48.760> pretty<00:02:49.510> reasonable<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
spiky clip $10 pretty reasonable and

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.120 
spiky clip $10 pretty reasonable and
even<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> clip<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.810> strong<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.650> that's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
even the clip is strong so that that's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.830 
even the clip is strong so that that's
going<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.580> probably<00:02:54.850> last<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.270> long<00:02:55.390> time<00:02:55.450> I've
