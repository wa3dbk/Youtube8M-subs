 house to do the format work we 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.500
 we take on average more than two hours 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.180
 doing it because it was somewhat difficult and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.640
 As we did not find anything else to do 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.680
 we started to watch scary videos very 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 false we get bored and my 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.090
 friend Juan Carlos confessed something to us 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.040
 this had been told of the notebook 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 a series of anime that I bought myself in a 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.340
 comic book asked and everyone 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.230
 We said yes for fun 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.210
 I wrote several names of people 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.520
 including you and me and several 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.470
 classroom teachers hehehe in case not 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.570
 they knew the series is about a young man who 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 find a notebook and if you write the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.050
 name of a person and how he will die 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.420
 it will pass in the time that your scribes 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.730
 we all look at him and Juan 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.650
 He kept talking because he wanted to 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.020
 burn it because when I go to sleep 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.690
 I keep it under my bed and I dream of 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.420
 horrible deaths I told him I was 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.820
 well and if I wanted to, I did 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.950
 the matches and Juan the alcohol rodrigo 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.720
 a bag and fausto the notebook of something 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 that when opening it on the cover it appeared 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.530
 a half transparent sheet with a 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.450
 heart with wings and behind that leaf 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.820
 another black sheet with a skull 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
 contained about 20 rule sheets and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.220
 then 50 blank to write there 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.200
 the names we soak in alcohol myself 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 I was removing his head from the matches 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.830
 and put them leaf by leaf inside the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.140
 booklet until the time came 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 of the show I made a cross with the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 alcohol 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 I lit a match and threw it at 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.290
 notebook when I play it came out a big 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.930
 green flare we all backed off 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.090
 terrified I started reciting a few 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.070
 prayers and in the fire they appeared 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.920
 small swirls in the corners of the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.990
 notebook when the fire was consumed 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.850
 two leaves were left without burning one was 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.800
 that of the skull another contained the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.070
 names of some roommates 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.990
 together with some teachers we are scared 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.000
 and we returned to burn after 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.300
 set it on fire three times at last 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.860
 reduced the damn notebook to ashes 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.230
 we were about to cross the door of 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.690
 exit when a black sheet slipped 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.090
 under our feet when I took it I felt 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.709
 We read a great chill and it turned out 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.830
 be one of the rules that narrated what 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.810
 following rule 15 the notebook should not 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.730
 be destroyed otherwise the owner 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 will die along with the people whom 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.980
 their names will be found in it 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.690
 we surprised to the point of frightening us but 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.720
 we try not to give importance and 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.000
 we left his house around 8 in 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.130
 point I arrived at my house I greeted my mom 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.930
 and I took a bath because of the smell of ash 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.969
 that my clothes said 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.790
 In my room I read until midnight 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.379
 I kept my book and fell asleep 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 I woke up and suddenly I started to feel 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.879
 that my squeezed the heart I felt how 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.799
 started to stop beating I tried 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.870
 get up but it was one what I did 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.790
 I screamed but no sound came out of me 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.430
 mouth and finally the fucking notebook and I 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.349
 I had consumed the truth I do not know how much 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.239
 time has passed and I 'm still here 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.340
 sunk in the gloom along with more 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.620
 from the middle of my room I hope that they 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.230
 have liked to subscribe be commented and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.680

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.680
 next
