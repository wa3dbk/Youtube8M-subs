00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 well, well, what did you do to the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 Aztec stadium because it touched us this I am going to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 interview the fans of cougars and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450
 well we ask the most obvious not that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.059
 he always knew his emblematic power 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.660
 but what is goya that is a goya that was 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660
 what they answered 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.850
 to the university song 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.410
 when you do 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.030
 many obvious things from the teams by 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.590
 example what are your favorite idols 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.059
 by hugo sánchez sanchez 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.059
 because he betrayed us with the chickens 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.900
 Then Sanchez Hugo Sanchez gave him the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.010
 championships to the cougars as a coach 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.010
 because he did not do that anymore 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.879
 hugo sanchez son you know because 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.790
 The cougar porra shouts goya is a 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.030
 trick from the heart in coia then 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.030
 University 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.939
 it's something a lot inside the unam 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.560
 Well, that's the name of the mascot 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.450
 the cougars 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.710
 but there is no equal encouragement support 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.259
 for the team the mouth is like Mexicans 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.259
 to the war cry libertarians get ready 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.259
 it's cock time 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:42.350
 all areas are handsome or you know in 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.350
 this case I do not know I redid you forgive 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.280
 because they are going to meet like a sea 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.620
 everything more good when the university 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.290
 They were going somewhere but it was called 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.690
 goya or something like that and that's where the test came from 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.930
 there they will be hot hot but 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:14.180
 it was already a tradition to leave as 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.720
 it looks like it was a cinema of all since it is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:28.480
 a little closet 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:28.480
 but when the university students went 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.840
 remote viewing 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.520
 since he was in the university neighborhood 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.350
 then they started shouting goya goya and 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.730
 that meant we were leaving 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.730
 precisely duffard 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 if you remember some I can not say 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.160
 that the television show 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.030
 to put a joke when the American 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.670
 the one that talked more about stick 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.020
 amateur times I was in class and low 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.610
 because of a very famous cinema in the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.610
 center that was called goya cinema 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.829
 we have to recognize that the hobby of 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.780
 Cougars are the ones that have known most 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.340
 everyone we have interviewed and the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.629
 the vast majority had the answer 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.269
 correct some think it was a bar 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.030
 others that is a cinema but good you 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.870
 I should leave the luster but good 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.049
 cinema of the mid -40s was 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.389
 explain that the chub a rare canchón 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.340
 now little is invited to the 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.920
 girls because the university was 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.709
 in the center of the city and then the 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.810
 goya to enter the cinema already involves the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.310
 family to female students and the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.230
