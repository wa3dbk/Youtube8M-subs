hollow<00:04:53.840> out<00:04:53.930> all<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.260> pressure<00:04:54.470> points<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
hollow out all the pressure points and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.610 
hollow out all the pressure points and
it's<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.120> nice<00:04:56.300> density<00:04:56.750> so<00:04:57.110> you're<00:04:57.260> not<00:04:57.350> losing

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
it's a nice density so you're not losing

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.490 
it's a nice density so you're not losing
that<00:04:57.850> help<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.940> efficiency<00:04:59.449> it's<00:05:00.169> also<00:05:00.380> a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
that help of efficiency it's also a

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.210 
that help of efficiency it's also a
quick<00:05:00.770> dry<00:05:00.949> pad<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.460> we<00:05:01.660> run<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> higher<00:05:03.220> foam

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
quick dry pad so we run a higher foam

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.400 
quick dry pad so we run a higher foam
cells<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.699> basically<00:05:05.120> when<00:05:05.449> you<00:05:05.539> sweat<00:05:05.840> or<00:05:06.380> if

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
cells so basically when you sweat or if

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.469

short and along with the softshell pant
version<00:06:15.470> of<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.650> is<00:06:15.800> pockets<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.300> pockets

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
version of it is pockets so the pockets

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.620 
version of it is pockets so the pockets
do<00:06:17.810> not<00:06:17.960> go<00:06:18.199> to<00:06:18.260> the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
do not go to the

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.180 
do not go to the
if<00:06:19.170> they<00:06:19.350> were<00:06:19.410> in<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> front<00:06:19.830> they<00:06:20.100> did

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
if they were in the front they did

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.680 
if they were in the front they did
interfere<00:06:20.370> with<00:06:20.610> that<00:06:20.790> flex<00:06:21.180> zone<00:06:21.450> of<00:06:21.660> the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
interfere with that flex zone of the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.350 
interfere with that flex zone of the
pedal<00:06:22.380> stroke<00:06:22.560> in<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.550> back<00:06:23.700> those<00:06:23.940> pockets

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
pedal stroke in the back those pockets

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.230 
pedal stroke in the back those pockets
actually<00:06:24.720> /<00:06:25.080> back<00:06:25.380> at<00:06:25.620> an<00:06:25.740> angle<00:06:26.070> and<00:06:26.220> dip<00:06:27.030> down

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
actually / back at an angle and dip down

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.270 
actually / back at an angle and dip down
so<00:06:27.990> they're<00:06:28.110> out<00:06:28.260> of<00:06:28.290> that<00:06:28.530> sits<00:06:28.830> on<00:06:29.010> if<00:06:29.190> you
