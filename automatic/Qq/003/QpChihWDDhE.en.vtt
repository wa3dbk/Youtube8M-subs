00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.720 

all<00:00:01.050> right<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.560> let's<00:00:01.740> talk<00:00:01.920> about<00:00:01.979> model

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
all right so let's talk about model

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.210 
all right so let's talk about model
organization<00:00:03.540> so<00:00:03.899> we've<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.830> put<00:00:05.100> together

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
organization so we've we've put together

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.970 
organization so we've we've put together
all<00:00:05.580> these<00:00:05.730> things<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.390> our<00:00:06.750> groups<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.350> now

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
all these things in our groups and now

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.370 
all these things in our groups and now
we<00:00:08.040> need<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.460> start<00:00:08.670> using<00:00:08.820> layers<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
we need to start using layers and the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
we need to start using layers and the
good<00:00:10.530> news<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.040> I've<00:00:11.429> developed<00:00:11.759> an

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
good news is that I've developed an

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.060 
good news is that I've developed an
entire<00:00:12.330> system<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> layering<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.740> Sketchup

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
entire system of layering and Sketchup

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.580 
entire system of layering and Sketchup
layering<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> model<00:00:15.690> organization<00:00:15.960> that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
layering and model organization that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.290 
layering and model organization that
really<00:00:16.770> all<00:00:17.039> works<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> template<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
really all works with the template and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470 
really all works with the template and
and<00:00:19.050> again<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> covered<00:00:20.430> 100%<00:00:21.029> my

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and again all of this is covered 100% my

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.150 
and again all of this is covered 100% my
book<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.230> Sketchup<00:00:22.470> workflow<00:00:22.980> for

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
book the Sketchup workflow for

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
book the Sketchup workflow for
architecture<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> look<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.109> our

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
architecture so take a look at our

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
architecture so take a look at our
layers<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.949> architectural<00:00:26.640> layers

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
layers here we have architectural layers

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.140 
layers here we have architectural layers
those<00:00:27.420> are<00:00:27.570> tangible<00:00:27.990> objects<00:00:28.670> walls<00:00:29.670> windows

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
those are tangible objects walls windows

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.500 
those are tangible objects walls windows
doors<00:00:30.619> roof<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.850> conceptual

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
doors roof and then we have conceptual

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
doors roof and then we have conceptual
layers<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.980> those<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
layers as well so those are more like

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.549 
layers as well so those are more like
adjectives<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> describe<00:00:36.809> our

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
adjectives that describe our

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
adjectives that describe our
architectural<00:00:38.129> layers<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.120> into

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
architectural layers and we'll get into

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.720 
architectural layers and we'll get into
that<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.140> site<00:00:40.469> those<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.610> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that and then site those are those are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.950 
that and then site those are those are
similar<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> architectural<00:00:42.750> layers

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
similar to the architectural layers

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.869 
similar to the architectural layers
except<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> tree<00:00:44.309> vault<00:00:44.489> involves<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> sight

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
except a tree vault involves the sight

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.049 
except a tree vault involves the sight
sight<00:00:47.879> entities<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.219> book<00:00:50.399> here's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sight entities so in in the book here's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.250 
sight entities so in in the book here's
a<00:00:51.120> screenshot<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.860> page<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:53.820> book

a screenshot of it or a page in my book

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
a screenshot of it or a page in my book
we<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.649> kinds<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.149> model<00:00:57.149> organization

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we have all kinds of model organization

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.689 
we have all kinds of model organization
diagrams<00:00:58.289> explaining<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> group<00:00:59.430> things

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
diagrams explaining how to group things

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
diagrams explaining how to group things
and<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> layer<00:01:00.660> things<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and how to layer things so not only do I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
and how to layer things so not only do I
have<00:01:02.280> provide<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> layers<00:01:03.270> but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
have provide all of the layers but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070 
have provide all of the layers but
definitely<00:01:04.379> explain<00:01:04.909> completely<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> use

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
definitely explain completely how to use

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.520 
definitely explain completely how to use
those<00:01:07.320> layers<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.830> groups<00:01:09.140> all<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
those layers in groups all right so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.399 
those layers in groups all right so
first<00:01:11.490> thing<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.380> we

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
first thing I like to do and when we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
first thing I like to do and when we
comment<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> default<00:01:15.090> template

default<00:01:22.049> template<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.770> default

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
default template and that default

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
default template and that default
template<00:01:23.520> definitely<00:01:24.060> has<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
template definitely has all of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
template definitely has all of the
utility<00:01:26.670> scenes<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.150> set<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
utility scenes all set up and all of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.920 
utility scenes all set up and all of
your<00:01:28.560> layers<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.090> bunch<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> styles

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
your layers and also a bunch of styles

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
your layers and also a bunch of styles
that<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> need<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that you're going to need to so that's a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
that you're going to need to so that's a
pretty<00:01:33.240> valuable<00:01:33.509> tool<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
pretty valuable tool but what I like to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.789 
pretty valuable tool but what I like to
do<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.720> without<00:01:36.720> getting<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.170> full

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
do is without getting into full

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
do is without getting into full
descriptions<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.729> utility<00:01:39.210> scenes

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
descriptions of all my utility scenes

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.200 
descriptions of all my utility scenes
let's<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> layer<00:01:41.100> state<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.670> off

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
let's just go with a layer state of off

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.260 
let's just go with a layer state of off
so<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> does<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> toggles<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so what that does is it toggles all of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450 
so what that does is it toggles all of
my<00:01:45.450> layers<00:01:45.720> off<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.130> everything's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
my layers off you can see everything's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980 
my layers off you can see everything's
turned<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
turned off right now so that way it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
turned off right now so that way it
makes<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.320> kind<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.979> easy<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.340> me<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> go

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
makes it kind of easy for me to go

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.210 
makes it kind of easy for me to go
through<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.329> layer<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.380> model<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
through and layer my model because as I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.850 
through and layer my model because as I
do<00:01:53.689> each<00:01:54.689> thing<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.409> checked<00:01:55.680> off

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
do each thing is going to be checked off

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.039 
do each thing is going to be checked off
the<00:01:55.890> list<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:59.159> have<00:02:00.049> we're

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the list so what I need is to have we're

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.690 
the list so what I need is to have we're
just<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> our<00:02:01.829> entity<00:02:02.189> info<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
just going to go to our entity info and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
just going to go to our entity info and
we're<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> set<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> roof<00:02:03.920> we're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
we're going to set this to roof we're

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.240 
we're going to set this to roof we're
going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.159> set<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> door<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.950> we're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
going to set the door for now we're

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
going to set the door for now we're
going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.030> doors<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:10.110> we

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
going to put that on doors because we

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.720 
going to put that on doors because we
only<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.500> door

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
only have one door

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.420 
only have one door
or<00:02:11.790> later<00:02:11.970> our<00:02:12.150> windows<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.099> select

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
or later our windows we need to select

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.789 
or later our windows we need to select
all<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.760> those<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.569> critical<00:02:16.080> that

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
all of those and this is critical that

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.699 
all of those and this is critical that
you<00:02:17.099> use<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.610> group<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.810> rather<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.319> applying

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you use a group so rather than applying

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440 
you use a group so rather than applying
a<00:02:19.890> layer<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> each<00:02:20.340> one<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.610> these<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.360> them

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
a layer to each one of these we put them

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.360 
a layer to each one of these we put them
in<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.629> group<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.110> container<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.769> then

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in a group or a container and then

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.119 
in a group or a container and then
assign<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:23.909> layer<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.140> group<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.620> way

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
assign that layer to the group that way

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.210 
assign that layer to the group that way
we<00:02:26.819> don't<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.290> worry<00:02:28.290> about<00:02:28.500> assigning<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
we don't have to worry about assigning a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.940 
we don't have to worry about assigning a
layer<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.640> each<00:02:29.819> into<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.690> individual<00:02:31.349> object

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
layer to each into the individual object

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.369 
layer to each into the individual object
we<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.760> open<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.150> container<00:02:33.510> add<00:02:33.810> some

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
we can just open the container add some

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.410 
we can just open the container add some
windows<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.129> automatically<00:02:36.120> has<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
windows and it automatically has the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.080 
windows and it automatically has the
correct<00:02:36.780> layer<00:02:37.049> applied<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.769> all<00:02:38.700> right<00:02:38.760> so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
correct layer applied to it all right so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.170 
correct layer applied to it all right so
now<00:02:39.239> there's<00:02:40.200> those<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.610> down

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
now there's those and then we have down

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.229 
now there's those and then we have down
low<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.629> have<00:02:42.659> our<00:02:42.930> floors<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.090> we

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
low we have our floors and then here we

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.979 
low we have our floors and then here we
have<00:02:46.160> interior<00:02:47.160> walls<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.879> exterior<00:02:48.780> walls

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
have interior walls and exterior walls

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.380 
have interior walls and exterior walls
so<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.069> need<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.879> take<00:02:51.120> these

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
so what we need to do here is take these

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.890 
so what we need to do here is take these
two<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.989> make<00:02:52.650> them<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:53.069> group<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.780> we're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
two and make them a group and then we're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.039 
two and make them a group and then we're
going<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.049> set<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.950> our<00:02:56.310> walls<00:02:57.049> all

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
going to set this to be on our walls all

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.089 
going to set this to be on our walls all
right<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.319> now<00:02:58.410> let's<00:02:58.620> turn<00:02:58.739> everything<00:02:58.980> back

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
right so now let's turn everything back

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.400 
right so now let's turn everything back
on<00:02:59.430> just<00:03:00.030> click<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.269> all<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.319> our

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
on just click on all on all of our

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.229 
on just click on all on all of our
layers<00:03:01.620> turn<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.310> I'm<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.910> hide<00:03:03.060> my

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
layers turn on and I'm going to hide my

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.780 
layers turn on and I'm going to hide my
roof<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.629> just<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.900> moment<00:03:04.099> this<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.280> where<00:03:05.459> it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
roof for just a moment this is where it

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.670 
roof for just a moment this is where it
gets<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.780> more<00:03:07.079> complex<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.650> have

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
gets a little more complex we have

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.520 
gets a little more complex we have
another<00:03:07.950> level<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.730> organization<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:10.290> we

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
another level of organization because we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.470 
another level of organization because we
want<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.829> differentiate<00:03:11.280> our<00:03:11.670> exterior<00:03:12.239> walls

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
want to differentiate our exterior walls

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.009 
want to differentiate our exterior walls
from<00:03:13.019> our<00:03:13.200> interior<00:03:13.650> walls<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:15.450> group<00:03:15.780> is

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
from our interior walls so this group is

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.259 
from our interior walls so this group is
on<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.680> layer<00:03:16.889> architectural<00:03:17.700> walls<00:03:17.940> and

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
on the layer architectural walls and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.690 
on the layer architectural walls and
when<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> go<00:03:19.109> inside<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.069> I'm<00:03:20.579> going

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
when I go inside of there and I'm going

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.159 
when I go inside of there and I'm going
to<00:03:20.730> hide<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> rest<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.450> my<00:03:21.540> model<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.019> my

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
to hide the rest of my model with my

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.680 
to hide the rest of my model with my
control<00:03:22.560> H<00:03:22.739> keyboard<00:03:23.519> shortcut<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.540> have

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
control H keyboard shortcut we have

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.539 
control H keyboard shortcut we have
these<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.109> groups<00:03:25.349> we<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.859> interior<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
these two groups we have interior and

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.300 
these two groups we have interior and
exterior<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.260> exterior<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.919> going<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.160> be

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
exterior so the exterior is going to be

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.629 
exterior so the exterior is going to be
on<00:03:29.489> our<00:03:29.810> conceptual<00:03:30.810> exterior<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.889> the

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
on our conceptual exterior and the

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.339 
on our conceptual exterior and the
interior<00:03:32.669> is<00:03:33.359> going<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.019> our

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
interior is going to be on our

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.159 
interior is going to be on our
conceptual<00:03:35.130> interior<00:03:36.030> that's<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.049> give

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
conceptual interior that's going to give

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.080 
conceptual interior that's going to give
us<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.739> switch<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.489> allows<00:03:38.760> us<00:03:38.790> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
us that that switch that allows us to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.280 
us that that switch that allows us to
control<00:03:39.359> whether<00:03:39.690> we're<00:03:39.930> looking<00:03:39.959> at

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
control whether we're looking at

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.220 
control whether we're looking at
interior<00:03:41.130> or<00:03:41.340> exterior<00:03:41.569> so<00:03:42.569> check<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.049> out

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
interior or exterior so check that out

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.470 
interior or exterior so check that out
if<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.680> unhide<00:03:44.160> everything<00:03:44.549> now<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.359> look

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
if I unhide everything now we can look

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.629 
if I unhide everything now we can look
at<00:03:45.660> our<00:03:45.810> interior<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> look<00:03:47.400> at<00:03:47.519> our

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
at our interior we can look at our

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.089 
at our interior we can look at our
exterior<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.700> go<00:03:50.819> on<00:03:51.060> off<00:03:51.709> site<00:03:52.709> not

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
exterior and you can go on off site not

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.369 
exterior and you can go on off site not
quite<00:03:53.370> set<00:03:53.609> up<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.750> that's<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.169> really

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
quite set up but that that's a really

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.470 
quite set up but that that's a really
slick<00:03:55.680> tool<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> set<00:03:57.180> up<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:57.419> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
slick tool to have that set up so you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
slick tool to have that set up so you
can<00:03:57.660> work<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.109> inside<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.530> your<00:03:58.799> model<00:03:59.160> and

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
can work on the inside of your model and

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
can work on the inside of your model and
then<00:03:59.879> work<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.720> outside<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.379> model

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
then work on the outside of the model

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.289 
then work on the outside of the model
you<00:04:01.829> can<00:04:01.859> see<00:04:01.980> how<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.340> interior<00:04:02.849> walls<00:04:03.090> are

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
you can see how the interior walls are

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.780 
you can see how the interior walls are
turned<00:04:03.540> off<00:04:03.660> floors<00:04:04.590> are<00:04:04.709> turned<00:04:04.950> off<00:04:05.129> so

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
turned off floors are turned off so

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.670 
turned off floors are turned off so
those<00:04:06.629> lawyers<00:04:06.840> states<00:04:07.169> are<00:04:07.319> definitely

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
those lawyers states are definitely

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.020 
those lawyers states are definitely
adjustable<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.370> they're<00:04:08.549> already<00:04:08.730> set<00:04:09.000> up

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
adjustable but they're already set up

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.439 
adjustable but they're already set up
for<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.769> we've<00:04:11.250> got<00:04:11.430> our<00:04:11.549> model<00:04:11.790> organized

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
for you so we've got our model organized

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.569 
for you so we've got our model organized
but<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:12.810> have<00:04:12.959> another<00:04:13.530> conceptual<00:04:14.370> layer

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
but we have another conceptual layer

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.849 
but we have another conceptual layer
that<00:04:14.760> we<00:04:14.879> need<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.180> address<00:04:15.449> and<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
that we need to address and that is the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.580 
that we need to address and that is the
fact<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.190> doors<00:04:17.639> do<00:04:18.329> not<00:04:18.479> render<00:04:18.840> properly

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
fact that doors do not render properly

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.000 
fact that doors do not render properly
when<00:04:20.190> sliced<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.060> section<00:04:21.539> cut<00:04:21.719> so<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.469> door

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
when sliced with a section cut so a door

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.180 
when sliced with a section cut so a door
would<00:04:23.969> typically<00:04:24.330> have

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
would typically have

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.650 
would typically have
a<00:04:25.250> door<00:04:25.910> with<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> an<00:04:26.840> arc<00:04:27.170> for<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> swing<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:29.300> any

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
a door with a an arc for a swing so any

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.230 
a door with a an arc for a swing so any
entity<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.590> does<00:04:30.650> not<00:04:30.890> render<00:04:31.310> properly<00:04:31.910> in

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
entity that does not render properly in

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.710 
entity that does not render properly in
plan<00:04:33.040> for<00:04:34.040> instance<00:04:34.370> doors<00:04:34.760> or<00:04:35.120> upper

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
plan for instance doors or upper

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.350 
plan for instance doors or upper
cabinets<00:04:36.230> things<00:04:36.830> like<00:04:37.040> that<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.970> need<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.210> add

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
cabinets things like that we need to add

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.500 
cabinets things like that we need to add
a<00:04:38.390> 2d<00:04:38.840> graphic<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.500> assign<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.940> door<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
a 2d graphic and assign the door to the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.780 
a 2d graphic and assign the door to the
3d<00:04:41.840> object<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.830> I'm<00:04:43.070> going<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.280> go<00:04:43.400> inside<00:04:43.760> of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
3d object so I'm going to go inside of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.120 
3d object so I'm going to go inside of
my<00:04:44.000> door<00:04:44.210> component<00:04:44.810> I'm<00:04:45.470> going<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.770> make<00:04:45.920> this

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
my door component I'm going to make this

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.910 
my door component I'm going to make this
a<00:04:46.190> group<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.820> then<00:04:47.660> I'm<00:04:47.780> going<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.080> draw<00:04:48.320> my<00:04:48.590> 2d

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
a group and then I'm going to draw my 2d

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.760 
a group and then I'm going to draw my 2d
graphics<00:04:49.430> so<00:04:49.580> I'll<00:04:49.670> just<00:04:49.850> draw<00:04:50.090> my<00:04:50.660> arc<00:04:50.990> with<00:04:51.740> a

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
graphics so I'll just draw my arc with a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.090 
graphics so I'll just draw my arc with a
line<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:53.270> line<00:04:53.510> here<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.290> I'll<00:04:54.890> use<00:04:55.070> my

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
line and a line here and I'll use my

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.370 
line and a line here and I'll use my
eraser<00:04:55.460> tool<00:04:55.820> clean<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.330> up<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.720> make<00:04:57.350> a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
eraser tool clean that up and make a

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.320 
eraser tool clean that up and make a
copy<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.890> this<00:04:58.010> at<00:04:58.250> one-and-a-half<00:04:58.700> inches

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
copy of this at one-and-a-half inches

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.260 
copy of this at one-and-a-half inches
and<00:04:59.920> then<00:05:00.920> let's<00:05:01.160> go<00:05:01.310> down<00:05:01.340> here<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:02.090> can

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
and then let's go down here and I can

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.510 
and then let's go down here and I can
just<00:05:02.390> kind<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.750> cap<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.230> off<00:05:03.470> actually<00:05:04.160> I

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
just kind of cap this off actually I

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.730 
just kind of cap this off actually I
could<00:05:04.640> even<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.030> do<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:07.210> there<00:05:08.590> okay<00:05:09.590> and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
could even just do this there okay and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.720 
could even just do this there okay and
then<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.760> going<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.780> be<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:11.990> group<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.730> we

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
then this is going to be a group and we

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.250 
then this is going to be a group and we
need<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.000> further<00:05:14.240> just<00:05:14.570> clean<00:05:14.780> up<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.080> one

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
need to further just clean up that one

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.250 
need to further just clean up that one
last<00:05:15.530> piece<00:05:15.800> there<00:05:16.040> okay<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.330> now<00:05:17.600> what<00:05:18.110> we're

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
last piece there okay so now what we're

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.470 
last piece there okay so now what we're
looking<00:05:18.290> at<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:18.890> inside<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.850> our<00:05:20.120> door

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
looking at is inside of our door

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.870 
looking at is inside of our door
component<00:05:21.110> we<00:05:21.740> have<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:22.280> 3d<00:05:23.240> object<00:05:23.420> and<00:05:24.880> we

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
component we have a 3d object and we

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.850 
component we have a 3d object and we
have<00:05:26.150> a<00:05:26.560> 2d<00:05:27.560> graphic<00:05:28.040> so<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:29.120> way<00:05:29.930> when<00:05:30.710> we

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
have a 2d graphic so that way when we

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.860 
have a 2d graphic so that way when we
render<00:05:31.100> our<00:05:31.370> door<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:31.820> plan<00:05:32.150> it's<00:05:32.570> going<00:05:32.810> to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
render our door and plan it's going to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.230 
render our door and plan it's going to
look<00:05:33.050> like<00:05:33.290> a<00:05:33.320> door<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.280> windows<00:05:34.669> typically

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
look like a door the windows typically

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.610 
look like a door the windows typically
well<00:05:35.540> when<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:35.780> build<00:05:35.960> them<00:05:36.020> like<00:05:36.200> this<00:05:36.380> they

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
well when you build them like this they

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.860 
well when you build them like this they
do<00:05:36.680> slice<00:05:37.130> correctly<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.850> if<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:38.600> want<00:05:38.780> to

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
do slice correctly and if you want to

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.600 
do slice correctly and if you want to
have<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.020> lot<00:05:39.260> of<00:05:39.290> detail<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.770> your<00:05:40.040> window<00:05:40.400> if

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
have a lot of detail to your window if

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.490 
have a lot of detail to your window if
you're<00:05:41.210> creating<00:05:41.630> photo-real<00:05:42.110> renderings

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
you're creating photo-real renderings

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.980 
you're creating photo-real renderings
based<00:05:42.740> on<00:05:42.980> or<00:05:43.280> from<00:05:43.760> this<00:05:43.880> model<00:05:44.300> then<00:05:44.419> it's<00:05:44.870> a

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
based on or from this model then it's a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.810 
based on or from this model then it's a
good<00:05:45.140> idea<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.470> have<00:05:45.620> your<00:05:45.890> detailed<00:05:46.490> window

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
good idea to have your detailed window

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.600 
good idea to have your detailed window
and<00:05:47.060> just<00:05:47.210> give<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.690> 2d<00:05:47.990> graphic<00:05:48.470> but<00:05:48.710> for

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
and just give it a 2d graphic but for

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.880 
and just give it a 2d graphic but for
this<00:05:49.700> example<00:05:50.060> these<00:05:50.300> windows<00:05:50.660> do<00:05:50.870> slice<00:05:51.200> real

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
this example these windows do slice real

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.240 
this example these windows do slice real
nice<00:05:52.100> and<00:05:52.280> clean<00:05:52.960> alright<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.140> then<00:05:54.290> we'll

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
nice and clean alright so then we'll

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.550 
nice and clean alright so then we'll
just<00:05:55.280> unhide<00:05:55.970> all<00:05:57.070> all<00:05:58.070> right<00:05:58.130> so<00:05:58.430> now<00:05:58.550> our

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
just unhide all all right so now our

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.310 
just unhide all all right so now our
model<00:06:00.560> is<00:06:00.980> pretty<00:06:01.880> organized<00:06:02.480> now<00:06:02.690> let's<00:06:03.140> see

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
model is pretty organized now let's see

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.170 
model is pretty organized now let's see
all<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.770> let's<00:06:04.040> just<00:06:04.130> verify<00:06:04.340> we've<00:06:04.880> got<00:06:05.060> our

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
all on let's just verify we've got our

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.920 
all on let's just verify we've got our
floors<00:06:05.510> our<00:06:05.930> walls<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.150> our<00:06:08.150> roof<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:09.280> I

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
floors our walls and our roof and I

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.220 
floors our walls and our roof and I
think<00:06:11.930> we're<00:06:12.290> pretty<00:06:12.440> much<00:06:12.560> ready<00:06:12.890> to<00:06:12.950> go<00:06:13.040> for
