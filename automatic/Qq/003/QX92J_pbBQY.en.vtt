00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
to get to this spot so what I'm a zombie
the<00:00:23.550> window<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.939> break<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> down<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.660> keep<00:00:24.930> on

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and I just want to do a jump and then a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.349 
and I just want to do a jump and then a
jump<00:00:28.890> crouch<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.220> go<00:00:29.340> upon<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> highest<00:00:30.000> board

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
jump crouch to go upon the highest board

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
jump crouch to go upon the highest board
there<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.170> jump<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
there and then just to jump down to the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
there and then just to jump down to the
vertical<00:00:32.520> board<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> basically<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.710> wait

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
vertical board so basically just wait

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.740 
vertical board so basically just wait
for<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> zombie<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> balls<00:00:36.600> away

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
for a zombie now to take the balls away

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
for a zombie now to take the balls away
so<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.649> want<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> lag<00:00:38.040> switch<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> same

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so you just want to lag switch the same

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
so you just want to lag switch the same
as<00:00:38.820> inside<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> map<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:39.809> doing<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
as inside the map but we're doing it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
as inside the map but we're doing it
outside<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.530> map<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> makes<00:00:41.790> sense<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> get

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
outside the map so it makes sense to get

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.790 
outside the map so it makes sense to get
higher<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> window<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> I'll<00:00:43.350> lag<00:00:43.559> switch

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
higher on the window and I'll lag switch

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.229 
higher on the window and I'll lag switch
cuz<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> higher<00:00:44.670> chance<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.059> get<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
cuz you got a higher chance to get in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
cuz you got a higher chance to get in
see<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> David<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:51.649> kick<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> board

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
see you in so I David up kick the board

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.720 
see you in so I David up kick the board
lag<00:00:53.610> switch<00:00:56.149> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> ceiling<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lag switch on the ceiling there we go so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
lag switch on the ceiling there we go so
yeah<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.030> sure<00:01:00.210> there's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> whole<00:01:00.510> bunch<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
