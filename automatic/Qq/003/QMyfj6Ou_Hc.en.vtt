kakashi's como and he basically says
that<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.970> abe<00:01:30.090> gate<00:01:30.360> no<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.110> know

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that the abe gate no we don't know

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.660 
that the abe gate no we don't know
exactly<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.189> from<00:01:32.220> eight<00:01:32.490> get

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
exactly what we can see from eight get

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.890 
exactly what we can see from eight get
we've<00:01:32.820> never<00:01:33.030> seen<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> eighth<00:01:33.509> gate<00:01:33.750> before

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
we've never seen the eighth gate before

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.960 
we've never seen the eighth gate before
we<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> only<00:01:34.979> infer<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.670> only<00:01:35.729> guess

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we can only infer we can only guess

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
we can only infer we can only guess
about<00:01:36.180> how<00:01:36.360> powerful<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.380> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
about how powerful it is from what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.859 
about how powerful it is from what
people<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.950> inferred<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.869> pretty

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
people have inferred about it and pretty

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
people have inferred about it and pretty
much<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.320> we've<00:01:40.439> gotten<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:40.829> here

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
much from what we've gotten right here

from<00:01:54.479> what<00:01:54.630> Kakashi<00:01:54.960> says<00:01:55.259> he'll<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.530> hotel

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
from what Kakashi says he'll be hotel

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
from what Kakashi says he'll be hotel
explain<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> second<00:01:56.520> he'll<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.969> able<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
explain in a second he'll be able to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.609 
explain in a second he'll be able to
take<00:01:57.270> out<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> five<00:01:57.750> tailed<00:01:58.020> beasts<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.409> well

but<00:01:58.829> it'll<00:01:59.070> also<00:01:59.100> die<00:01:59.490> what<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> gather<00:02:00.630> from

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
but it'll also die what I gather from

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.950 
but it'll also die what I gather from
that<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:01.649> Kakashi<00:02:02.310> said<00:02:02.840> won't<00:02:03.840> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that is because Kakashi said won't you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
that is because Kakashi said won't you
die<00:02:04.200> after<00:02:04.619> using<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.070> talking<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970 
the
gates<00:02:13.209> power<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.440> pretty<00:02:14.560> much<00:02:14.650> info

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
gates power so we can pretty much info

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.640 
gates power so we can pretty much info
right<00:02:15.130> there<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.520> eight<00:02:16.150> gate<00:02:16.480> greater<00:02:17.319> sign

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
right there that eight gate greater sign

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.120 
right there that eight gate greater sign
five<00:02:18.459> tailed<00:02:19.330> beasts<00:02:19.780> um<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.800> probably

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
Fox is helping him so he's definitely

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.719 
Fox is helping him so he's definitely
gonna<00:05:55.449> do<00:05:55.659> it<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.409> thing<00:05:56.560> I'm<00:05:56.710> on<00:05:56.860> is<00:05:57.039> that

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
gonna do it but the thing I'm on is that

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.330 
gonna do it but the thing I'm on is that
I<00:05:57.789> think<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.870> Toby<00:05:59.590> might<00:05:59.740> use<00:05:59.919> this<00:06:00.099> as<00:06:00.279> a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
I think that Toby might use this as a

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.170 
I think that Toby might use this as a
distraction<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.300> capture<00:06:01.900> naruto<00:06:02.560> and<00:06:02.830> or<00:06:02.979> B

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
distraction to capture naruto and or B

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.189 
distraction to capture naruto and or B
because<00:06:04.180> b<00:06:04.210> is<00:06:04.419> already<00:06:04.659> weakened<00:06:04.960> if<00:06:05.110> you

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
because b is already weakened if you

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.140 
because b is already weakened if you
guys<00:06:05.349> remember<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:05.949> I'm<00:06:06.039> thinking<00:06:06.069> the<00:06:06.879> tip

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
guys remember so I'm thinking the tip

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.269 
guys remember so I'm thinking the tip
the<00:06:07.330> bombs<00:06:07.569> two<00:06:07.930> bombs<00:06:08.139> hit<00:06:08.349> explode<00:06:09.009> big

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
the bombs two bombs hit explode big

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.939 
the bombs two bombs hit explode big
distraction<00:06:09.610> Toby<00:06:10.389> appears<00:06:10.719> behind<00:06:10.900> be<00:06:11.349> grabs

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
distraction Toby appears behind be grabs

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.409 
distraction Toby appears behind be grabs
him<00:06:12.190> warps<00:06:12.669> him<00:06:12.789> into<00:06:12.969> a<00:06:13.000> different<00:06:13.300> dimension

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
him warps him into a different dimension

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.019 
him warps him into a different dimension
p<00:06:14.139> is<00:06:14.229> captured<00:06:14.740> that's<00:06:15.310> my<00:06:15.580> thoughts<00:06:15.879> and

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
p is captured that's my thoughts and

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.089 
p is captured that's my thoughts and
prediction<00:06:16.449> on<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.629> situation<00:06:16.889> now<00:06:17.889> not

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
prediction on the situation now not

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.409 
prediction on the situation now not
necessarily<00:06:18.610> it<00:06:18.699> could<00:06:18.729> just<00:06:18.909> be<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.240> bombs

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
necessarily it could just be the bombs

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.969 
necessarily it could just be the bombs
explode<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.020> they<00:06:20.080> go<00:06:20.199> back<00:06:20.379> to<00:06:20.409> fighting<00:06:20.529> and

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
explode and they go back to fighting and

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.260 
explode and they go back to fighting and
stuff<00:06:21.129> and<00:06:21.310> then<00:06:21.430> Toby<00:06:21.669> enters<00:06:21.909> the<00:06:22.000> fight<00:06:22.180> and

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
stuff and then Toby enters the fight and

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.850 
stuff and then Toby enters the fight and
he's<00:06:22.389> trying<00:06:22.599> to<00:06:22.659> fight<00:06:22.810> them<00:06:22.990> all<00:06:23.110> so<00:06:23.289> I<00:06:23.440> think

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
he's trying to fight them all so I think

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.200 
he's trying to fight them all so I think
that's<00:06:24.009> another<00:06:24.190> good<00:06:24.400> possibility<00:06:24.909> I'm<00:06:25.060> just

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
that's another good possibility I'm just

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.760 
that's another good possibility I'm just
saying<00:06:25.419> though<00:06:25.659> from<00:06:25.960> Toby's<00:06:26.289> comment<00:06:26.650> before

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
saying though from Toby's comment before

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.019 
saying though from Toby's comment before
that<00:06:27.129> sounds<00:06:27.430> like<00:06:27.550> something<00:06:27.729> that'll

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:28.029 
that sounds like something that'll

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.909 
that sounds like something that'll
probably<00:06:28.180> happen<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:28.719> me<00:06:28.870> anyways<00:06:29.800> the

probably happen to me anyways the

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.680 
probably happen to me anyways the
