00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
how do you tube Darlington farm here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.980 
how do you tube Darlington farm here
just<00:00:02.310> over<00:00:02.460> here<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> farm<00:00:02.939> as<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.600> see<00:00:03.780> I

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
just over here the farm as you can see I

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.220 
just over here the farm as you can see I
got<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.859> SI<00:00:05.160> 200<00:00:05.580> all<00:00:05.700> torn<00:00:05.940> apart<00:00:06.029> here<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.720> just

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
got my SI 200 all torn apart here I just

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.530 
got my SI 200 all torn apart here I just
pulled<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.589> torpedo<00:00:07.980> cover<00:00:08.220> off<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
pulled the torpedo cover off and the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.470 
pulled the torpedo cover off and the
brush<00:00:09.830> cover<00:00:10.830> off<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.790> kind<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> wanted<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
brush cover off and I kind of wanted to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.570 
brush cover off and I kind of wanted to
see<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> me<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.860> amazing<00:00:14.130> now

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
see this this to me is this amazing now

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180 
see this this to me is this amazing now
again<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.330> think<00:00:15.360> oh<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.560> looked<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
again this is I think oh I looked at the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.290 
again this is I think oh I looked at the
serial<00:00:17.490> number<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> if<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.150> remember

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
serial number and if I remember

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200 
serial number and if I remember
correctly<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.310> 1984-85<00:00:20.310> somewhere

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
correctly it was in 1984-85 somewhere

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.769 
correctly it was in 1984-85 somewhere
around<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.539> there

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
around in there

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.900 
around in there
and<00:00:21.990> there<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.830> brushes<00:00:23.250> aren't<00:00:23.760> even

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and there is the brushes aren't even

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
and there is the brushes aren't even
broken<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.330> yet<00:00:24.750> there's<00:00:25.380> absolutely<00:00:25.590> no

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
broken in yet there's absolutely no

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.150 
broken in yet there's absolutely no
Ridge<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.019> brushes<00:00:28.500> or<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
Ridge there on the brushes or the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.150 
Ridge there on the brushes or the
brushes<00:00:29.550> might<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> commutator<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:31.160> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
brushes might be a commutator there this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
brushes might be a commutator there this
is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> ridiculously<00:00:33.210> low<00:00:33.480> our<00:00:33.660> machine<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
is a ridiculously low our machine it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
is a ridiculously low our machine it
really<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.649> 120<00:00:35.989> 120<00:00:36.989> our<00:00:37.110> machine<00:00:37.670> pretty

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
really is 120 120 our machine pretty

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
really is 120 120 our machine pretty
wild<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.950> whole<00:00:41.250> machine<00:00:41.610> when<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> was

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
wild the whole machine when I got it was

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.590 
wild the whole machine when I got it was
covered<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.260> kind<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:44.000> nasty<00:00:45.000> black

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
covered in just this kind of nasty black

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
covered in just this kind of nasty black
funk<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.680> know<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> came<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
funk I don't know if it came out of a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.500 
funk I don't know if it came out of a
foundry<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.920> what<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.309> took<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.059> cover<00:00:51.420> off

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
foundry or what but I took the cover off

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
foundry or what but I took the cover off
here<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.170> try<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.469> take<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.710> air<00:00:52.829> compressor

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
here just try and take my air compressor

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
here just try and take my air compressor
and<00:00:53.250> blow<00:00:53.489> some<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.879> crud<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.750> but

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and blow some that crud out of there but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
and blow some that crud out of there but
I<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> running<00:00:56.520> pretty<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:58.020> kind

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I got it running pretty well I just kind

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010 
I got it running pretty well I just kind
of<00:00:58.410> adjusted<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> load<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> low<00:01:00.629> speed<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of adjusted the load the low speed in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
of adjusted the load the low speed in
the<00:01:01.109> high<00:01:01.199> speed<00:01:01.260> idle<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> low<00:01:02.399> speed<00:01:02.670> was

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the high speed idle the low speed was

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
the high speed idle the low speed was
set<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.120> tore<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> know

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
set up tore it was just you know

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
set up tore it was just you know
virtually<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> same<00:01:04.979> speed<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
virtually the same speed as the as a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.770 
virtually the same speed as the as a
high<00:01:06.810> speed<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> got<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.760> adjusted<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
high speed so I got that adjusted now it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.500 
high speed so I got that adjusted now it
idles<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> should<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
idles up and down the way it should and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
idles up and down the way it should and
the<00:01:12.510> high<00:01:12.659> speed<00:01:12.770> or<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> open<00:01:14.400> circuit

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the high speed or I set the open circuit

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
the high speed or I set the open circuit
voltage<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.420> 80<00:01:15.689> volts<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
voltage at about 80 volts I don't know

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
voltage at about 80 volts I don't know
exactly<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> supposed<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
exactly what it's supposed to be but it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.480 
exactly what it's supposed to be but it
seems<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> work<00:01:18.509> pretty<00:01:18.600> well<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
seems to work pretty well right there

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.280 
seems to work pretty well right there
I've<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> been<00:01:20.759> taking<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.960> I've<00:01:22.259> got

this piece of scrap here into a slag

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
this piece of scrap here into a slag
heap<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.229> been<00:01:43.350> trying<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:44.579> of

heap but I just been trying to kind of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.590 
heap but I just been trying to kind of
burn<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> engine<00:01:45.360> make<00:01:45.479> sure

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
burn in the engine make sure

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
burn in the engine make sure
everything's<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.079> work<00:01:46.259> okay<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.619> suspect

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
everything's gonna work okay I suspect
it<00:01:47.369> probably<00:01:47.420> well<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> don't

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it probably well I don't know I don't

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
it probably well I don't know I don't
know<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
know if it actually was into the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.530 
know if it actually was into the
break-in<00:01:50.759> procedure<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.329> way<00:01:51.390> you're

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
break-in procedure the way you're

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.700 
break-in procedure the way you're
supposed<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.700> say<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.240> trying<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
supposed to but and say just trying to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
supposed to but and say just trying to
get<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> engine<00:01:56.130> getting<00:01:56.280> hot<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
get the engine getting hot get it you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
get the engine getting hot get it you
know<00:01:57.930> try<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.740> burn<00:01:58.890> any<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> nasty<00:01:59.670> funk

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
know try and burn any of the nasty funk

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.209 
know try and burn any of the nasty funk
out<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.509> sitting<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.770> oil<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
out of it from sitting there the oil and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
out of it from sitting there the oil and
stuff<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> remarkably<00:02:03.060> clean<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.689> suspect

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
stuff is remarkably clean I suspect

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
stuff is remarkably clean I suspect
that's<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.219> propane

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that's from just because it's propane

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.809 
that's from just because it's propane
but<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> amazingly

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
but you know it really is amazingly

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
but you know it really is amazingly
clean<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.869> haven't<00:02:10.440> changed<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> oil<00:02:10.770> on

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
clean there I haven't changed the oil on

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.450 
clean there I haven't changed the oil on
it<00:02:11.160> yet<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
it yet I

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.640 
it yet I
was<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> try<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.780> run<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.530> get

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
was this going to try and run it and get

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.960 
was this going to try and run it and get
a<00:02:13.710> good<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.010> hot<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> couple<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.520> times<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
a good and hot a couple of times and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.880 
a good and hot a couple of times and
then<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.210> ahead<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.450> change<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> oil<00:02:15.890> now

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
then go ahead and change the oil now

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.700 
then go ahead and change the oil now
this<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:18.030> take<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> NAPA<00:02:18.600> or<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> oil

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
this will take a NAPA or is the oil

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.560 
this will take a NAPA or is the oil

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
I'm going to set up or buy a better oil

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.410 
filter arrangement they make aftermarket
ones<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> better<00:02:31.470> deal<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:33.000> better

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
deal oil filter because this is just a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860 
deal oil filter because this is just a
bypass<00:02:35.760> where<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> doesn't<00:02:36.330> filter<00:02:36.750> the

bypass where it doesn't filter the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.380 
bypass where it doesn't filter the
entire<00:02:37.110> engine<00:02:37.770> oil<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.340> filters<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
entire engine oil it just filters a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.260 
entire engine oil it just filters a
small<00:02:40.230> portion<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> engine<00:02:41.010> oil<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.550> with

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
small portion of the engine oil but with

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
small portion of the engine oil but with
the<00:02:42.360> propane<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:42.990> seems<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.590> burner

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
the propane there seems like it's burner

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.740 
the propane there seems like it's burner
it's<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.280> clean<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:45.180> where<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> guess

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
it's really clean that's where I guess

running like a top I am I think I'm
going<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.900> go<00:03:39.990> ahead<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.260> also<00:03:40.350> get<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> remote

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
going to go ahead and also get a remote

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.850 
going to go ahead and also get a remote
for<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.340> they<00:03:41.520> make<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:42.050> hot<00:03:43.050> box<00:03:43.260> remote<00:03:43.680> that

for it they make a hot box remote that

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.860 
for it they make a hot box remote that
oldest<00:03:44.190> after<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:44.940> installed<00:03:45.300> let's<00:03:45.660> plug

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
oldest after it's installed let's plug

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.500 
oldest after it's installed let's plug
in<00:03:46.050> here<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:47.280> you'll<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.640> remote

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
in here and then you'll have a remote

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.790 
in here and then you'll have a remote
amperage<00:03:48.900> control<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.410> also<00:03:49.530> has

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
amperage control that also has

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.490 
amperage control that also has
electricity<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.490> it<00:03:50.580> her<00:03:50.790> 110<00:03:51.390> DC<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.380> which

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
electricity in it her 110 DC in it which

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.070 
electricity in it her 110 DC in it which
would<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.740> kind<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:52.980> nice<00:03:53.270> but<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.330> pretty<00:03:54.930> good

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
