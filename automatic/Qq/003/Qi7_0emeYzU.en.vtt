00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.419

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.240

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:38.010
 caused traumas to this day 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 it is still one of the most efficient 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.860
 in history and gender more 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.970
 today a master class of sound 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.420
 mounts 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 this movie in the horror movie in 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.160
 the history of cinema 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.450
 who managed to murder a person in a 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.450
 cardiac arrest in london 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.470
 this sort of exorcism when these 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 cures are to save this triumph on 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.370
 make-up montage sound effects 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.370
 but if rowe price design understanding 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.100
 [Applause] 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:34.640
 in fourth place by the army 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.640
 and it continues to work until the 23rd 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 got damn 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:03.680
 he was not aware of this great devil 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.410
 described as the renaissance that I read 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.240
 read with satan's spelling as a male 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.970
 goat behind those tremendous 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.910
 makeups 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.850
 the actor jim carrey the same as the clown 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.280
 killer then old piece obviously he 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.440
 I had to conquer this woman 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 with this demon barnech your security and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.510
 secondly to cost 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.060
 stressed that he did not laugh this time as a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.700
 exorcist is already having peter 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 stormare as the ideal devil that 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.580
 You saw, say, the tip of white 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.840
 completely seditious old man 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.390
 terrible and satanic 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.580
 the guy obviously wraps himself with a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.679
 certain elegance 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.679
 [Music] 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.010
 that's what makes you like 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.100
 much more nervous 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.590
 because he has dignity of office and without 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.480
 However, this substance is the fallen angel 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.890
 for this type of satan I like 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.710
 exact and in fact there are many he looked 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.500
 big businessmen let's say they come 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.569
 towards very exact and looking for some 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.620
 way to master do not forget there 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.840
 outside line traffic that is trying 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.990
 soul raval is trying to get him out 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.569
 the cancer so that he continues to live 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.680
 curing them 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.810
 the disease that was not going to over 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.909
 obviously living in passing is more 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.040
 fail he is not going to take it anymore 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:42.319
 You added this sack to reach of the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.319
 lungs and I condemn you to live 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:52.629
 first place for the great sport 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.180
 of the filmmakers that his career has been 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.450
 pay homage to the creatures 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.670
 unknown from beyond 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.190
 it came and it was on the comic of it 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.040
 name is a true man of art 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.260
 of the comic and that clearly in their two 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.319
 movies caught the attention immediately 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.269
 of fanatical critics of the ninth art and 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.030
 of course also cinephile the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.250
 fuel by not hesitating in the first 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.590
 place there is for this demon that was 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.730
 convened to associate reality but 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.069
 it finally did not help 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.069
 [Applause]
