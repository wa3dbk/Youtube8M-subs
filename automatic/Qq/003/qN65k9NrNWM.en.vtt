00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.339
 Saturday 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.730
 It was personal welcome beauty but the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.259
 Only you Brazilian and 9 and personal 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.570
 show you some here today 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.449
 parts of some details information 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.009
 analysis even here the new eco champion 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.050
 champion that night games will launch in 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.399
 brief your case you like to write 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.140
 When you lose, it 's very important. 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.120
 is then follow the person for whom no 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.829
 knows the night games released yesterday if not 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.050
 I'm wrong a trailer a team 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.420
 similar to tradings that inform 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.980
 which shows him the new champion and some 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.140
 of its activities the champion is called 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.030
 echo and his decision is the boy who 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.220
 that destroyed what distorted the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 I'll try to show you what time to go. 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.790
 have not yet seen those who do not yet know 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.110
 if it is going to show the trailer that own 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.520
 art games released and we'll try 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.100
 analyze a little to know some 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.180
 relations and also characteristics of this 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 champion then let's go 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.189
 people waste a lot of time 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.060
 so they want to start reading with goku right now. 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.740
 well light well night but more hours in 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.159
 your days and more days in your more years 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.009
 years in your mouth and getting out is probably 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.840
 the champion is the one who has more 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.549
 some faces some features that I do not 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.729
 I know very well who they are but anyway the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.890
 queues because if they had all this time 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.319
 It's good there on the left side, guys. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.819
 in that painting may also be adin 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.319
 that is it will probably have 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.659
 some relationship with these two champions 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.039
 it is not certainty that the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.409
 his story intertwines when 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.799
 other champions 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.630
 they could fix any good and 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.390
 if the new champion is already being 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.060
 this little, skinny little boy with a 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.759
 white mohawk i do not need hours 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.479
 neither days nor both I just need 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.479
 seconds 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.420
 good this guy there that you are seeing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.700
 in the corner of the screen it is probably a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.930
 character of the faithful book that can be 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.969
 that will be the Indians and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.379
 enhanced it can also bn 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.409
 Batman escaping from Gotham City 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.120
 but it is very likely that a connection 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.000
 directly with me was the next 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.129
 champion may use improved what we 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 we know he is not he was 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.239
 confirmed that he is not the champion. 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.310
 Gote, then we will not have the pleasure. 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.090
 to see the champion voice with legs in a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.090
 belly six pack 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 hum am 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.420
 It's just that, that's the characteristic. 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.610
 of this new champion the ego and she 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.560
 makes it possible to understand several situations 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.170
 different things starting with the fact 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.480
 that it will be able to distort the time in the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.940
 if you go back a few seconds 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.620
 recent activities but we have two 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.840
 possibilities for this the first 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.140
 possibility is that it can reverse the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.850
 time of the game - for himself in some 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.700
 something specific area of the genre 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.610
 or he may return to the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.470
 own time that he is experiencing 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.800
 I say this because despite coming back 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.330
 of the time it continues to appear 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.120
 hurt and when your opponent 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.440
 back to the original form he was 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 then it may be that we had a 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.000
 ultimate that will bring the very echo of 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.880
 back to the time or else it goes 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.140
 bring you the match back to time 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720
 this is perhaps the main characteristic 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.330
 The champion does not have any information. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.930
 It's about that but we're just 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.930
 imagining 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 the is so once again he 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.500
 demonstrating that it may continue 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.240
 injured in case he lost the video 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.580
 continues his life since his 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.039
 adversary has no symptoms 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.509
 right to take part in a fight 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.180
 while he appears to have suffered 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.270
 a lot of damage despite coming back 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.270
 time 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.560
 Hi 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.199
 and other detail also that the 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.149
 The weapon he uses is a sword, right? 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.439
 a certain kind of sword which also 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.249
 leads him to believe that he will be a champion 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.649
 of attack 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.269
 in that it is going to attack the body 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.369
 body will not be a champion with the 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:28.249
 distance attack which rules out 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.409
 possibility of one acquires and usually 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.479
 the champions who go to django for 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.179
 jungle are champions that presents a 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.009
 physical size that is greater than that of being 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:38.839
 champion then it will probably be 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.330
 a champion of the midi is just one 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.129
 my expectation is based of course 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.199
 Garrote game concepts already released 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.459
 previously 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.459
 This is the time bid. 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.649
 if you can not make the most of it 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:53.649
 every moment 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.649
 does not deserve a second more 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.699
 So it's personal, this was the trailer for 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740
 release release of the eco champion 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.449
 but we do not have information yet about 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.949
 How's that going to be, how's it going? 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.020
 what are the skills of the 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.880
 champion like that his functionality 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.919
 but any future information 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.570
 I'll come back and bring you back as soon as 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.160
 to release it here in tb I will record a 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.540
 video showing ability to 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.280
 pitt then watch this stretch is 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.900
 asking for it if you know too much 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.160
 something comments on the comments that 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.050
 I used to exchange this idea 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.360
