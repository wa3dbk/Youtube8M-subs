00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.410
 arrived at the new european cr9060 harvester 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.329
 now made in Brazil 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.730
 the two futures stop 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.169
 would come in separation of the grains to cr9060 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.169
 was one of the great highlights of agrishow 2010 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.869
 officially launched at a press conference at the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.419
 Latin American agricultural machinery trade show 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.220
 this danil combine harvester brings to the field a new technology that 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.239
 promises to increase productivity in harvesting operations 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 this is the great demand to be a unique grace system of the producer the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150
 with the separation is true that the machine does 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.010
 aib is and there the concept deliver the best for the life of the market exactly 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.750
 that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.650
 in the launch of the series 90 60 in Brazil 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.900
 is part of the lisbon strategy 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.990
 put on the market every year 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.260
 a new version of securitate 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.949
 commenting on the company's capacity 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.959
 to meet the demand for heating machines is here in Brazil 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 already in the Brazilian product is first of all recognized that it needs pt 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 is 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 in the field of renault southern routine testing 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.950
 journalists and farmers invited to the event to launch the collection 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.160
 of 3 60 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 had the opportunity to see the machine in operation 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.520
 The party marks today. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.800
 it's the high supra-sumo that we have in the country it was nationalized now 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.750
 This can be that we do fine sunshine mine 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.140
 in addition to the dynamics that a 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.490
 one by one to an exceptional test condition that we can bring without 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.510
 any doubt 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.810
 the managers operators what has left it is a the sectional tiles have in the country 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 today that give this condition 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.479
 brooke years completed middle with the producers could in the dynamics test the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.820
 product then we want 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100
 W 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.440
 produced since 2002 in europe the service harvesters are manufactured 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.269
 in this jungle unit of June 13 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.400
 I was in the municipality of six thousand inhabitants located inside the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.339
 Belgium 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.229
 in this factory of more than 104 years of activities 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:26.639
 which the family the beginning the construction of the machines and after 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.319
 wheat 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.479
 and that some years later along with the invention of the motorcycle in the gasoline glass 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.849
 turned these small threshing machines into true harvesting machines 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.979
 grains 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.149
 inventions that have revolutionized food production around the world 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.569
 and here in the showroom of the aneor factory today we find the product that gave the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.079
 Niger to this whole story 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.759
 the first grain trainer of 1932 also has 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.209
 the first 1952 motorbike motorbike machine 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:06.349
 and here we find the latest technology. 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.089
 promoter who in 2008 joined the guinness book and with a machine that 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.899
 harvested more in less time 500 tons in eight hours 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.999
 its theodoro sands that produces corn soybean and wheat in uni in minas gerais' 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.710
 accompanied our team 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.790
 in the visit of the factory of the nihon roll of 15h 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 and was impressed to see that the same engine system as the old 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.199
 threshers 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.199
 equipped with modern harvesters today 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.549
 so far it seems that we have seen that this is the beginning 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.299
 of the steep eastward contour in the center of goiÃ¢nia, another evolution was 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.289
 great work 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:49.589
 and in europe because the nikkei the pina factory where that use that is the 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.349
 the Brazilian pilot that I could use these novelties today 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.649
 brazil is very advanced in the matter of network 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:01.430
 a technology the commercial dollar with two engines and she asks 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.420
 that you have a high operational performance allied to the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.319
 quality grades because it's like when you have two engines you work 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.749
 with smaller diameter but higher-powered engines 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.019
 this allows you to conquer peace and to get out of the straw elevator 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.640
 to get into the future of transition is smoother is right 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.180
 and allows what your track map act to occur in the middle of the two proposed future 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.770
 on stage the centrifugal force and pressure is employment for there not the agent 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.270
 commits soul of to the trail straw straw with grain to grain 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.990
 this allows you to have a quality that I superior because it has 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.080
 less friction 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.020
 between metallic components 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.919
 to our farmer friends who accompanied us on this trip 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.840
 visit to the billboard factory and in belgium 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.960
 was a great opportunity to have more knowledge about the new 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.259
 technologies for the field 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.419
 we are very pleased because you know closely 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.029
 you take that false image that sometimes you have some product 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.029
 So today we had it in the factory and we saw how the 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.119
 work that is done as effects products that are made and up is these 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.580
 machines parts collection of them so I was very satisfied with the tension 

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:21.239
 that we had here and closely watching this high quality product because it is 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:24.859
 manufactured here in Belgium is already a very traditional machine here in the 

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:25.510
 Europe 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.979
 and that this technology coming to Brazil I'm sure 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.979
 that it will so the inter stands out to stand out in the market 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.139
 and mainly 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.009
 for us farmers and only hitech another opportunity we have is more 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.949
 a shopping option we have and I'm sure with the farmers 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.279
 were very well served with this technology nor the steering wheel to their gala of the 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.629
 mato grosso you think this machine will bring opportunities 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.389
 tooth why 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.680
 it is a different one more this market 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.960
 her dismissal system 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.330
 along the dasju in that first more uniform so I asked 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.909
 was present on his property on the salary 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.500
 marquinhos we see so it is tradable market is demanding 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.589
 so it's a matter that brings us some more tammy quality safety 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:15.379
 of man 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:16.960
 is today 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.710
 you have quality and we will try to win three points behind the scoreboard 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.240
 a lot of lies - they've been concentrating for 35 years, right? 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.909
 now with Brazil the new concept with certainty 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.419
 the producer will gain much in regiment and grain quality by the numbers by the 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.669
 is the full development of the return it has in these long years of 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.220
 before the investigation and sale of machinery few double system 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.219
 more efficient tournament 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.099
 yea
