00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.220
 there is a summary of this permit played on 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 the incontrastable of an encounter that 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.079
 we anticipated he was going to be cautious 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 and will take care both teams 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.079
 We anticipated that it is that they take 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.329
 long is something that happened at the end of 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.039
 accounts the clearest possibilities 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.169
 especially the first stage had it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.600
 Garcilaso but we always say the same 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.070
 and this we do not say simply because 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.260
 comply we always say it by 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.290
 experience the goals that one was 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.420
 you usually do is that you do them and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.530
 that's what happened 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 university capitalized on the second 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 stage the clearest opportunity he had 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 that forced Garcilaso to face the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.609
 party differently go it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.379
 losing 1 to 0 with the height with what 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.570
 was supposed to give him favoritism what 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 forces to take risks tie the match 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 and from there already a series of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.269
 questions that force us to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.269
 get to those 30 extra minutes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.790
 in the second half of the German side the 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:18.950
 pains where he was 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.830
 in the first five minutes ten 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 minutes very well and then they threw 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.640
 back and that I think the club 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 It was 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.090
 and with that garcilazo do not do what 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.940
 they know their weapon attack the centers 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 and the result forces it to the result 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.440
 in 10 force if you're going to take some 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 risks and exit the fund from 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.210
 there we see a slightly more match 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.080
 already open when we enter the 80's 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 minutes 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.130
 we see that again they enter the caution 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 to mistrust to try to preserve the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.900
 result and trying to get there too 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.180
 in the best possible way to those 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.370
 supplementary stores 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.370
 I believe that garcilaso today 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.400
 to mind when he wanted to squeeze 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.140
 university strength the ability 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.600
 physical did not give for more 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.090
 in the physical state I think garcilaso 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.010
 allowed them to equate the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260
 actions also in time 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.180
 supplementary it was noted that give tongue 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.250
 the control of the university midfield 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.410
 with the young footballers and they entered 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 to reinforce that sector especially the case 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.600
 of nurseries and vargas what left a 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.030
 Very nice expression in sight with a 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.800
 recovery game and touches of the ball 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.750
 as a mixed student who was studying 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.850
 university in the 90 minutes that's why 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.739
 we speak the experience is good for 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.320
 this kind of definitions but the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.750
 experience said that garcilaso had 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.160
 to go to put impose conditions on 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 those three thousand two hundred and something 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.800
 physically from Huancayo 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.450
 could not the last go to the definition 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.240
 by the penalty 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 no less was thrown next to equal 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.190
 from galicia and duarte I think that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.340
 It was also important because 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.800
 came the garcilazo attacks not with 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.990
 many problems that he did when he 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.210
 they threw the front questions they had 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.720
 much trouble young people now what 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:30.060
 Vargas Vargas came in very well as he 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 He said at the end with a knife between 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.320
 teeth and the Chinese case ximénez for 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.290
 show that it is still valid of course 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.719
 there was the definition of the penal 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.620
 auction of christopher gonzález for 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:46.689
 mark in favor of u the catch of the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.700
 Carvalho goalkeeper at the auction of bouquets 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.519
 We said that he was not convinced of the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.159
 great stretched midfield goalie 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.950
 carvalho who was a figure 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.390
 by definition at the end carvalho 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.189
 result figures by penalties 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.409
 who attacked but then the match to 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.879
 understand you have to understand how they are going 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.590
 giving situations as you 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.540
 the penalties are charged by the pitu 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.980
 had as background will have lost a 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.090
 basic criminal law when 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.550
 college student winning 2 to 0 in the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.440
 monumental 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.760
 if I was getting that goal suddenly 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.320
 the situation was has been another 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.180
 but that background I think today 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.010
 It happened bill came very nervous without 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.240
 conviction without security and that what 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.920
 perfectly used carballo 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.920
 carvalho you for me 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.000
 protector when you meditated I think that 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.070
 it was important night experts 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 I think it's good and I think that u 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.920
 even your goal 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.840
 within the importances of those that 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.730
 we have to definitely talk about what 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.380
 important is the collective team to 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.720
 from there appear individualities 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.610
 bound by the circumstances carvalho 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.820
 As it stated by Jose Luis that tackle 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.650
 criminal penalties but I said the 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.020
 important and decisive it turns out to be 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.400
 duarte because he converts the goal he gives 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.830
 to university sports title 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.259
 in that sense the maturity discard of 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.419
 duarte acquired through time that 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.550
 ownership that security that gives you the 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.070
 technical command to face this 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.410
 championship I think it ends up being a 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.410
 duarte totally mature different 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.490
 very important I believe that maturity 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.750
 they have the quality never arribita a 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.750
 ball always comes out playing
