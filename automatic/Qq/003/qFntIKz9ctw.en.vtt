00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
well really you know you could spend a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.279 
well really you know you could spend a
lot<00:00:16.890> more<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.430> over<00:00:17.640> pieces<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.390> relax<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
lot more time over pieces and relax a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.460 
lot more time over pieces and relax a
lot<00:00:19.410> more<00:00:19.650> about<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:21.080> everybody's<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> do

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
lot more about it everybody's got to do

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
lot more about it everybody's got to do
a<00:00:22.500> certain<00:00:22.740> amount<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.160> work<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> company

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a certain amount of work for the company

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.929 
a certain amount of work for the company
but<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:25.949> glassmaking<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.789> need

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
but I think for two glassmaking you need

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429 
but I think for two glassmaking you need
to<00:00:27.000> take<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.390> over<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.840> bit<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
to take time over a little bit more and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.279 
to take time over a little bit more and
consider<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.279> more<00:00:30.109> obviously<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
consider it a bit more obviously it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
consider it a bit more obviously it's
all<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> blue<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> great

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
all in blue but you get a great

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
all in blue but you get a great
education<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.110> outside<00:00:34.469> line<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.980> form

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
education in the outside line of form

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
education in the outside line of form
that's<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.690> does<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.200> strength

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that's what it really does have strength

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
that's what it really does have strength
and<00:00:37.890> learning<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> blue<00:00:39.090> completely<00:00:39.600> because

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

we're at the form isn't very good but
the<00:00:45.750> color<00:00:45.960> technique<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.559> great<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.820> harder

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the color technique is great it's harder

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
the color technique is great it's harder
to<00:00:48.420> sell<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> piece<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.200> yeah<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> think

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
shape you've got more chance of selling

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.290

I flayed through there's another shape
that<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.379> could<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> could

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that you could you know you could

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
that you could you know you could

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
sort of right on the edge it's like you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.280 
sort of right on the edge it's like you
make<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> piece<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.020> putting<00:01:16.229> a

looked into a Roman workshop the glass

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
looked into a Roman workshop the glass
would<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.649> worked<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> exactly<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> same<00:02:08.580> way

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
would be worked in exactly the same way

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.330 
would be worked in exactly the same way
as<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.539> work<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.050> apart<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> fact<00:02:11.099> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
as we work it apart from the fact that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.930 
as we work it apart from the fact that
we<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.730> gas<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
we have gas and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.440 
we have gas and
add<00:02:13.180> wood<00:02:13.630> fired<00:02:13.990> furnaces<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:16.030> didn't<00:02:16.270> copy

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
add wood fired furnaces we didn't copy

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
add wood fired furnaces we didn't copy
the<00:02:16.690> original<00:02:16.780> Bristol<00:02:17.440> blue<00:02:17.590> forms<00:02:17.980> because

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the original Bristol blue forms because

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.240 
the original Bristol blue forms because
basically<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.870> glass<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.470> close<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:21.130> could

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
basically the glass is so close we could

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
basically the glass is so close we could
make<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.760> close<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.240> fairly<00:02:22.420> rough<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
make it so close it's fairly rough and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.150 
make it so close it's fairly rough and
ready<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.140> they<00:02:23.230> first<00:02:23.440> made<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.010> did

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
ready when they first made it if we did

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.620 
ready when they first made it if we did
it<00:02:24.250> rough<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.460> ready<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.120> mean<00:02:25.330> basically

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
it rough and ready now I mean basically

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.300 
it rough and ready now I mean basically
you<00:02:25.810> get<00:02:25.990> people<00:02:26.290> passing<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.770> stuff<00:02:26.980> off<00:02:27.160> his

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
you get people passing the stuff off his

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.570 
you get people passing the stuff off his
antiques<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.560> decided<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.100> keep<00:02:30.250> away<00:02:30.550> from

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
antiques so we decided to keep away from

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.880 
antiques so we decided to keep away from
the<00:02:30.940> original<00:02:31.390> Bristol<00:02:31.780> blue<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.530> we've<00:02:32.650> gone

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the original Bristol blue and we've gone

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.160 
the original Bristol blue and we've gone
to<00:02:33.100> sort<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.400> classical<00:02:33.940> forms<00:02:34.510> things<00:02:34.990> like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
to sort of classical forms things like

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.010 
to sort of classical forms things like
that<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.580> get<00:02:36.760> inspirations<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:37.840> the

people<00:04:10.620> 200<00:04:11.620> years<00:04:12.100> ago<00:04:13.380> glassblowers<00:04:14.380> were

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
people 200 years ago glassblowers were

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.670 
people 200 years ago glassblowers were
brought<00:04:14.800> in<00:04:14.950> from<00:04:15.160> all<00:04:15.310> over<00:04:15.340> Europe<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.680> I'd

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
brought in from all over Europe and I'd

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.620 
brought in from all over Europe and I'd
very<00:04:18.250> much<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.700> see<00:04:19.000> all<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.269> happen

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
very much like to see all this happen

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.010 
very much like to see all this happen
again<00:04:19.900> it's<00:04:20.560> not<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.930> repetition<00:04:22.930> of

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
again it's not that it's a repetition of

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.540 
again it's not that it's a repetition of
history<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.680> i<00:04:23.950> think<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
history but i think the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.390 
history but i think the
modern<00:04:25.759> movement<00:04:25.970> should<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.470> center<00:04:28.280> of

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
modern movement should be this center of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.279 
modern movement should be this center of
excellence<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:29.030> Bristol<00:04:29.509> where

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
excellence in Bristol where

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.290 
excellence in Bristol where
international<00:04:30.680> glassblowers<00:04:31.580> come<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
international glassblowers come to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.510 
international glassblowers come to
Bristol<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:33.379> show<00:04:33.620> off<00:04:33.740> their<00:04:33.919> skills<00:04:33.979> and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
Bristol to show off their skills and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.010 
Bristol to show off their skills and
exhibit<00:04:34.940> their<00:04:35.539> craft<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:38.419> Bristol<00:04:38.810> glass

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
exhibit their craft the Bristol glass

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.350 
exhibit their craft the Bristol glass
now<00:04:39.259> is<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:40.580> quite<00:04:40.699> sharp<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:41.300> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
now is I think it's quite sharp in the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.589 
now is I think it's quite sharp in the
matter<00:04:42.759> we've<00:04:43.759> actually<00:04:43.940> had<00:04:44.270> sort<00:04:44.569> of

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
matter we've actually had sort of

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.360 
matter we've actually had sort of
customers<00:04:45.139> come<00:04:45.349> and<00:04:45.500> say<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.680> us<00:04:45.889> it's<00:04:46.129> too

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
customers come and say to us it's too

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.850 
customers come and say to us it's too
sharp<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.780> doesn't<00:04:48.199> look<00:04:48.409> how<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.590> made

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
sharp it's it doesn't look how I made

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.649 
sharp it's it doesn't look how I made
but<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.520> just<00:04:49.729> think<00:04:49.789> that's<00:04:49.970> just<00:04:50.300> something

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
but I just think that's just something

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.930 
but I just think that's just something
that<00:04:50.960> it's<00:04:51.169> good<00:04:51.889> we<00:04:52.039> got<00:04:52.190> very<00:04:52.400> good<00:04:52.460> makers

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
that it's good we got very good makers

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.200 
that it's good we got very good makers

had a module on glass and I sort of sort
of<00:05:07.550> twigged<00:05:07.909> and<00:05:08.120> became<00:05:08.389> really<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:09.409> was<00:05:09.530> very

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
of twigged and became really it was very

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.170 
of twigged and became really it was very
important<00:05:10.099> to<00:05:10.159> me<00:05:10.219> I<00:05:10.280> had<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.580> carry<00:05:11.060> on

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
working in that material it's a very

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.369 
working in that material it's a very
fluid<00:05:13.370> material<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.870> instead<00:05:15.169> of<00:05:15.259> it<00:05:15.349> being

that<00:07:33.250> it<00:07:33.430> had<00:07:33.580> something<00:07:33.879> that<00:07:34.060> made<00:07:34.300> the<00:07:34.569> name

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:34.719 
that it had something that made the name

that it had something that made the name
of<00:07:34.900> Bristol<00:07:35.319> renowned<00:07:35.979> throughout<00:07:36.159> the<00:07:36.430> world
