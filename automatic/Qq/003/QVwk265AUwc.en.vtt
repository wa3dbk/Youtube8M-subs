00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
vessel wall so now you pressing me to do

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.360 
vessel wall so now you pressing me to do
is<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.910> sense<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.190> not

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
running a very stable life yes I'm not

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.369 
running a very stable life yes I'm not
the<00:00:46.170> best<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:47.340> came<00:00:47.670> 10<00:00:50.270> not<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:52.250> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
the best there came 10 not so good so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
the best there came 10 not so good so
the<00:00:55.379> next<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.989> how

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the next that you want to do is not how

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
the next that you want to do is not how
I<00:00:58.230> happened<00:00:58.440> everything<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> addressed<00:01:00.059> your

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I happened everything it addressed your

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
I happened everything it addressed your
video<00:01:00.539> settings<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.680> were<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
video settings so they were like this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.460 
video settings so they were like this
this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.870> fast<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.559> FPS<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.700> get

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
this is actually fast as FPS you can get

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.990 
this is actually fast as FPS you can get
so<00:01:07.729> ah<00:01:10.670> obviously<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.869> effective

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
so ah obviously it's not too effective

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
so ah obviously it's not too effective
it<00:01:15.000> might<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> lot<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> people

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it might be that for a lot of people

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
it might be that for a lot of people
something<00:01:17.670> people<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.540> effective<00:01:19.290> like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
something people really effective like

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
something people really effective like
that<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.880> holding<00:01:21.330> them

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that that's what it was holding them

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.410 
that that's what it was holding them
back<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.040> some<00:01:23.040> people<00:01:23.159> don't<00:01:23.340> mind<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
back and some people don't mind not the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
back and some people don't mind not the
fact<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:26.880> work

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
fact that all so if that doesn't work

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.760 
fact that all so if that doesn't work
then<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.680> always<00:01:29.420> equate<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.900> ram<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
then you can always equate more ram to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
then you can always equate more ram to
Minecraft<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.780> real

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
Minecraft and how you do that is real

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.770 
Minecraft and how you do that is real
now<00:01:35.060> look<00:01:36.060> bad<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.560> get

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.410 

you<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:45.659> no<00:01:46.659> no<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:46.990> saying<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.880> get<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
you get no no I'm saying so you get the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.620 
you get no no I'm saying so you get the
piece<00:01:53.200> right<00:01:53.500> here<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.009> this<00:01:54.460> template<00:01:55.420> in

there now the next one the next step is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.350 
there now the next one the next step is
figure<00:02:41.620> out<00:02:41.680> how<00:02:42.010> much<00:02:42.160> RAM<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.269> do
