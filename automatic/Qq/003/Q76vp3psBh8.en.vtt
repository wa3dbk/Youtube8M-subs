00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.310
 yes he was welcome or welcome to this 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.050
 new video tutorial on this occasion 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.119
 I want to explain how to remove the 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.950
 administrator permissions in windows 8 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.869
 when we talk about the permits of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.730
 administrator is this window that we 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.619
 appears every time we are going to install or 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.220
 uninstall an application in our 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.720
 computer always dims in our 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.550
 on our desk and we always 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 it appears we have to give it or yes or that 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.380
 do not 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.390
 sometimes this becomes a bit 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.070
 annoying since at every moment and 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.480
 appearing that if you download a 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 program is downloading a 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.260
 application if you have to execute it or not 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 then a little annoyed by that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 then sometimes it is preferable 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.770
 deactivate it and we're going to do it 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 next way with the cursor here in 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.760
 windows 8 what if it takes towards the part 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.190
 right of the desk and we're going to go 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.840
 to this option that says configuration in 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
 this panel that opens up we are going to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.130
 go to the second option that says panel of 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.839
 control and here in the elements of the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.479
 control panel we're not going to go to a 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.460
 option that says user accounts 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.960
 here in user account let's go to 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.970
 the last option tells us to change 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.030
 account control configuration 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.470
 user and we see that it is in the second 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.140
 option that says notify 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.630
 only when an application tries 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.230
 make changes to the computer so 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.420
 let's leave it in the last option in 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.880
 the last one that says not to notify me never 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 when the applications tried to install 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.180
 software or make changes and not 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.830
 they notified when they do 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 changes in windows settings 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.820
 how are we supposed to have an antivirus 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.080
 and that we are aware of what 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 we are doing then we are not going to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.670
 have no problem and with this we are going to 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.920
 let us not again 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.140
 appear in that little box that says yes 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.300
 We want the changes to be made or 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.220
 not then here in this option since 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.040
 we choose the last option not 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.860
 notify me ever and we must click on 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.450
 accept now I get it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.740
 that again service book that 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.759
 you can not see it in the video 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.350
 tutorial and we give then yes 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.700
 that if we accept what we are doing 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.380
 and we close this option with this and each 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 Once we are going to install it is to install a 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.040
 program because it will follow us 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 appearing that notification box 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 in which he asks us if we are of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.670
 agreement or not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.739
