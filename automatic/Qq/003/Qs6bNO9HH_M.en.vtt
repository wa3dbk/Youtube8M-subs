00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 or soccer 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.660
 but for some young people this is sufficient 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.910
 not in a long time 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.460
 and so they opt for a special one 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.119
 sport like 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.119
 roller derby
