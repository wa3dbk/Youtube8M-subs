00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello guys for those who have not seen me yet 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.980
 I recently posted a tutorial on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.260
 how to create pokémons in pk rex and ok 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 basic tutorial and super explanatory 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 so whoever is curious about 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.439
 I got a program there and I come today. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.000
 bring one more lc fight without finally 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 I changed my team. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.399
 now the power of the first generation to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.370
 second and this was a fight against 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.210
 zago know brought the pokémons that I saw 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.739
 very little in my fight against them and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 especially this magic to speak to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.280
 true I'm a little afraid of her 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 because I have no idea what he 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 be able to do with it and the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.070
 now born team with the medical bag to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 to return the fox system of the opposing team 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 the Peruvian to erp to protect me from 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.539
 any Pokemon that snort the team 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.329
 the panic to put some 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 safety reasons with good force 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.810
 offensive to my bellsport 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.270
 second generation and the tribute as a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.420
 defensive pokémon also giving support 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.420
 for the good team this is it there we go 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 sure start against honey actually I 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.130
 I hoped he would start 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.700
 understood perhaps to rely on 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.610
 approx 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.219
 so I ended up bringing a born first 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.590
 shift kamel goal with the causing package 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.200
 a little damage against the unborn and in the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.240
 next turn and attacked the rethane now 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.130
 without causing a great championship damage and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.469
 I complete that with December because 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.399
 in fact I confused the bulk with the 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.350
 that the evolution of the pay-line and 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.659
 this was an error and a new one 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.829
 Come back now put an end in the middle 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.739
 Natural 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.810
 good now brought the page buy fight ia 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.390
 also increased that caused 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.289
 panic damage but not yet 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.149
 enough 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.549
 I took some touches 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.420
 peace in the opponent's field 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.910
 while feeding the regions with the globe 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.819
 but now my borges has been activated to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.560
 recovering the whole life of panic in this 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.690
 I still took the opportunity to put the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.510
 is ready too and now the team of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.650
 zaire has two reasons in the field 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.780
 their 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.420
 the Flemish is wearing a new ring and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.579
 causing more damage against panic and I 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.889
 I tried to attack i compagni kills waiting 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.680
 the bank will consume Aberjil 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:35.410
 This is the reverse but apparently this is only 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.540
 works with pretty even with the see says 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.400
 that it has no effect whatsoever 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.650
 no problem on my goal with a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.290
 number that ended up being a critic 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.540
 leaving the panel with one of life and now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.849
 I could not attack him with the call center 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.180
 which of course was enough to 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.160
 Defeat the Honey Water with and now use the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.780
 your tim burton the timbu fight was 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.310
 poisoned to the touch of countries that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.739
 lost the first seems so strong 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.239
 that it has a mac stain that is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.299
 of course was sufficient to avoid the 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.590
 panic with life and our father nor the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.299
 fall job was defeated and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.960
 now it's time to bring an upper for the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.620
 fight 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.840
 tibor mako with the infant doing well 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.910
 little giving against turkey 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 and how did I know he would attack me? 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.260
 of prepared a place where it is again 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.100
 can do great harm against 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.860
 the possum is this he attacked me with 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.840
 a new transplant reducing another one 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.310
 little life of the womb and I came 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.860
 prepared a new call center 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.580
 now if he putting an end to the team 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.260
 heal or else a defender's pokémon 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.360
 rotated and now brought some free of it 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.870
 snipe also poisoned for the pits 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.760
 paix getting looking after the star fox and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.970
 he got the doctor to unip and this time 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.990
 There is no way to get over pine volpi 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.380
 well the defeated perh and look to bring 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.690
 my secret weapon for combat 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.460
 good goes there mag shows why you see 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.590
 due to the disadvantage of type the defendants 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.710
 had to collect the levels and bring the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.540
 fight climate that was also 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:25.970
 hospital and I took advantage of this exchange 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.700
 to activate my beautiful drama pump and 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.770
 domination and now the mec is 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.650
 six of attack or is an attack of him 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.230
 is maximized got half of life 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.390
 and he consumed the berj a lighter was 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.090
 loading now recovering all life 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.950
 again and now I want to see you 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.710
 these areas 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.420
 the next to have plans like breads that 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.080
 turned out to be enough to defeat 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.770
 and use and now brought the xix to the 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.540
 fight 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.820
 in fact, slave x would be more 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.550
 fast with the doctor but there is to it 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.470
 punch even and apparently the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.690
 Mac is faster than he can 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.840
 attack before as fans now putting a 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.860
 order us 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.889
 also the defender finally brought the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.710
 doctor asks but is not a good team to 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.080
 she already ate mégre has thunder punch 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.030
 also and it is clear that this mother of Karla 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.590
 will not survive self-cleaning that I 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.360
 I used against her in defeated indycar and 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.930
 to use now has brought a 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.150
 good level combat pokémon pretty fast 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.710
 and he'll probably be able to attack 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.710
 before yes on the bridge with the official twitter 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.639
 of the year but cause me to face what is not 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.139
 not good 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.560
 but I doubt he'll be able to cause 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.320
 a front until the negue is defeated by the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.270
 even putting the people you are causing 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.150
 few changing but this time did not fail 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.320
 front and a fire pan was enough 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.180
 to defeat this visible and with that I 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.310
 giving the victory of combat 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.560
 Okay, so my new team is there. 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.919
 has become champion until then has left 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.139
 super well in fights and only remembering 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.370
 from this post to challenge before in 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.710
 Thursday 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.760
 I will not be giving priority anymore 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.280
 to luca 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.570
 The reason for this is that now complete rex 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.110
 no longer have any difficulty 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.570
 to create the team in the field 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.120
 maybe I'll leave some reserved places 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:28.110
 especially for the European but that I 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.760
 I'm going to take a study and that's it 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.780
