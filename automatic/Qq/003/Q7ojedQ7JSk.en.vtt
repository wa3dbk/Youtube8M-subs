 butter 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.230

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 we will need flour and loosen the flour i 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 add a teaspoon of baking powder and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:08.820
 mix a little bit and gradually introduce

 I think that a little bit of flour and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.600
 enough booties 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:03.030
 if the dough turned out very thick you can 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:18.560
 add a little milk or sour cream 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:23.159

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.360

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:51.650
 for baking shoulder put the cake in the oven 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:56.130
 180 degrees and check the toothpick 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.040
 the average is 30 40 minutes to follow 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.740
 so that the cake does not burn and a toothpick and 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:08.180
