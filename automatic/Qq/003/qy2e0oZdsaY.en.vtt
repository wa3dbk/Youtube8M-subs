like the looks of it it just looks very

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
like the looks of it it just looks very
clean<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.020> simple<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:23.130> doesn't<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> lot

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
clean and simple it doesn't have a lot

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.160 
clean and simple it doesn't have a lot
of<00:00:23.760> doodads<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of doodads on it that will get in the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.339 
of doodads on it that will get in the
way<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> blade<00:00:26.789> length<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> four<00:00:27.689> inches<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
way the blade length is four inches and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
way the blade length is four inches and
the<00:00:29.099> width<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.609> 0.1<00:00:30.390> 3/5<00:00:31.140> inches<00:00:31.710> oh<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.790> got

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the width is 0.1 3/5 inches oh it's got

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.370 
the width is 0.1 3/5 inches oh it's got
a<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> width<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a little bit of a width to it or a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
a little bit of a width to it or a
little<00:00:34.980> bit<00:00:35.190> larger<00:00:35.940> width<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
little bit larger width and see like a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
little bit larger width and see like a
Kershaw<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.380> something<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
Kershaw would have or something of that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.209 
Kershaw would have or something of that

I<00:00:38.820> prefer<00:00:39.450> blades<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> length<00:00:40.350> because

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I prefer blades of this length because

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979 
I prefer blades of this length because
they're<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.460> general-purpose<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.390> you

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
they're more general-purpose then you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.220 
they're more general-purpose then you
can<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:44.600> delicate<00:00:45.600> jobs<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.079> also

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
can use them for delicate jobs but also

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.290 
can use them for delicate jobs but also
for<00:00:46.620> trying<00:00:47.190> stuff<00:00:47.460> open<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> needed<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
for trying stuff open if you needed to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
for trying stuff open if you needed to
or<00:00:48.719> food<00:00:49.050> prep<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.469> something<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
or food prep or something like that so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
or food prep or something like that so
general<00:00:51.030> purpose<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.510> Ives<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.809> tend<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> have

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
general purpose and Ives I tend to have

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
general purpose and Ives I tend to have
a<00:00:53.010> lot<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.190> respect<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:55.020> blade<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a lot more respect for the blade is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.760 
a lot more respect for the blade is

well and that's why I saw he uses it a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.570 
well and that's why I saw he uses it a
lot<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.510> very<00:01:06.600> also<00:01:06.930> comfortable<00:01:07.500> 208<00:01:08.340> or

it's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> straight<00:01:20.759> edge<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.270> serrations

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it's a straight edge because serrations

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's a straight edge because serrations
are<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> crap<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> stupid<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:25.590> registers<00:01:26.280> the

from<00:01:56.460> steel<00:01:56.939> liners<00:01:57.439> because<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.579> reasons

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
from steel liners because of two reasons

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
from steel liners because of two reasons
number<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.329> save<00:02:00.540> weight<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> also

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
number one to save weight and also

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
number one to save weight and also
because<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> materials<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> they<00:02:02.880> use<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
because the materials that they use of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
because the materials that they use of
advanced<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> point<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> crust

strength<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> handles<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> pretty

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
strength of the handles is pretty

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.850 
strength of the handles is pretty
sufficient<00:02:07.290> without<00:02:07.439> needing<00:02:08.129> those<00:02:08.399> inner

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
sufficient without needing those inner

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.420 
sufficient without needing those inner
liners<00:02:09.570> I've<00:02:10.570> had<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:10.869> knife<00:02:11.080> for<00:02:11.350> about<00:02:11.680> two

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
liners I've had this knife for about two

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.680 
liners I've had this knife for about two
and<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.670> half<00:02:12.850> years<00:02:13.060> almost<00:02:13.210> three<00:02:13.450> years<00:02:13.480> now

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
and a half years almost three years now

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.250 
and a half years almost three years now
and<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.980> never<00:02:15.700> gotten<00:02:16.210> any<00:02:16.360> major<00:02:16.660> marring

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and it's never gotten any major marring

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.680 
and it's never gotten any major marring
or<00:02:17.440> scratches<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:19.090> know<00:02:19.210> dents<00:02:19.480> or

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
or scratches or you know dents or

or scratches or you know dents or
anything<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.290> handles<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.680> I'm

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
anything like that in the handles so I'm

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.580 
anything like that in the handles so I'm
pretty<00:02:21.670> happy<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.180> most<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> damages

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
pretty happy with it most the damages

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.610 
pretty happy with it most the damages
actually<00:02:23.860> happened<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> clip<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.790> here

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
actually happened on the clip right here

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
actually happened on the clip right here
so<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.830> has<00:02:27.000> ambidextrous<00:02:28.000> thumb<00:02:28.030> studs<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
so it has ambidextrous thumb studs to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.540 
so it has ambidextrous thumb studs to
open<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.400> both<00:02:30.400> sides<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.820> those<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.800> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
open it so both sides have those and the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.660 
open it so both sides have those and the
lock<00:02:33.790> used<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:35.040> lock<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.190> open<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.490> what's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
lock used to lock it open is what's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.730 
lock used to lock it open is what's
called<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:37.270> clock<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.380> saws

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
called our clock and that saws

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.940 
called our clock and that saws
proprietary<00:02:39.550> locking<00:02:40.030> system<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.620> when

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
proprietary locking system and so when

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.300 
proprietary locking system and so when
you<00:02:42.070> close<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.870> flick<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.990> open<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.770> will<00:02:45.070> lock

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
you close it flick it open it will lock

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.820 
you close it flick it open it will lock
using<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.030> little<00:02:46.330> stud<00:02:46.570> right<00:02:46.780> here<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
using this little stud right here and to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.830 
using this little stud right here and to
close<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.310> will<00:02:48.520> pull<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.730> back<00:02:49.239> like<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
close it you will pull it back like that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.620 
close it you will pull it back like that
if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:52.030> obviously

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
if you can see that and it obviously

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.330 
if you can see that and it obviously
goes<00:02:53.140> in<00:02:53.290> an<00:02:53.380> arc<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.860> that's<00:02:54.010> why<00:02:54.100> they<00:02:54.190> call

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
goes in an arc so that's why they call

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.430 
goes in an arc so that's why they call
the<00:02:54.489> arc<00:02:54.670> lock<00:02:54.940> go<00:02:55.360> figure

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
the arc lock go figure

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.500 
the arc lock go figure
the<00:02:56.650> our<00:02:56.800> clock<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.820> able<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.330> withstand

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
the our clock is with able to withstand

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.650 
the our clock is with able to withstand
up<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> thousand<00:03:00.280> pounds<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.760> pressure<00:03:01.000> is

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
up to a thousand pounds of pressure is

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.540 
up to a thousand pounds of pressure is
pretty<00:03:01.840> impressive<00:03:02.140> without<00:03:02.980> breaking<00:03:03.400> but

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
pretty impressive without breaking but

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.210 
pretty impressive without breaking but
that<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.850> according<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.360> SOG<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:06.100> know<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
that is according to SOG so you know I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.920 
that is according to SOG so you know I
wouldn't<00:03:06.489> recommend<00:03:06.910> going<00:03:07.090> out<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.510> testing

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
wouldn't recommend going out and testing

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.310 
wouldn't recommend going out and testing
that<00:03:08.050> tomorrow<00:03:08.440> though<00:03:09.330> now<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.390> clip<00:03:10.690> can<00:03:11.200> be

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
that tomorrow though now the clip can be

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.500 
that tomorrow though now the clip can be
moved<00:03:11.590> at<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.830> from<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.100> side<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.450> side

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
moved at it from this side to this side

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.539 
moved at it from this side to this side
and<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.019> got<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> little<00:03:14.620> recess<00:03:15.070> there<00:03:15.280> for

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
and it's got a little recess there for

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
very simple to take apart and very

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080 
very simple to take apart and very
simple<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.560> put<00:03:53.650> back<00:03:53.769> together<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.820> just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090

need<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.360> remember<00:03:55.720> all<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.110> parts<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:57.010> you

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
need to remember all the parts so if you

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.380 
need to remember all the parts so if you
lose<00:03:57.340> any<00:03:57.370> parts<00:03:57.850> you're<00:03:58.000> pretty<00:03:58.239> much

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
screwed the overall weight of this is

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.570 
screwed the overall weight of this is
four<00:04:01.989> point<00:04:02.260> three<00:04:02.530> ounces<00:04:02.560> now<00:04:03.220> there<00:04:03.430> are

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
four point three ounces now there are

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.789 
four point three ounces now there are
some<00:04:03.940> people<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:04.450> there<00:04:04.480> who<00:04:05.320> think<00:04:05.500> that

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
some people out there who think that

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.590 
some people out there who think that
that's<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.310> know<00:04:06.489> they're<00:04:06.940> neurotic<00:04:07.390> about

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
that's you know they're neurotic about

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.420 
that's you know they're neurotic about
weight<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.140> be<00:04:08.230> honest<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.130> think<00:04:09.310> all

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
weight to be honest and I think all

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.190 
weight to be honest and I think all
anything<00:04:09.670> over<00:04:09.940> four<00:04:10.180> ounces<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.660> ridiculous

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
anything over four ounces is ridiculous

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.170 
anything over four ounces is ridiculous
so<00:04:11.290> I'm<00:04:11.440> not<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:12.519> has<00:04:12.700> enough<00:04:12.940> half

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so I'm not really this has enough half

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.050 
so I'm not really this has enough half
that<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:14.739> comfortable<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.940> know

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
that it's it's comfortable it's you know

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.820 
that it's it's comfortable it's you know
not<00:04:16.239> an<00:04:16.390> axe<00:04:16.630> or<00:04:16.959> battle<00:04:17.349> axe<00:04:17.500> or<00:04:17.680> anything

I<00:05:43.930> was<00:05:44.020> trying<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.259> pry<00:05:44.500> something<00:05:44.949> not<00:05:45.130> even

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340

broke<00:05:48.039> right<00:05:48.430> around<00:05:48.729> here<00:05:49.240> just<00:05:49.870> not<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.349> tip

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
broke right around here just not the tip

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
right off and that was entirely

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.850 
right off and that was entirely
unacceptable<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.690> Kershaw's<00:05:56.469> yeah<00:05:56.680> you're
