00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 fed all guys are rich for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.609
 recent times on italy and we are here today 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 with the last episode of the bala road 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.490
 to argentino a perfect team obviously 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 among these four you chose mexico 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.719
 we will put in place of carlitos tevez e 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.719
 then helmet left back then I would say 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.180
 that our Argentine perfect with di 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.129
 bala has obviously been completed 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 they could put aguero you could 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 put so many other players though 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.219
 we decided together and therefore this is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 the definitive school then we go to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 playing the game this is really the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 game 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
 let's see how our behavior behaves 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.109
 definitive argentina 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.080
 here is the adversary 70 in agreement mother 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 mine is however ciao muller tox in attack 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 also boosted then i know about bugs 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.840
 that 56 bronze attacker is that muller 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 it's dangerous 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.580
 Incredible stake oh I didn't understand one 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.100
 bat 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.360
 I just know he took an incredible stake 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.790
 muller so I said it was 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.400
 dangerous but let's try to leave go 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.200
 I'm not from bala talentino 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.590
 managed to return but how much they are 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.759
 my bad midfielders here though 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 they are also assholes because they lose the ball 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.250
 no no no no no like this with skis 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.520
 it doesn't make me understand anything but it freed itself 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.149
 hyper was lost pereira put that you do 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.160
 to anticipate 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.590
 this dangerous is not understood 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.140
 ball in the middle but there is cavaliero go by 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.239
 bala exchanges with put messes it back to him 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.830
 and there is only bala in front of the goalkeeper 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.510
 ca n't go wrong with bala 1 to 0 to 22 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.790
 sure i said he couldn't be wrong 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.489
 but what chocolates he gave him 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.300
 let's review the bale launch beautifully 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.200
 in front of the goalie precise and marks 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.769
 also in the last game of the series of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.750
 bar ap a phenomenon assumed omitted 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:39.230
 he kept putting a nice ball back and he goes 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.840
 to put and bring back my helmet 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.709
 centrally sees lionel put that if of it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.959
 goes to put put curse put 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.390
 badly put badly cavalier 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.180
 mow striker don't tell me it arrives 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.340
 red but I really think so ah no it is 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.549
 punishment still in place 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.739
 dangerous attention pay attention to 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.769
 this punishment because it could do us 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.150
 of evil 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.970
 eye here mammamia cavaliero that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.180
 goalkeeper and helmet for wide era 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.280
 for helmet helmet he always my mom but 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.610
 that this helmet is out 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.850
 everything changes towards maria 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.620
 of maria find you enter it puts it in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.880
 half does not get there by bala for a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.420
 breath ande ride the parade and do 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.490
 share his pereira towards put that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.990
 he anticipates everyone and takes a lot, too 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.840
 do it now interpret this mine 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.580
 declaration please and end here 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 the first time 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.630
 race dominated at the level of possession but 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.670
 I attracted a lot of adversary 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.260
 say also lucky enough to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.050
 this view is perhaps it is there 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:11.930
 However, we try to win the latter 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:14.120
 game oddio ie boys we are in 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.880
 silence because I was so focused 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.669
 it's practically ours if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.919
 oh god but he enzo perez your 0 al 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.270
 fiftieth guys did a goal 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.030
 crazy head I did not expect 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.860
 it also arrived because it pereira like al 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.310
 he usually did a lot of work on that 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 band 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.260
 pereira man of the match coc di 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:43.070
 left guys is something 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:47.830
 awesome and 21 to 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.710
 64th curse motion 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.390
 confusing but is attracted by a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.890
 bag at the end so there can be 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.190
 without problems 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.750
 fabian delph signs the 2 1 65th 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.520
 let's try to defend at least this 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.380
 result considering that we are 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.600
 attacking more like before 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.380
 but from there we find the palate beautiful 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.380
 recovery 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.210
 2 to 2 to the seventy-eighth we say that 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.949
 in the end it is deserved because it was 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.770
 playing well but boosted muller 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.990
 guys how sinful you are because i 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.849
 two power plants were playing a lot 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.469
 they are very well taken care of 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.969
 and oh well 2 2 to 2 to 79 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:38.379
 let's try it is the hoax prank let's try to 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.889
 create something good from the kept 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.889
 helmet 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.649
 no there punishment attention 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.389
 danger here helmet no indeed you put me 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:52.360
 okay in the middle maybe we try to do 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:56.770
 head goals no one puts in the middle of 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:03.460
 I don't believe a panel was a blow 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:07.719
 safe from and to last goal you owe it 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.149
 make you from the 90th series 3 to 2 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.490
 practically the last goal of the series a 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.620
 a ninetieth the basic signature that is 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.099
 better than that the series could not 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.020
 to end 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.319
 I hope it is the last less than in recovery 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.389
 now it is necessary, however, it is precisely the 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:25.300
 the icing on the cake was his 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:30.009
 goal just in the final of my mother 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.080
 perfect left boom and ends here 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.199
 the game and also our series 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.699
 guys we win our argentina 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.039
 perfect wins this game 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:42.459
 very very hard indeed 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.649
 we have fun and no kids 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:47.110
 closed this series I'm very happy 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:49.809
 because anyway you enjoyed a casino 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.539
 bala perez and bala anchor 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.459
 our talentino who has us 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.979
 accompanied throughout the series 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:07:00.159
 closes and at the end a game that 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.559
 maybe I didn't completely deserve why 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:05.080
 see 15 shots on goal I only 7 the 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:07.029
 possession there is but okay nothing 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.589
 guys the series ends here left 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.839

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:14.399
