as far as the product itself it's a
little<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.730> combination<00:00:39.210> protein<00:00:39.930> a

little bit of a combination protein a
blended<00:00:40.739> protein<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.390> way

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
blended protein if you will it's got way

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470 
blended protein if you will it's got way
from<00:00:43.260> whey<00:00:43.710> protein<00:00:44.129> concentrate<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:45.030> well<00:00:45.059> as

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
from whey protein concentrate as well as

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
from whey protein concentrate as well as
a<00:00:45.510> whey<00:00:45.840> protein<00:00:45.870> isolate<00:00:46.769> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.730> not

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
a whey protein isolate so you have not

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
a whey protein isolate so you have not
only<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.170> cheaper<00:00:49.590> version

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
only like the little bit cheaper version

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
only like the little bit cheaper version
of<00:00:50.039> whey<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> concentrate<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> also

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
of whey in the concentrate but you also

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.770 
of whey in the concentrate but you also
have<00:00:52.109> a<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.800> high<00:00:53.070> quality<00:00:53.129> whey<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
have a really high quality whey and the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
have a really high quality whey and the
ice<00:00:54.960> list<00:00:55.350> something<00:00:55.590> that's<00:00:55.859> gone<00:00:56.070> through<00:00:56.429> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ice list something that's gone through a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
ice list something that's gone through a
few<00:00:56.609> processes<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.629> remove<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.589> only<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
few processes to remove not only the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.689 
few processes to remove not only the
lactose<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.320> fats

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
lactose that's in it but also the fats

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.189 
lactose that's in it but also the fats
and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.120> top<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.899> milk

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and then on top of that you have milk

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.740 
and then on top of that you have milk
protein<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.570> be

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
protein in here which is going to be

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
protein in here which is going to be
about<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.470> 80%<00:01:08.570> casein<00:01:09.570> combination<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.680> 20%

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
about an 80% casein combination with 20%

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
about an 80% casein combination with 20%
way<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
way so you have a little bit of the the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190 
way so you have a little bit of the the
medium<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> faster<00:01:15.000> digesting<00:01:15.659> proteins

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
medium and and faster digesting proteins

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.280 
medium and and faster digesting proteins
in<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.390> blended<00:01:18.990> protein

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
in there all in all as a blended protein

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
in there all in all as a blended protein
it's<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:20.280> only<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.579> to<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.700> great<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.299> take

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it's not only going to be great to take

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.139 
it's not only going to be great to take
several<00:01:22.350> times<00:01:22.710> throughout<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> day<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
several times throughout the day but

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.999 
several times throughout the day but
else<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> wallet<00:01:25.710> it's

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
else also really good on the wallet it's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
else also really good on the wallet it's
a<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.579> very<00:01:27.119> price<00:01:27.390> effective

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a very very price effective

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980 
a very very price effective
cost-effective<00:01:28.979> protein<00:01:29.840> basically<00:01:30.840> what

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
cost-effective protein basically what

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.270 
cost-effective protein basically what
you're<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.500> getting<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> something

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you're going to be getting is something

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.670 
you're going to be getting is something
that<00:01:32.549> combines<00:01:32.970> fast<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> slow<00:01:34.110> digesting

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that combines fast and slow digesting

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.440 
that combines fast and slow digesting
proteins<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> end<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> end<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.329> with

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
proteins so in the end you end up with

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
proteins so in the end you end up with
some<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.780> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> medium<00:01:37.740> range

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
some we're kind of in the medium range

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.389 
some we're kind of in the medium range
there<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.430> digesting<00:01:39.119> an<00:01:39.240> hour<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:40.399> not

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
there for digesting an hour to two not

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.069 
there for digesting an hour to two not
quite<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> fast<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.149> way<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.630> nearly<00:01:42.899> as

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
quite as fast as way but not nearly as

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
quite as fast as way but not nearly as
slow<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.380> casein<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.950> well<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:45.000> nice<00:01:45.119> thing

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
slow as casein as well the nice thing

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.209 
slow as casein as well the nice thing
about<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.590> combine<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
about this is when you do combine the

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.580 
about this is when you do combine the
two<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.030> end<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:48.719> of<00:01:48.750> leucine<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
two you end up with a lot of leucine the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
two you end up with a lot of leucine the
amino<00:01:49.860> acid<00:01:50.280> leucine<00:01:50.399> from<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.969> whey<00:01:51.149> which

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
amino acid leucine from the whey which

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.779 
amino acid leucine from the whey which
is<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.369> protein

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
is going to really be good for protein

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.310 
is going to really be good for protein
synthesis<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.780> combine<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.140> with

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
synthesis so when you combine it with
