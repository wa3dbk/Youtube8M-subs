 Chopped tomato 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.110
 rice a little bit of saffron salt and some 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.210
 cut lemons 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.210
 plus a little bit of boiling broth 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.840
 we put the paella pan on the fire 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.840
 we add the oil 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.620
 we let warm a little 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.620
 and we add 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.659
 once sautÃ©ed without being colored 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.659
 we incorporate 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 the onion 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.530
 and we add the green pepper 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.280
 approximately we have to water between 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.520
 3 and 5 minutes 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.670
 we incorporate the cauliflower 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.050
 we have previously cut in 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.410
 little bunches 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.810
 the cauliflower does not need to do it look 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.460
 the error the rice with the broth 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.870
 that will cook us and we will leave 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 together we incorporate the tomato 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.460
 we have peeled and chopped 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.990
 once renovated 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.479
 let's incorporate the rice 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.090
 the rice always and the broth have to 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 measure yourself then look I use the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.810
 castle 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.270
 reason 6 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 per person then then I'll have to 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 add double the broth 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.569
 and I steal it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.550
 whole once the rice is cooked 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.190
 to throw the broth 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.580
 the broth that we have it very hot or 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.730
 We are going to add boiling 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 a little bit of saffron I like 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.799
 add only on branch to make it look 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.980
 and we are going to add it to the paella so that 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.980
 serve us very strong seasoned 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.920
 rice always has to be a 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.980
 little bit pointing to salt be 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.620
 a little bit tasty do not forget 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.750
 that rice is a sponge that is going to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.090
 absorb all the flavors that you 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.130
 let's have strong fire 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.190
 boiling 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.270
 very strong 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.310
 we will have it approximately 5000 meters 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:17.070
 then we will lower the fire and we will have it 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.070
 approximately another 10 minutes more 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.600
 that we could also put it in the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.880
 we add the rosemary that will give you a 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.710
 flavor to the important rice 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.700
 Y 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.070
 we decorate it with a little bit of peppers 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.540
 Reds cover with paper albal Temos 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.620
 chopped up 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.510
 so that the rice is made on top of us 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.530
 and so we keep it for 10 minutes 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.519
 approximately elapsed time 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.519
 we uncover the albal paper 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.240
 and placed some little squares around 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.300
 some lemons that we have lowered until the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.580
 half of the lemon to be able to place them in 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.580
 the edge of the paella pan 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.040
 and I have the paella
