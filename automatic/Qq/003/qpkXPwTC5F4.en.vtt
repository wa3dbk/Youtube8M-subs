00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.820 

we're<00:00:26.660> progressing<00:00:28.730> pretty<00:00:29.730> good<00:00:29.970> since<00:00:30.830> day

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830

we're progressing pretty good since day
one<00:00:32.160> basically<00:00:36.079> most<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> nail<00:00:37.590> has<00:00:37.890> come

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one basically most of the nail has come

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.930 
one basically most of the nail has come
off<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.739> guess<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> underneath<00:00:41.670> layer

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
off this is I guess the underneath layer

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
off this is I guess the underneath layer
of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> toenail<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:49.760> couple<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of the toenail and just a couple of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
of the toenail and just a couple of
pieces<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:55.910> couple<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> pieces<00:00:57.390> that<00:01:00.739> basically

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pieces a couple of pieces that basically

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
pieces a couple of pieces that basically
a<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> left<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a little bit is left and now it's a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
a little bit is left and now it's a
little<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.150> sort<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> feel<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> little

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
little bit I can sort of feel a little

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
little bit I can sort of feel a little
bit<00:01:10.820> like<00:01:12.049> when<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.200> touching<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.220> feel

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
bit like when I'm touching it I can feel

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:35.980 
bit like when I'm touching it I can feel
a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.790> softness<00:01:17.790> there

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
treatment to see if that you know

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.170 
treatment to see if that you know
penetrates<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.440> nail<00:01:55.710> bed<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
penetrates now into the nail bed and if

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.330 
penetrates now into the nail bed and if
the<00:01:57.300> nail<00:01:57.510> will<00:01:57.780> grow<00:01:58.080> out<00:01:58.970> healthy<00:01:59.970> again<00:02:00.300> so

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
the nail will grow out healthy again so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.130 
the nail will grow out healthy again so
as<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.550> can<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.760> not<00:02:03.120> too<00:02:03.360> much<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.990> know<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
as you can see not too much you know a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.000 
as you can see not too much you know a
little<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:06.320> whatever<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> left<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
little bit of whatever is left of the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.480 
little bit of whatever is left of the
toenail<00:02:08.460> seems<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.000> scraping<00:02:09.480> off<00:02:09.660> but

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
toenail seems to be scraping off but

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.330 
toenail seems to be scraping off but
pretty<00:02:11.490> much<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.190> can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
pretty much and just so just so you can

pretty much and just so just so you can
see<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> difference<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.890> gonna<00:02:17.100> bring<00:02:17.370> my

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
see the difference I'm gonna bring my

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.790 
see the difference I'm gonna bring my
healthy<00:02:18.060> toenail<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
healthy toenail in but you can see the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680 
healthy toenail in but you can see the
difference<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.910> know<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> toenail<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
difference like you know the toenail is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.820 
difference like you know the toenail is
pretty<00:02:24.900> much<00:02:25.460> pretty<00:02:26.460> much<00:02:26.670> gone<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:33.830> there's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
pretty much pretty much gone so there's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.460 
pretty much pretty much gone so there's
quite<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> big<00:02:35.580> difference<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:36.230> anyways

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
quite a big difference there anyways

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
quite a big difference there anyways
so<00:02:37.739> we'll<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.160> progress<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so we'll just progress like this for the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.460 
so we'll just progress like this for the
next<00:02:39.840> couple<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.470> days<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.989> see<00:02:42.989> if<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.350> know
