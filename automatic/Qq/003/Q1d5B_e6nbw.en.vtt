problems that I experienced when I began

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.819 
problems that I experienced when I began
developing<00:01:37.700> online<00:01:37.850> modules<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.469> had

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
developing online modules is that I had

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.980 
developing online modules is that I had
this<00:01:40.039> vision<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.700> someone<00:01:41.359> was<00:01:41.539> going<00:01:41.719> to<00:01:41.810> be

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
this vision that someone was going to be

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.980 
this vision that someone was going to be
looking<00:01:42.259> over<00:01:42.380> my<00:01:42.530> shoulder<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.990> measuring

looking over my shoulder and measuring

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.349 
looking over my shoulder and measuring
what<00:01:45.319> I'm<00:01:45.439> having<00:01:45.829> my<00:01:45.950> students<00:01:46.369> do<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.789> kind

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
what I'm having my students do that kind

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.940 
what I'm having my students do that kind
of<00:01:47.420> concern<00:01:47.810> rarely<00:01:48.319> occurs<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:48.859> a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of concern rarely occurs in a

of concern rarely occurs in a
conventional<00:01:49.549> class<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.659> the

is and my colleagues are off doing
something<00:01:56.539> else<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.079> if<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.560> going<00:01:57.799> to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
something else but if this is going to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.669 
something else but if this is going to
be<00:01:58.009> broadcast<00:01:58.670> online<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.959> president<00:02:00.499> of<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
be broadcast online the president of the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.590 
be broadcast online the president of the
university<00:02:01.249> can<00:02:01.429> watch<00:02:01.639> it<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:01.999> see<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:02.479> I'm

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
university can watch it and see what I'm

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.929 
university can watch it and see what I'm
doing<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.139> so<00:02:03.350> there<00:02:04.249> was<00:02:04.369> an<00:02:04.490> initial

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
doing and so there was an initial

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.300 
doing and so there was an initial
tendency<00:02:05.450> for<00:02:05.630> me<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.929> overload<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:07.009> class

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
tendency for me to overload the class
