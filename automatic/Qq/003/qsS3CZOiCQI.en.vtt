hair because interlocking this stays and
way<00:04:42.680> longer<00:04:43.639> than<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:44.449> know<00:04:44.599> a<00:04:44.629> regular<00:04:44.930> reach

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
way longer than you know a regular reach

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.929 
way longer than you know a regular reach
was<00:04:45.499> done<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.159> I'm<00:04:46.279> really<00:04:46.460> looking<00:04:46.639> at<00:04:46.879> that

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
was done so I'm really looking at that

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:53.200 
was done so I'm really looking at that
and<00:04:50.020> I'm<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.259> really<00:04:51.529> looking<00:04:51.650> at<00:04:51.919> that<00:04:52.210> and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
and I'm just really looking at that and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.929 
and I'm just really looking at that and
I<00:04:53.689> think<00:04:53.930> that'd<00:04:54.080> be<00:04:54.259> a<00:04:54.289> good<00:04:54.529> look<00:04:54.909> plus<00:04:55.909> I

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
I think that'd be a good look plus I

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.969 
I think that'd be a good look plus I
mean<00:04:56.210> it's<00:04:56.360> only<00:04:56.419> two<00:04:56.719> rows<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.379> you<00:04:57.740> know<00:04:57.860> it

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
mean it's only two rows so you know it

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.559 
mean it's only two rows so you know it
ain't<00:04:58.099> too<00:04:58.279> much<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.610> worry<00:04:58.729> about<00:04:58.789> but<00:04:59.120> I

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
ain't too much to worry about but I

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:00.999 
ain't too much to worry about but I
don't<00:04:59.689> think<00:04:59.960> I'll<00:05:00.139> enter<00:05:00.500> like<00:05:00.650> my<00:05:00.800> whole
