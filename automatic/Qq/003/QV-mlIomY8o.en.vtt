to<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.860> think<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.310> need<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:48.969> do<00:01:49.270> so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to you I think you need to do so

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.090 
to you I think you need to do so
literally<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.409> what<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.799> do
