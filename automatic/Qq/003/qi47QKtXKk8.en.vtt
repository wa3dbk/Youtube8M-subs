okay<00:00:01.950> John<00:00:02.219> I've<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.179> done<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> mock-up<00:00:03.719> of

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:03.989 
okay John I've just done a mock-up of

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.910 
okay John I've just done a mock-up of
the<00:00:05.210> start<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.300> Bendix<00:00:06.630> to<00:00:06.900> start<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> drive<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
the start of Bendix to start a drive and

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.590 
the start of Bendix to start a drive and
stuff<00:00:08.100> it<00:00:08.280> looks<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.490> bit<00:00:08.519> crappy<00:00:09.180> but<00:00:09.360> I'm<00:00:09.420> just

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
stuff it looks a bit crappy but I'm just

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.860 
stuff it looks a bit crappy but I'm just
getting<00:00:10.170> distances<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.980> lengths<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
getting distances and lengths and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.470 
getting distances and lengths and
dimensions<00:00:12.870> etc<00:00:13.700> as<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.940> see<00:00:15.120> there<00:00:15.330> this

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
dimensions etc as you can see there this

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.680 
dimensions etc as you can see there this
is<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.400> Bendix<00:00:17.400> Drive<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.360> starter

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
is the Bendix Drive on the starter

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:31.970 
is the Bendix Drive on the starter
itself<00:00:27.080> wiring<00:00:28.580> my<00:00:29.580> 150<00:00:30.060> amp<00:00:30.210> controller<00:00:30.980> I've

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
itself wiring my 150 amp controller I've

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470 
itself wiring my 150 amp controller I've
got<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> four<00:00:32.520> cell<00:00:32.759> battery<00:00:33.120> hanging<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
got a four cell battery hanging off it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.220 
got a four cell battery hanging off it
at<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> moment<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:36.090> servo<00:00:36.600> tester<00:00:36.840> just

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
at the moment and a servo tester just

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.400 
at the moment and a servo tester just
for<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> throttle<00:00:38.420> okay<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.140> I'll<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
for a throttle okay so what I'll do is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
for a throttle okay so what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:40.530> arm<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> oh<00:00:42.110> by<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.140> way<00:00:43.260> there's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I'll arm up the oh by the way there's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.850 
I'll arm up the oh by the way there's
the<00:00:43.850> afterburner<00:00:44.850> switch<00:00:45.260> just<00:00:46.260> face<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the afterburner switch just face just a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
the afterburner switch just face just a
momentary<00:00:47.219> switch<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.969> works<00:00:51.210> nicely<00:00:51.620> as

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
momentary switch so that works nicely as

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.940 
momentary switch so that works nicely as
you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> light<00:00:53.820> comes<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.710> well<00:00:55.710> push

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
you can see it light comes on well push

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.440 
you can see it light comes on well push
it<00:00:56.100> obviously<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.820> armed<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> cuz<00:00:57.329> we've

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
it obviously it's not armed it cuz we've

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.260 
it obviously it's not armed it cuz we've
got<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.629> PT<00:00:57.960> pressure<00:00:58.550> that's<00:00:59.550> I'll<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
got my PT pressure that's I'll just

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.130 
got my PT pressure that's I'll just
flick<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.739> oil<00:01:01.739> pressure<00:01:02.010> switch

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.410 

well<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.980> know<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> um

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:02:15.060 

and<00:01:12.660> controller<00:01:14.000> here

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.880 

and<00:02:16.780> here<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.020> little<00:02:18.140> laser<00:02:18.440> check<00:02:18.740> out

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
and here is that little laser check out

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.430 
and here is that little laser check out
a<00:02:18.920> little<00:02:19.100> tiny<00:02:19.310> bit<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.760> insufficient<00:02:20.570> I'm

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
a little tiny bit of insufficient I'm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.840 
a little tiny bit of insufficient I'm
just<00:02:21.650> gonna<00:02:21.770> make<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.190> even<00:02:22.400> slower<00:02:22.580> than

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
just gonna make up that even slower than

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.430 
just gonna make up that even slower than
when<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.210> started<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:26.110> that's<00:02:27.110> pretty<00:02:27.260> much

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
when it started but that's pretty much

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.690 
when it started but that's pretty much
it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.890 

that<00:02:31.700> noise<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.180> hear<00:02:32.210> there<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.810> a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
that noise you can hear there is just a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.260 
that noise you can hear there is just a
fame<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.350> controller<00:02:33.740> happening<00:02:34.270> I'll

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
fame on the controller happening I'll

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.860 
fame on the controller happening I'll
just<00:02:35.450> wipe<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.840> off<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.450> that's<00:02:38.630> pretty<00:02:38.780> much

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
just wipe it off and that's pretty much

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.200 
just wipe it off and that's pretty much
it<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:40.400> she'll<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.700> pretty

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
it so I think she'll be pretty

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.900 
it so I think she'll be pretty
successful<00:02:41.890> I'll<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.070> make<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.430> proper<00:02:43.790> me

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
successful I'll just make up a proper me

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.660 
successful I'll just make up a proper me
out<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.450> we<00:02:44.870> should<00:02:45.050> be<00:02:45.110> good<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.350> go

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
out for it and we should be good to go

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670 
out for it and we should be good to go
