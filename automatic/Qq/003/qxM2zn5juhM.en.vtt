00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi to you friends and today I 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 presents you with a recipe that has been 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.919
 asked by so many people this is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.510
 that of mns 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240
 so I wish you all a good 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.780
 watching we will need a blank 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 of egg 200 g of salted peanuts 230 g 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.230
 icing sugar 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.369
 a bar of milk chocolate and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.529
 food coloring 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 the first step is to melt 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.760
 microwave chocolate 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 once the chocolate is melted you go 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 take some peanuts and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 put in the chocolate you mix 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 well and then you go out a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 by one and puts them on a plate 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.329
 that's the result so it's more 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 very nice 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.350
 and then now you will do well 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.350
 harden the chocolate by setting the plate 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 in the fridge for an hour after 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.120
 an hour in the fridge the mnm are 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 now very hard so already here I'm going 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 show you a little bit about that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 looks so here and there you can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 already simply snack wow 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.989
 you are going to make a frosting so you 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 go mix the icing sugar with the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.409
 glander here is the dough that you go 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.820
 get it is very thick and I 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
 will divide it into four 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 you will then add the dye 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
 so it's about 5 drops not more 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 because otherwise the dough would become too 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.979
 liquid 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 here are the different colors and I 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 find it directly very pretty so 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 to color it's very simple you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.920
 go put some mnm sedan the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 dye you're going to surround them well 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.820
 we will then know and put it on 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.350
 a plate 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.270
 this is the result they are already very 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 pretty and here we go masters 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 for an hour in the freezer 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 this is the result after one to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.049
 freezer but what I you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
 advise is still to do them 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.299
 to dry at least one night or 24 hours 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 for the coop well last night well 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 crunchy 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 I was immediately reminded of the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.560

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 well fluo it's gone waouh 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 at the level of taste it's just amazing 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.369
 because we really have the same texture 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.319
