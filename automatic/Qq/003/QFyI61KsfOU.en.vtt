stationary studs in the heads with then

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.030 
stationary studs in the heads with then
we'll<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:50.630> locking<00:02:50.930> nuts<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.590> will<00:02:51.740> attach

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
we'll have locking nuts that will attach

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.290 
we'll have locking nuts that will attach
to<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:53.540> he's<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> really<00:02:54.140> good<00:02:54.290> setup<00:02:54.650> here

to this he's a really good setup here
did<00:02:56.300> get<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.510> carburetor<00:02:57.020> on<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.590> to

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
did get the carburetor on to get to

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.080 
did get the carburetor on to get to
breathe<00:02:57.920> their<00:02:58.100> own<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.640> lines<00:02:58.850> are

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
breathe their own all the lines are

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.040 
breathe their own all the lines are
hooked<00:02:59.300> up<00:03:00.610> we're<00:03:01.610> about<00:03:01.790> ready<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.240> do<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
hooked up we're about ready to do the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.800 
hooked up we're about ready to do the
front<00:03:03.350> end<00:03:03.530> into<00:03:03.709> wiring<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:07.510> think<00:03:08.510> maybe

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
front end into wiring so I think maybe

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.670 
front end into wiring so I think maybe
we<00:03:08.959> should<00:03:08.990> have<00:03:09.320> some<00:03:09.590> wine

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
we should have some wine

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.250 
we should have some wine
going<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.849> here<00:03:12.209> shortly

breather<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.539> motor<00:04:21.830> needs<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:23.010> crankcase

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
breather this motor needs a crankcase

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.550 
breather this motor needs a crankcase
breather<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.000> we're<00:04:24.270> using<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.690> special<00:04:24.720> set<00:04:25.410> up

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
breather so we're using a special set up

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.379 
breather so we're using a special set up
that<00:04:25.740> we<00:04:25.830> fabricated<00:04:26.460> here<00:04:26.820> works<00:04:27.090> real<00:04:27.360> well

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
that we fabricated here works real well

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.409 
that we fabricated here works real well
it<00:04:28.169> also<00:04:28.289> has<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> drain<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.669> bottom<00:04:30.210> for

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it also has a drain in the bottom for

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.440 
it also has a drain in the bottom for
any<00:04:30.570> excess<00:04:31.139> blow<00:04:31.620> by<00:04:31.880> events<00:04:32.880> really<00:04:33.150> nice

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
any excess blow by events really nice

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.810 
any excess blow by events really nice
this<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.110> very<00:04:34.380> high-performance<00:04:35.280> set<00:04:35.669> up

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
this is very high-performance set up

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.740 
this is very high-performance set up
here<00:04:36.680> on<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.460> oil<00:04:38.610> filter<00:04:39.090> here<00:04:39.539> we're

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
here on the on the oil filter here we're

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.460 
here on the on the oil filter here we're
also<00:04:39.870> using<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:41.210> washable<00:04:42.210> top<00:04:42.599> screen<00:04:43.110> filter

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
also using a washable top screen filter

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.810 
also using a washable top screen filter
in<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.010> with<00:04:44.820> less<00:04:45.060> restrictive<00:04:45.780> oil<00:04:46.520> flow<00:04:47.520> I

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
in this with less restrictive oil flow I

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.420 
in this with less restrictive oil flow I
mean<00:04:48.150> has<00:04:48.300> more<00:04:48.599> oil<00:04:49.199> flow<00:04:49.620> which<00:04:49.800> it's<00:04:50.130> less

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
mean has more oil flow which it's less

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.110 
mean has more oil flow which it's less
restrictive<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:52.010> being<00:04:53.010> less<00:04:53.190> restrictive<00:04:53.849> it

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
restrictive so being less restrictive it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.020 
restrictive so being less restrictive it
has<00:04:54.449> more<00:04:54.690> all<00:04:54.930> oil<00:04:55.500> flow<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:57.000> engine

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
has more all oil flow to the engine

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.960 
has more all oil flow to the engine
hopefully<00:04:57.770> now<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.979> really<00:04:59.190> does<00:04:59.460> their<00:04:59.789> work

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
hopefully now it really does their work

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.240 
hopefully now it really does their work
real<00:05:00.240> well<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:01.470> notice<00:05:01.710> we<00:05:01.830> are<00:05:01.979> using

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
real well you notice we are using

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.879 
real well you notice we are using
braided<00:05:02.639> steel<00:05:03.000> lines<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:03.810> as<00:05:04.080> well<00:05:04.710> as

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
braided steel lines on this as well as

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.000 
braided steel lines on this as well as
all<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.300> trick<00:05:06.300> fittings<00:05:06.810> here<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.680> we<00:05:07.800> don't

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
all the trick fittings here so we don't

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.420 
all the trick fittings here so we don't
have<00:05:08.099> any<00:05:08.370> Oh<00:05:08.610> leaks<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.800> little<00:05:10.800> closer<00:05:11.070> look

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
have any Oh leaks a little closer look

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.510 
have any Oh leaks a little closer look
at<00:05:11.699> some<00:05:12.479> of<00:05:12.539> this

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
at some of this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.520 
at some of this
we've<00:05:15.520> also<00:05:15.699> mounted<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:17.020> single-sided

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
we've also mounted the single-sided

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.439 
we've also mounted the single-sided
swingarm<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.990> we<00:05:19.990> were<00:05:20.169> getting<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.710> land<00:05:21.039> up

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
swingarm and we were getting it land up

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.899 
swingarm and we were getting it land up
perfect<00:05:22.449> with<00:05:22.629> the<00:05:22.780> transmission<00:05:23.699> at<00:05:24.699> this

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
perfect with the transmission at this

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.869 
perfect with the transmission at this
point<00:05:25.240> we've<00:05:25.539> got<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.830> good<00:05:26.830> alignment<00:05:27.430> with<00:05:27.849> it

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
point we've got a good alignment with it

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:32.029 
point we've got a good alignment with it
you<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.330> actually<00:05:28.960> see<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:30.120> sprocket<00:05:31.120> here

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
you can actually see the sprocket here

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:39.230 
you can actually see the sprocket here
land<00:05:33.039> up<00:05:33.370> with<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.970> transmission<00:05:35.639> sprocket

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.820 

it's<00:05:40.240> very<00:05:40.479> heavy<00:05:40.840> duty<00:05:41.289> unit<00:05:43.680> next<00:05:44.680> we

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
it's very heavy duty unit next we

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.589 
it's very heavy duty unit next we
mounting<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.400> shocks<00:05:46.259> and<00:05:47.849> then<00:05:48.849> up<00:05:49.060> next<00:05:49.150> I

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
mounting the shocks and then up next I

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.059 
mounting the shocks and then up next I
guess<00:05:49.900> then<00:05:50.110> we'll<00:05:50.469> probably<00:05:50.590> take<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.889> break

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
guess then we'll probably take a break

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.589 
guess then we'll probably take a break
today<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.759> mount<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.060> front<00:05:52.300> end<00:05:52.479> tomorrow
