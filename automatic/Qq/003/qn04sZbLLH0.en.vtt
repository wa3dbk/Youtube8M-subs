00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
then I have to stand around after I

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.999 
then I have to stand around after I
fabricated<00:01:42.509> each<00:01:42.720> piece<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.470> make

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
fabricated each piece and then make

00:01:44.009 --> 00:02:02.770 
fabricated each piece and then make
sausage

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780
