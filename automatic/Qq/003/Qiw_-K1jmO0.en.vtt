00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 how did it go jean marie this 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.130
 intervention very fast intervention 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.200
 that is, committed properly 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.650
 these cases there in fact the patient had been 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 supported by the smur of saverne 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 so totally conditioned treated and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 we're just doing the part 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 transport so that's where we win the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 more in terms of time and so there we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 adds the two southerners 12 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.420
 minutes of flight to arrive at a service 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.420
 specialized in strasbourg 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.280
 so we have the advantage of having a patient 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.480
 who is used to sensors 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.280
 apparently this is not the first 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.810
 time he has a problem otherwise in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.370
 do we explain to them a little bit that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.140
 it does not go much in principle 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.750
 but it's noisy and we do not 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.610
 can hardly communicate so often they 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.350
 have they hurt or whatever else they are 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.210
 simply ask to make a sign of 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 arm we almost do not talk to each other 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.130
 here you have seen some pictures 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.320
 an intervention with this group 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.700
 this helicopter jean-marie we will do 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.950
 a small assessment starts how are you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 run oliver took the call there 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.800
 had an emergency call 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.020
 what did you have at that moment 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.509
 as information the only information 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 that we have at this stage there is a 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.920
 man in his thirties who has a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.630
 chest pain a place 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.380
 relatively far from Strasbourg 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 drulingen 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.869
 this is announced enough has been enough for us 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.520
 for to start the intervention well 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.229
 that the vital prognosis of this man there 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.130
 can be engaged already ie 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.979
 that you have to go very fast 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.869
 this one of the pathologies or the time 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.009
 count a lot and it takes in a 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.140
 first time on the spot have a 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.100
 diagnosis the first treatment and 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.830
 then be able to go very quickly 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.539
 to a specialized cardiology center 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.229
 in this case once in 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.840
 the helicopter 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.940
 how is it going then we monitor 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.530
 the patient with a number 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.690
 of devices a scop cardio there in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.239
 the occurrence to have the frequency 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.430
 heart rate the tension the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.930
 oxygen saturation according to the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.190
 pathologies we can see patients 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.769
 who are under respirator 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.180
 we just talked very little with the patient 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.900
 it's relatively noisy so at 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.030
 departure, we explain to patients the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.290
 unfolding that will be in a mood 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.269
 relatively noisy your pace 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.100
 difficult to talk to each other and the duration of 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.989
 flight also so that they 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.560
 understand what will happen 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.579
 once you get here you are on the roof 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.040
 of the new civilian hospital 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.170
 you pass on to give you this patient 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.390
 advocate the war quite so we 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.549
 fate of the helicopter and there I redo 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.870
 cardiologist transmissions who who 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.549
 come to take care of it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 jean-pierre you who are broken at this 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.920
 type of exercise what is your role 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.890
 with olive tree in the helicopter did 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.319
 my work every day 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.690
 is to implement the machine 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.150
 in the morning so make sure to 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 the mechanical integrity of the set of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.980
 the machine and equipment including 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.900
 winch and after flight I attend 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.170
 pilots in the different phases of 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.330
 flight 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.030
 how's it going on the trail beat 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.540
 at work so the job is to 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.459
 get off the rescuers and the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.650
 doctors in this case once 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.660
 people his soil usually 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.550
 the helicopter will land on a point 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 okay the time to condition the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.230
 victim always safe 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.880
 assessment of this intervention it was not 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.440
 expected to do a real 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 interventions and here you have done 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.760
 your job finally today is 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.620
 absolutely since as my saying 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 colleague jean-pierre in the morning in 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.530
 arriving at the base we can have 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.390
 training predictions because these 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.640
 trainings are planned which are 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.890
 completely diverted to missions 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.180
 relief like that happened to us and 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.560
 that's what happens to us from time to time 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.290
 time is not going to stop us 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.970
 coach a little bit later but 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.230
 however, the relief is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.470
 always our priority mission 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.930
 this is an easy mission this morning for you 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.610
 the right tools nerves missions 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.680
 relatively simple to the extent that 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.840
 in the implementation of the helicopter 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.280
 there were simply takeoffs and 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 landings on land 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.290
 large enough not requiring neither 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.419
 winching operations and 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.310
 special provisions for laying 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.050
 in extremely confined places one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.669
 had seen in the press at one point or 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.890
 another that the bass could be 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.650
 threatened budgetary restrictions and 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.690
 finally the prefect stÃ©phane bouillon has 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.919
 announced that no it was rumors and 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.600
 that you would stay in place 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.970
 have you been worried and is 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.140
 what now you are reassured gold 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.360
 we had a little moment of 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.590
 floating but it only lasted very 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.870
 very little time to the extent that the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.410
 prefect reassured everyone by 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.270
 also press from our side on the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.000
 in terms of civil security we 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.950
 we also reassured 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.720
 and there is absolutely no need to 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.030
 think that this base where another base 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.070
 of civil security will close a small 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.900
 news news for you forty 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.060
 years garden of riffs what are you 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.680
 go winch jean-pierre and 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.660
 well listen absolutely yes the garden 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.970
 of both shores next sunday with 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.130
 presumably the good weather we 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.900
 will welcome the public who will 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.050
 come see us from 10 am and 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.210
 this until 7 pm so this Sunday and 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.440
 we will show the helicopter that will be 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.940
 posed in the garden of both banks 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.920
 there will be demonstrations of 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.620
 winching in the morning from 11 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.200
 hours in the afternoon from 16h there 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.770
 will also have a nice little side 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.970
 we will put a raffle in place where the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.010
 people will be able to earn baptisms from 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.690
 the air in plane 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.080
 thank you in any case to you three months I 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.150
 been blown away by the professionalism of the 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.890
 rigor of precision already this is in 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.400
 anyway here we were delighted to do this 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.400
 little focus
