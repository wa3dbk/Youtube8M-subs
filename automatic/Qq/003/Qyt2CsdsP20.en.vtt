00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.370
 yum cookers 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.620
 very good to everyone today I bring you one 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.440
 pretty special recipe is homemade kebab 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.210
 of chicken with the homemade thing I mean 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.640
 that you will not know like that of the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.710
 that we go where they eat them normally is 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.740
 a kind of different flavor good 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.070
 The first thing we will do is crush two 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.140
 peeled garlic and add a good spray 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.080
 of oil when I say a good jet of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.650
 oil well about ten milliliters 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.430
 of oil a little something like this we will add this 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.350
 mixture of garlic and oil in a bowl and in the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.350
 goal we will be adding the rest of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.250
 ingredients to marinate the chicken by 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.890
 a side a little salt half lemon or 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.900
 one lemon less cheese as you want two 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.559
 teaspoons of vinegar and this in 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.809
 special 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.640
 russell is no longer a mixture of spices 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.530
 You can find it in supermarkets 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 specialized and even in 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.479
 normal supermarkets in some 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.210
 they sell so we'll throw a couple of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.180
 spoonfuls of russell hanud 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.659
 a little bit of pepper and we will remove it 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.659
 all 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.580
 good as I told you the russell 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.950
 hunt is a mixture of species I do not know if 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.600
 He pronounced it well but good you can 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.120
 find in places like you said 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.340
 specialized and you will see that they can have 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.540
 some variation from one site to another does not 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 they are not always the same species good 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.950
 On the other hand, we are going to cut two 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.240
 chicken breasts as you are watching 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.090
 here in a few strips of a thickness of half 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.980
 centimeter as much we will add them to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.280
 the mix we have made and the 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.290
 we will leave marinating around 24 hours 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.480
 If you want to leave only two hours 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.310
 you can leave only two hours what happens 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.740
 is that the more hours you have them 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.160
 more flavor will now take what we will do 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.899
 will be to place the one in one in one 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.550
 baking tray and underneath we will place 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.400
 plant paper more than anything so that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.640
 we stick the meat to the tray and what 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.060
 We will put in the oven for about 20 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.239
 minutes to about 160 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 degrees we're going to prevent the meat from 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.950
 dry it juicy 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.000
 on the other hand let's cut good in 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.670
 this occasion has cut onion tomato and 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.730
 lettuce that is what best goes with it 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 although low is simply cut it as 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.270
 you want me to cut the lettuce 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.610
 in strips because it's more comfortable at the time 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.280
 to fill the pita 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.770
 we add the chicken inside the pita and the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.790
 rest of ingredients and the touch 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.160
 personal 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.680
 good in personal touch is not the touch 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.830
 the sauce is the sauce 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.480
 tsatsiki and I am also pronouncing it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.040

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.480

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.940
