00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
you don't have any intention and you

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.700 
you don't have any intention and you
just<00:01:09.729> sort<00:01:09.969> of<00:01:10.030> go<00:01:10.210> blindly<00:01:10.750> from<00:01:11.079> day<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.320> day

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710

there's<00:01:12.549> no<00:01:12.789> way<00:01:12.969> to<00:01:13.200> appreciate<00:01:14.430> each<00:01:15.430> day's

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
there's no way to appreciate each day's

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's no way to appreciate each day's
it<00:01:16.329> comes<00:01:16.659> because<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.079> have<00:01:17.350> nothing<00:01:17.829> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it comes because you have nothing to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.230 
it comes because you have nothing to
feed<00:01:19.990> off<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.310> for<00:01:21.549> me<00:01:21.729> it's<00:01:21.969> been<00:01:22.090> very
