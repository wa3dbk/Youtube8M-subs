exercise I came up with one out to sort
of<00:00:21.029> piddling<00:00:21.300> around<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.660> kit<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of piddling around on the kit and you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.230 
of piddling around on the kit and you
can<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> group<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
can actually use this as a group is a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.080 
can actually use this as a group is a
bit<00:00:24.449> over<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> top<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.699> it's<00:00:26.699> definitely<00:00:26.849> got

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
bit over the top but it's definitely got

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
bit over the top but it's definitely got
like<00:00:27.240> an<00:00:27.330> underlying<00:00:27.779> pulse<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.470> going

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
like an underlying pulse or going

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.859 
like an underlying pulse or going
through<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> downbeat<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
through it would like a downbeat and a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
through it would like a downbeat and a
backbeat<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> garnish<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.570> lot

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
backbeat just a lot of garnish and a lot

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720

play it with some speed and some vigor
and<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.760> should<00:03:38.940> sound<00:03:39.090> pretty<00:03:39.330> good<00:03:39.420> there<00:03:39.810> we

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and it should sound pretty good there we

00:03:39.870 --> 00:04:12.650 
and it should sound pretty good there we
go<00:04:04.040> way<00:04:05.040> out<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:11.330> but<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.420> get<00:04:12.600> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
go way out of that one but you get the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.660 
go way out of that one but you get the
idea<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.799> said<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.100> not<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.430> might

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
idea so like I said it's not this might

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.490 
idea so like I said it's not this might
be<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> bit<00:04:14.940> over<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.329> top<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.630> use<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.260> at<00:04:16.440> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
be a bit over the top to use but at the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.509 
be a bit over the top to use but at the
same<00:04:16.680> time<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:16.979> can<00:04:17.070> use<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> really

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
same time you can use it as a really

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.800 
same time you can use it as a really
good<00:04:17.640> exercise<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.180> get<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.390> right<00:04:18.630> foot
