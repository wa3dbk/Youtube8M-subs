the<00:02:55.080> biggest<00:02:55.490> slot<00:02:58.459> but<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.940> not<00:03:00.090> so

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the biggest slot but this is not so

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.730 
the biggest slot but this is not so
tight<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.940> box<00:03:04.190> explains<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:06.740> the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
tight and the box explains that the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.300 
tight and the box explains that the
bristles<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.780> apply<00:03:10.560> pressure<00:03:11.040> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
bristles this has to apply pressure to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.120 
bristles this has to apply pressure to
the<00:03:11.520> bristles<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.240> make<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.540> dry<00:03:12.690> faster<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the bristles to make it dry faster so

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.360 
the bristles to make it dry faster so
it's<00:03:14.430> best<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.120> stick<00:03:15.810> your<00:03:15.990> brushes<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.770> a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
it's best to stick your brushes and a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's best to stick your brushes and a
slot<00:03:17.700> where<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.970> tight<00:03:21.660> as<00:03:22.050> tight<00:03:22.440> as

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
slot where it's really tight as tight as

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.580 
slot where it's really tight as tight as
possible<00:03:23.269> okay<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.630> sticking<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.320> right

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
possible okay so sticking it in right

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.270 
possible okay so sticking it in right
here<00:03:27.050> would<00:03:28.050> actually<00:03:28.110> help<00:03:28.650> dry<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
here would actually help dry the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.640 
here would actually help dry the
bristles<00:03:30.239> faster<00:03:31.280> okay<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.600> definitely<00:03:34.320> helps

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
bristles faster okay it definitely helps

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.020 
bristles faster okay it definitely helps

messes it up ok so this dry shake thing
is<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:42.009> much<00:05:42.219> better<00:05:42.460> than<00:05:42.699> these<00:05:42.940> little

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
is so much better than these little

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.580 
is so much better than these little
three<00:05:43.509> things<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:44.500> this<00:05:44.710> material<00:05:45.460> is<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:47.319> one

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
three things so this material is the one

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.059 
three things so this material is the one
that<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:48.190> um<00:05:49.050> it's<00:05:50.050> some<00:05:50.500> sort<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.740> special

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
that is um it's some sort of special

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.269 
that is um it's some sort of special
fabric<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.909> allows<00:05:52.659> water<00:05:53.020> evaporation<00:05:53.770> to

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279 
fabric that allows water evaporation to

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.990 
fabric that allows water evaporation to
help<00:05:54.610> dry<00:05:55.479> the<00:05:55.509> bristles<00:05:56.259> faster<00:05:57.009> but<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.849> me

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
help dry the bristles faster but to me

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.899 
help dry the bristles faster but to me
it<00:05:58.210> just<00:05:58.240> feels<00:05:58.659> like<00:05:58.810> elastic<00:05:59.620> ok<00:06:00.279> just<00:06:00.580> it's

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
it just feels like elastic ok just it's

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.749 
it just feels like elastic ok just it's
pretty<00:06:01.210> much<00:06:01.300> perfect<00:06:01.539> lastic<00:06:02.259> and<00:06:02.759> it's

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
pretty much perfect lastic and it's

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.540 
pretty much perfect lastic and it's
definitely<00:06:04.300> gonna<00:06:04.509> prolong<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.949> use<00:06:06.159> of<00:06:06.190> the

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
definitely gonna prolong the use of the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.519 
definitely gonna prolong the use of the
bristles<00:06:07.000> because<00:06:07.569> it's<00:06:07.840> gonna<00:06:07.960> be<00:06:08.169> shaped

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529
