okay<00:00:11.429> now<00:00:11.759> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.179> talk<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
okay now we're going to talk about the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.890 
okay now we're going to talk about the
idea<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.440> maximum<00:00:14.190> compression<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.570> need

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
idea of maximum compression now we need

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.529 
idea of maximum compression now we need
compression<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.710> body<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.250> play<00:00:17.539> all

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
compression in the body to play all

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.250 
compression in the body to play all
notes<00:00:19.100> but<00:00:20.100> there's<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> maximum<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.990> can

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
notes but there's a maximum that we can

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
notes but there's a maximum that we can
create<00:00:22.529> within<00:00:23.130> our<00:00:23.279> body<00:00:23.519> now<00:00:24.150> make<00:00:24.420> sure

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
create within our body now make sure

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.560 
create within our body now make sure

ago now all of these guys talk about
compression<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> body<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
compression in the body and I want you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
compression in the body and I want you
to<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.579> any<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> your

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to think about all of the any of your

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.200 
to think about all of the any of your
favorite<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.920> high<00:00:56.250> note<00:00:56.520> specialist

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
favorite the high note specialist

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.099 
favorite the high note specialist
players<00:00:57.829> there<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.390> limit<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.840> how<00:01:00.870> much

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
players there is a limit to how much

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.399 
players there is a limit to how much
compression<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.300> create<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
compression that you can create all of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.539 
compression that you can create all of
these<00:01:04.710> guys<00:01:05.510> they<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.810> only<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.280> much

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
these guys they can only do as much

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
these guys they can only do as much
compression<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> body<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.890> as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
compression in the body as I can and as

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
compression in the body as I can and as
what<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> cut-off

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
what you can because there's a cut-off

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.200 
what you can because there's a cut-off
point<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.979> try<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> compress<00:01:14.880> too

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
point where if you try and compress too

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.800 
point where if you try and compress too
hard<00:01:15.830> your<00:01:16.880> muscles<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.030> start<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> split

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
hard your muscles will start and split

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.160 
hard your muscles will start and split
so<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.280> brain<00:01:20.580> says<00:01:20.970> no<00:01:21.000> that's<00:01:21.630> enough<00:01:21.990> now

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so the brain says no that's enough now

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.899 
so the brain says no that's enough now
sometime<00:01:22.619> people<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.280> force<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
sometime people really force it and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.160 
sometime people really force it and
there's<00:01:24.659> stories<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.290> blowing<00:01:25.530> throats<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
there's stories of blowing throats and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
there's stories of blowing throats and
hernias<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.590> sort<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> thing<00:01:29.009> which

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
hernias and all this sort of thing which

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.050 
hernias and all this sort of thing which
is<00:01:30.090> overworking<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.280> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> come<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.909> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is overworking so I want to come up with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.039 
is overworking so I want to come up with
a<00:01:33.119> term<00:01:34.159> maximum<00:01:35.159> compression<00:01:35.810> which<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
a term maximum compression which is a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.819 
a term maximum compression which is a
useful<00:01:37.950> yet<00:01:38.400> safe<00:01:38.700> level<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> compression<00:01:39.869> for

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
useful yet safe level of compression for

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.300 
useful yet safe level of compression for
being<00:01:41.100> able<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> play<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:43.170> over<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
being able to play all over the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
being able to play all over the
instrument<00:01:44.840> now<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:48.409> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
instrument now the way to do this is to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.940 
instrument now the way to do this is to
become<00:01:50.220> aware<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.060> feeling<00:01:51.720> away<00:01:52.710> from

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
become aware of the feeling away from

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.880 
become aware of the feeling away from
the<00:01:53.070> instrument<00:01:53.280> away<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.909> playing<00:01:54.210> and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the instrument away from playing and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
the instrument away from playing and
start<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.219> recognize<00:01:56.670> okay<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
start and recognize okay there is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200 
start and recognize okay there is
compression<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.619> body<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.310> won't<00:01:59.880> feel

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
compression in my body it won't feel

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.830 
compression in my body it won't feel
like<00:02:00.270> anywhere<00:02:00.960> near<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.979> work<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.840> what

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
like anywhere near as much work as what

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.499 
like anywhere near as much work as what
you<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.259> maybe<00:02:04.799> attempt<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.149> use

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you would maybe attempt to use

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.130 
you would maybe attempt to use
especially<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> upper<00:02:07.890> register<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
especially in the upper register so to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
especially in the upper register so to
start<00:02:10.410> off<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.489> want<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> hiss

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
start off I just want you to do a hiss

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.290 
start off I just want you to do a hiss
okay<00:02:14.340> we're<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> take<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.819> deep<00:02:15.060> breath

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
okay we're going to take a deep breath

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.930 
okay we're going to take a deep breath
and<00:02:15.630> we're<00:02:16.170> gonna<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> hiss<00:02:16.860> support<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and we're gonna do a hiss support the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.230 
and we're gonna do a hiss support the
air<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:19.020> using<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> tongue<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.940> cut

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
air at then using the tongue just cut

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.640 
air at then using the tongue just cut
the<00:02:21.420> flow<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.930> air<00:02:21.959> off<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.560> very

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the flow of the air off so it's very

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.090 
the flow of the air off so it's very
simple<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.520> when<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.850> drop<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> tongue<00:02:30.480> away

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
simple and when you drop the tongue away

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
simple and when you drop the tongue away
the<00:02:32.100> air<00:02:32.250> starts<00:02:32.580> flowing<00:02:32.850> again<00:02:33.209> now<00:02:33.510> be

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the air starts flowing again now be

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.560 
the air starts flowing again now be
careful<00:02:34.020> here<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.770> whole<00:02:35.040> problem<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:36.120> many

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
careful here the whole problem with many

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.360 
careful here the whole problem with many
ideas<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.320> getting<00:02:37.440> compression<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.130> body

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
ideas of getting compression in the body

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.300 
ideas of getting compression in the body
is<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.390> throat<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:40.020> tighten<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.830> we

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
is that the throat can tighten up and we

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.030 
is that the throat can tighten up and we
use<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.760> abdominals<00:02:42.090> way<00:02:42.750> too<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:43.290> okay<00:02:43.980> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
use the abdominals way too much okay so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.020 
use the abdominals way too much okay so
there's<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.489> limit<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.110> keeping<00:02:46.560> this

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
there's a limit so in just keeping this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.190 
there's a limit so in just keeping this
nice<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.090> steady<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.700> want<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:54.900> used

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
nice and steady I want you to get used

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.610 
nice and steady I want you to get used
to<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> feeling<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:58.050> back<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.440> of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
to that feeling of the the back up of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.490 
to that feeling of the the back up of
air<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.250> body<00:02:59.630> okay<00:03:00.630> cuz<00:03:00.989> now<00:03:01.200> we're<00:03:01.410> gonna

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
air in the body okay cuz now we're gonna

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.600 
air in the body okay cuz now we're gonna
get<00:03:01.769> layout<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.950> want<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> use<00:03:08.580> your

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
get layout up and I want you to use your

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.750 
get layout up and I want you to use your
abdominal<00:03:08.910> muscles<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.660> push<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.170> air<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
abdominal muscles and push the air in to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.970 
abdominal muscles and push the air in to
where<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:11.970> tongue<00:03:12.420> meets<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.500> roof<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
where the tongue meets the roof of the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.790 
where the tongue meets the roof of the
mouth<00:03:14.209> okay<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.350> push<00:03:16.769> it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
mouth okay and I want you to push it

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.830 
mouth okay and I want you to push it
quite<00:03:17.220> hard<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.700> make<00:03:17.940> sure<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.390> keep<00:03:18.570> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
quite hard but make sure we keep the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.250 
quite hard but make sure we keep the
throat<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> chest<00:03:19.970> all<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.660> resonant

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
throat and the chest all just resonant

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.460 
throat and the chest all just resonant
okay<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.670> only<00:03:23.940> thing<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:24.269> stopping<00:03:25.079> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
okay the only thing that's stopping the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.550 
okay the only thing that's stopping the
airflow<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.970> flattening<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.630> town<00:03:27.989> so

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
airflow is the flattening of the town so

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.500 
airflow is the flattening of the town so
deep<00:03:28.890> breath<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.310> start<00:03:29.549> off<00:03:29.640> soft<00:03:29.850> get<00:03:30.269> louder

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
deep breath to start off soft get louder

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
deep breath to start off soft get louder
then<00:03:31.230> use<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.620> tongue<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.250> cut<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.640> air<00:03:32.820> off

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
then use the tongue to cut the air off

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.660 
then use the tongue to cut the air off
and<00:03:33.209> push<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.320> air<00:03:34.500> into<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> back<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.549> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
and push the air into the back of the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:45.089 
and push the air into the back of the
tongue

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.970 

okay<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.849> if<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.329> can<00:03:47.510> become<00:03:47.900> familiar<00:03:48.230> with

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
okay so if you can become familiar with

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.330 
okay so if you can become familiar with
that<00:03:49.609> feeling<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.840> go<00:03:51.379> I'm<00:03:51.709> not<00:03:52.099> allowed<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
that feeling and go I'm not allowed to

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.819 
that feeling and go I'm not allowed to
compress<00:03:53.060> any<00:03:53.750> more<00:03:54.469> than<00:03:55.159> that<00:03:56.170> because<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.650> I

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
compress any more than that because if I

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.520 
compress any more than that because if I
was<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.250> push<00:03:58.700> harder<00:03:59.120> there<00:03:59.329> perhaps<00:03:59.959> I'd<00:04:00.319> do

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
was to push harder there perhaps I'd do

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.520 
was to push harder there perhaps I'd do
something<00:04:00.950> quite<00:04:01.609> damaging<00:04:02.170> okay<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.230> try

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
something quite damaging okay so try

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.009 
something quite damaging okay so try
that<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.189> may<00:04:04.459> find<00:04:04.849> a<00:04:05.120> bit<00:04:05.299> of<00:04:05.329> restriction

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
that you may find a bit of restriction

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.080 
that you may find a bit of restriction
in<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.530> throat<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:07.069> want<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.549> make<00:04:07.700> sure<00:04:07.730> that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
in the throat I want to make sure that

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.399 
in the throat I want to make sure that
you<00:04:08.239> keep<00:04:08.739> keep<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.889> all<00:04:10.040> nice<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.310> open<00:04:10.819> and

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
you keep keep it all nice and open and

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.470 
you keep keep it all nice and open and
there<00:04:12.409> is<00:04:12.530> an<00:04:12.709> even<00:04:13.129> balance<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.819> you<00:04:14.420> know

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
there is an even balance of you know

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.940 
there is an even balance of you know
there's<00:04:14.719> tension<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.379> body<00:04:15.560> all

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
there's tension in the body all

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.370 
there's tension in the body all
throughout<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.789> system<00:04:16.970> okay<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.259> an

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
throughout the system okay so it's an

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.890 
throughout the system okay so it's an
interesting<00:04:18.910> concept<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.449> get<00:04:20.630> your<00:04:20.810> head

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
interesting concept to get your head

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.010 
interesting concept to get your head
around<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.440> once<00:04:21.919> you<00:04:22.099> think<00:04:22.370> I'm<00:04:22.550> limited<00:04:23.449> in

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
around but once you think I'm limited in

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.170 
around but once you think I'm limited in
the<00:04:24.919> amount<00:04:25.009> of<00:04:25.250> compression<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.820> can<00:04:26.000> make

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
the amount of compression I can make

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.839 
the amount of compression I can make
just<00:04:26.389> like<00:04:26.570> any<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.840> these<00:04:27.020> guys<00:04:27.490> I'm<00:04:28.490> saying

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
just like any of these guys I'm saying

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.580 
just like any of these guys I'm saying
to<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.030> you've<00:04:29.419> got<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:31.270> compression

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
to you you've got the the compression

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.890 
to you you've got the the compression
capacity<00:04:33.590> in<00:04:33.800> your<00:04:34.310> body<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:35.180> then<00:04:35.389> we<00:04:35.570> need<00:04:35.750> to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
capacity in your body so then we need to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.640 
capacity in your body so then we need to
convert<00:04:36.349> that<00:04:37.030> into<00:04:38.030> sound<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:39.259> we<00:04:39.410> bring

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
convert that into sound so if we bring

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.930 
convert that into sound so if we bring
on<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.949> owl<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:42.080> air<00:04:42.259> vibration

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
on the owl and the the air vibration

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.999 
on the owl and the the air vibration
exercise<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.360> did<00:04:44.599> I<00:04:44.840> want<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.620> keep<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
exercise that we did I want to keep the

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.420 
exercise that we did I want to keep the
air<00:04:46.330> circling<00:04:47.330> between<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.110> lips<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.620> into

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
air circling between the lips and into

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.430 
air circling between the lips and into
the<00:04:49.520> mouthpiece<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.840> last<00:04:51.020> thing<00:04:51.289> that<00:04:51.320> I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
the mouthpiece so the last thing that I

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.029 
the mouthpiece so the last thing that I
want<00:04:51.680> to<00:04:51.770> do<00:04:51.949> is<00:04:52.960> pinch<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.169> lips<00:04:54.349> down<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.860> want

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
want to do is pinch the lips down I want

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.460 
want to do is pinch the lips down I want
the<00:04:55.190> corners<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:56.000> come<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.389> and<00:04:56.599> you<00:04:57.349> may

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
the corners to come in and you may

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.960 
the corners to come in and you may
notice<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.979> arch<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> tongue<00:04:58.729> you've

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
notice the arch of the tongue you've

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.279 
notice the arch of the tongue you've
seen<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.389> shape<00:04:59.630> video<00:05:00.099> so<00:05:01.099> once<00:05:01.490> I've<00:05:01.669> got

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
seen the shape video so once I've got

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.010 
seen the shape video so once I've got
what<00:05:03.289> would<00:05:03.560> be<00:05:03.740> can<00:05:04.070> called<00:05:05.020> maximum

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
what would be can called maximum

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.950 
what would be can called maximum
compression<00:05:06.440> then<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.190> becomes<00:05:07.610> an<00:05:07.940> issue<00:05:08.720> of

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
compression then it becomes an issue of

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.890 
compression then it becomes an issue of
hail<00:05:09.500> air<00:05:09.830> do<00:05:10.130> I<00:05:10.159> want<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.669> play<00:05:10.880> do<00:05:11.539> I<00:05:11.570> want<00:05:11.810> to

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
hail air do I want to play do I want to

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.439 
hail air do I want to play do I want to
play<00:05:11.990> very<00:05:12.380> soft<00:05:12.729> if<00:05:13.729> I<00:05:13.909> take<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.150> full

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
play very soft if I take a full

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.149 
play very soft if I take a full
compression<00:05:14.810> breath<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:18.500> becomes<00:05:18.860> quite

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
compression breath it becomes quite

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.820 
compression breath it becomes quite
difficult<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.820> play<00:05:20.150> soft<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:21.050> if<00:05:21.349> I<00:05:21.470> was<00:05:21.620> to

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
difficult to play soft and if I was to

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.680 
difficult to play soft and if I was to
let<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.370> all<00:05:22.490> go<00:05:22.520> from<00:05:23.449> middle<00:05:23.750> a<00:05:25.539> like<00:05:26.539> the

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
let it all go from middle a like the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.899 
let it all go from middle a like the
note<00:05:26.900> breaks<00:05:27.620> up<00:05:27.860> there's<00:05:28.130> way<00:05:28.490> too<00:05:28.550> much

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
note breaks up there's way too much

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.600 
note breaks up there's way too much
going<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.449> so<00:05:29.780> we<00:05:29.960> will<00:05:30.470> learn<00:05:30.710> over<00:05:30.979> time<00:05:31.310> to

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
going on so we will learn over time to

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.050 
going on so we will learn over time to
regulate<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.270> compression<00:05:33.099> but<00:05:34.099> when<00:05:34.880> we

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
regulate that compression but when we

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.790 
regulate that compression but when we
start<00:05:35.360> going<00:05:35.570> into<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.990> high<00:05:36.169> register

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
start going into the high register

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.430 
start going into the high register
that's<00:05:37.460> when<00:05:37.820> we<00:05:38.090> try<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.930> shoulders

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
that's when we try and the shoulders

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.170 
that's when we try and the shoulders
coming<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:39.949> the<00:05:40.070> neck<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.610> chest<00:05:40.639> and

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
coming in the neck and the chest and

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.570 
coming in the neck and the chest and
everything<00:05:41.389> starts<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.229> tighten<00:05:42.530> up<00:05:42.800> we<00:05:43.340> start

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
everything starts to tighten up we start

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.860 
everything starts to tighten up we start
pushing<00:05:43.940> harder<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:44.300> we<00:05:44.360> start<00:05:44.630> pinching

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
pushing harder and we start pinching

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.370 
pushing harder and we start pinching
harder<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:45.830> all<00:05:46.099> of<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.520> energy<00:05:47.020> gets<00:05:48.020> caught

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
harder so all of the energy gets caught

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.589 
harder so all of the energy gets caught
up<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.800> body<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.340> we<00:05:49.490> choke<00:05:49.820> off<00:05:50.060> which

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
up in the body and we choke off which

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.480 
up in the body and we choke off which
destroys<00:05:51.139> sound<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:51.889> endurance<00:05:52.310> and

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
destroys sound and endurance and

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.790 
destroys sound and endurance and
everything<00:05:52.909> and<00:05:53.120> most<00:05:53.990> importantly<00:05:54.500> stops

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
everything and most importantly stops

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.250 
everything and most importantly stops
the<00:05:54.979> vibration<00:05:55.520> of<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.669> lip<00:05:55.940> so<00:05:56.599> if<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:56.870> can<00:05:57.080> get

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
the vibration of the lip so if I can get

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.510 
the vibration of the lip so if I can get
you<00:05:57.409> to<00:05:57.529> understand

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
you to understand

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.110 
you to understand
maximum<00:05:59.210> compression<00:05:59.630> then<00:06:00.259> don't<00:06:01.120> overdo

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
maximum compression then don't overdo

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.510 
maximum compression then don't overdo
that<00:06:02.300> don't<00:06:02.599> try<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:02.960> go<00:06:03.259> beyond<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:04.460> point

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
that don't try and go beyond that point

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.270 
that don't try and go beyond that point
of<00:06:06.220> maximum<00:06:08.259> you<00:06:09.259> say<00:06:09.440> you<00:06:09.500> can't<00:06:09.860> go<00:06:10.009> beyond

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
of maximum you say you can't go beyond

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.180 
of maximum you say you can't go beyond
maximum<00:06:10.490> but<00:06:11.240> what<00:06:11.389> you<00:06:11.509> can<00:06:11.810> do<00:06:12.050> is<00:06:12.289> tighten

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
maximum but what you can do is tighten

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.480 
maximum but what you can do is tighten
and<00:06:14.349> strain<00:06:15.349> everything<00:06:15.860> but<00:06:16.220> when<00:06:16.340> you're

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
and strain everything but when you're

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.659 
and strain everything but when you're
going<00:06:19.960> you're<00:06:20.960> not<00:06:21.259> so<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.860> want<00:06:22.160> you<00:06:22.220> to<00:06:22.280> become

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
going you're not so I want you to become

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.730 
going you're not so I want you to become
familiar<00:06:23.090> with<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.360> just<00:06:23.930> be<00:06:24.050> cool

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
familiar with that just be cool

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.890 
familiar with that just be cool
Ellen<00:06:25.580> bouzouki<00:06:26.030> there's<00:06:26.210> a<00:06:26.270> great<00:06:26.479> video<00:06:26.690> of

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
Ellen bouzouki there's a great video of

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.370 
Ellen bouzouki there's a great video of
him<00:06:27.139> and<00:06:27.259> he<00:06:27.319> talks<00:06:27.530> about<00:06:27.650> a<00:06:27.830> circle

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
him and he talks about a circle

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.520 
him and he talks about a circle
relaxation<00:06:30.380> here<00:06:31.300> relaxation<00:06:32.530> everything's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
relaxation here relaxation everything's

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.820 
relaxation here relaxation everything's
cool<00:06:33.830> there<00:06:34.039> the<00:06:34.190> abdominals<00:06:34.699> are<00:06:34.849> supporting

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
cool there the abdominals are supporting

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.339 
cool there the abdominals are supporting
the<00:06:36.830> compression<00:06:37.509> the<00:06:38.509> airs<00:06:38.720> gonna<00:06:38.870> come<00:06:39.199> out

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
the compression the airs gonna come out

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.010 
the compression the airs gonna come out
freely<00:06:39.770> between<00:06:39.919> the<00:06:40.250> lips<00:06:40.659> so<00:06:41.659> we<00:06:41.780> want<00:06:41.960> to

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
freely between the lips so we want to

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.059 
freely between the lips so we want to
keep<00:06:42.169> cool<00:06:42.440> here

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:07:07.420 

okay<00:06:46.069> let's<00:06:46.280> convert<00:06:46.610> that<00:06:46.759> into<00:06:47.000> sand

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.950 

okay<00:07:08.430> so<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:08.850> was<00:07:08.970> slipping<00:07:09.390> around<00:07:09.720> a<00:07:09.840> little

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
okay so it was slipping around a little

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.610 
okay so it was slipping around a little
bit<00:07:10.200> but<00:07:10.440> you<00:07:10.590> can<00:07:10.620> hear<00:07:11.310> in<00:07:11.430> that<00:07:11.870> that<00:07:12.870> I'm

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
bit but you can hear in that that I'm

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.570 
bit but you can hear in that that I'm
not<00:07:13.820> pinching<00:07:14.820> down<00:07:15.500> to<00:07:16.500> keep<00:07:16.740> volume<00:07:17.160> up<00:07:17.340> you

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
not pinching down to keep volume up you

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.630 
not pinching down to keep volume up you
need<00:07:18.450> the<00:07:18.690> maximum<00:07:19.110> compression<00:07:19.590> but<00:07:20.280> because

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
need the maximum compression but because

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.810 
need the maximum compression but because
this<00:07:20.820> is<00:07:20.970> all<00:07:21.120> staying<00:07:21.480> relaxed<00:07:22.320> he<00:07:23.220> is<00:07:23.370> coming

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
this is all staying relaxed he is coming

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:37.720 
this is all staying relaxed he is coming
through<00:07:24.180> those<00:07:24.870> are<00:07:25.110> upper<00:07:25.350> harmonics<00:07:26.010> peak
