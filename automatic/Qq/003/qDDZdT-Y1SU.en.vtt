mushroom<00:04:15.420> takes<00:04:15.810> sugars<00:04:16.229> from<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> grass<00:04:16.769> so

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
mushroom takes sugars from the grass so

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.140 
mushroom takes sugars from the grass so
that<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.669> grow<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:19.470> because<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.400> you

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
that it can grow and because of that you

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.010 
that it can grow and because of that you
can<00:04:21.299> often<00:04:21.450> see<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:23.070> ring<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.550> Lux<00:04:23.880> grass<00:04:24.270> from

sort<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> mushrooms<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.730> could<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:38.970> around<00:04:39.210> in

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
because of the Rings it just makes them

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.100 
because of the Rings it just makes them
much<00:04:43.800> more<00:04:43.830> visible<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.940> think<00:04:45.540> all<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
much more visible I think all the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.720 
much more visible I think all the
mushrooms<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.620> we<00:04:46.740> do<00:04:46.890> collect<00:04:47.280> some

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
mushrooms that we do collect some

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.700 
mushrooms that we do collect some
George's<00:04:48.120> mushrooms<00:04:48.540> seem<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.020> promote<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
George's mushrooms seem to promote the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.160 
George's mushrooms seem to promote the
grass<00:04:49.980> more<00:04:50.520> than<00:04:50.880> any<00:04:51.000> others<00:04:51.360> there<00:04:52.020> are<00:04:52.140> a

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
grass more than any others there are a

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.840 
grass more than any others there are a
couple<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.650> other<00:04:52.770> grassland<00:04:53.370> mushrooms<00:04:53.730> that

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
couple of other grassland mushrooms that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.370 
couple of other grassland mushrooms that
will<00:04:53.970> do<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> same<00:04:59.390> but<00:05:00.390> what<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.230> just

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
will do the same but what it is is just

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.170 
will do the same but what it is is just
the<00:05:01.530> mushroom<00:05:01.830> underground<00:05:02.280> helping<00:05:02.850> feed

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
the mushroom underground helping feed

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.080 
the mushroom underground helping feed
the<00:05:03.210> grass<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:04.500> if<00:05:04.890> we<00:05:05.100> come<00:05:05.310> round<00:05:05.520> having<00:05:05.910> a

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
the grass so if we come round having a

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.520 
the grass so if we come round having a
look<00:05:06.210> around<00:05:06.390> this<00:05:06.780> ring<00:05:07.020> we<00:05:07.170> picked<00:05:07.410> a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
look around this ring we picked a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.760 
look around this ring we picked a
mushroom<00:05:07.950> there<00:05:12.020> we're<00:05:13.020> gonna<00:05:13.200> leave<00:05:13.410> those

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
mushroom there we're gonna leave those

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.130 
mushroom there we're gonna leave those
maybe<00:05:14.370> take<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.820> biggest<00:05:15.030> one<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:18.660> mushrooms

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
maybe take the biggest one the mushrooms

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.130 
maybe take the biggest one the mushrooms
they're<00:05:20.060> moving<00:05:21.060> around<00:05:21.180> here<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.840> little<00:05:22.170> baby

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
they're moving around here a little baby

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.220 
they're moving around here a little baby
and<00:05:25.140> more<00:05:25.830> here<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:26.700> by<00:05:27.360> following<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:28.020> ring

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
and more here so by following the ring

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.080 
and more here so by following the ring
round<00:05:28.530> if<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.250> can<00:05:29.580> see<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:31.040> you'll<00:05:32.040> find<00:05:32.370> all

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
round if you can see it you'll find all

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.120 
round if you can see it you'll find all
the<00:05:33.660> mushrooms<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:34.290> this<00:05:34.560> underground

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
the mushrooms that this underground

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.550 
the mushrooms that this underground
organism<00:05:35.910> isn't<00:05:36.150> producing<00:05:36.690> don't<00:05:37.170> pick<00:05:37.410> them

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
organism isn't producing don't pick them

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.530 
organism isn't producing don't pick them
all<00:05:37.740> we<00:05:38.280> want<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.550> mushroom<00:05:38.850> to<00:05:39.090> procreate

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
all we want this mushroom to procreate

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.840 
all we want this mushroom to procreate
we<00:05:39.870> want<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.230> spread<00:05:40.470> its<00:05:40.680> seed<00:05:40.950> and<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.730> can

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
we want it to spread its seed and it can

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.700 
we want it to spread its seed and it can
only<00:05:41.940> do<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.450> if<00:05:42.600> we<00:05:42.750> leave<00:05:42.900> mushrooms<00:05:43.470> there

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
only do that if we leave mushrooms there

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.770 
only do that if we leave mushrooms there
to<00:05:46.490> school<00:05:47.490> institute<00:05:47.910> says<00:05:48.180> never<00:05:48.450> take<00:05:48.630> more

to school institute says never take more

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.810 
to school institute says never take more
than<00:05:48.870> one<00:05:49.050> point<00:05:49.260> seven<00:05:49.680> kilos<00:05:49.950> of<00:05:50.640> any

than one point seven kilos of any

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.660 
than one point seven kilos of any
mushroom<00:05:51.330> from<00:05:51.630> anywhere<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.950> that's<00:05:53.040> purely

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
mushroom from anywhere and that's purely

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.880 
mushroom from anywhere and that's purely
so<00:05:54.390> that<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.630> mushroom<00:05:55.020> can<00:05:55.260> procreate

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
so that the mushroom can procreate

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.530 
so that the mushroom can procreate
because<00:05:56.520> all<00:05:56.640> we're<00:05:56.790> seeing<00:05:56.940> here<00:05:57.210> all<00:05:57.390> this

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
because all we're seeing here all this

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.690 
because all we're seeing here all this
is<00:05:57.750> is<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.260> fruiting<00:05:58.770> body<00:05:59.040> of<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.220> mushroom

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
is is the fruiting body of the mushroom

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.750 
is is the fruiting body of the mushroom
kind<00:05:59.910> of<00:05:59.970> like<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.120> sample<00:06:04.070> which<00:06:05.070> is<00:06:05.100> enhanced

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
kind of like a sample which is enhanced

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.370 
kind of like a sample which is enhanced
when<00:06:05.880> you<00:06:05.970> dry<00:06:06.210> it<00:06:06.270> if<00:06:06.540> you<00:06:06.660> want<00:06:06.810> it<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.080> dry<00:06:07.320> it

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
when you dry it if you want it to dry it

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.590 
when you dry it if you want it to dry it
then<00:06:07.680> you<00:06:07.800> would<00:06:07.920> slice<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.550> and<00:06:08.940> air<00:06:09.240> dry<00:06:09.540> it

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
then you would slice it and air dry it

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.260 
then you would slice it and air dry it
just<00:06:09.900> beside<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.230> fan<00:06:10.530> or<00:06:10.770> on<00:06:10.890> a<00:06:10.920> windowsill<00:06:11.850> on

a breezy day and they dry fairly quickly

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.970 
a breezy day and they dry fairly quickly
and<00:06:15.270> you<00:06:15.450> can<00:06:15.480> store<00:06:15.900> them<00:06:16.140> for<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.500> very<00:06:16.800> very
