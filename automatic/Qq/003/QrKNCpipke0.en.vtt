00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.660
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.120
 base for a Christmas candle for it 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.770
 we are going to need a poliespÃ¡n ball 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.980
 that as you can see there are different 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.100
 sizes of the colors a candle 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.690
 elongated and pins the first thing that 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.980
 let's do is cut the base of the 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.980
 ball to keep 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.280
 once we have cut it we are going to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.960
 mark on the other side the diameter of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.550
 candle to know what we have to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.370
 cut to make the hole where then 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.620
 we will fit the candle 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.039
 when we have marked it we begin to 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.039
 empty 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.400
 the depth of the cut we make 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 will depend a bit on the type of candle that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.750
 we have chosen but enough 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.750
 so that the candle then stays 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.390
 more or less you have to stay like this 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.670
 when you have the hole already done 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.320
 checked that the candle goes in well 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.080
 and it holds up we can start 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520
 cut the fabrics we choose the fabrics of 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.870
 the colors that we like but 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.250
 you have to choose different colors 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.260
 because then we are going to do rows 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 then once we have chosen the 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.970
 fabrics we started to cut squares of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.280
 10 for 10 in case you want 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.380
 do the small base instead of 10 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.800
 it could have to be 7 x 7 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.800
 centimeters 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.220
 when we have already cut the squares 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.730
 1 to 1 we will go doing the following 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.000
 we bend in half 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.680
 we mark well and then we attract each 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 one of the corners towards the center 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.600
 this will have to be done with all 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.850
 square we have reserved one of the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.710
 squares to line the hole where 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.710
 It was where the candle will go 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 we put it in the center we put the candle 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.800
 and we hold the edges with pins 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.379
 when we already have the center we will begin 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.530
 to decorate the candle for it, let's go 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.900
 taking the triangles and we will go 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.150
 placing in a row holding them with 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.810
 pins that we will put in each of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.810
 the extremes 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.099
 so one after the other 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.630
 when we have finished with the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.490
 first row we will take triangles of 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.490
 other colors and we will put them below 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.630
 following the same process 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.480
 this is the final result as you see 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.460
 you can make different combinations and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.110
 different sizes and next to their can 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.540
 to be a Christmas centerpiece very 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.980
