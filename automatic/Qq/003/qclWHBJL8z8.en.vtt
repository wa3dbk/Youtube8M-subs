the Constitutional Convention precisely

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390 
the Constitutional Convention precisely
in<00:02:33.570> case<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.020> president<00:02:34.650> ever<00:02:34.860> pardoned

in case a president ever pardoned

someone<00:02:35.820> from<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.450> crime<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.810> he<00:02:37.200> himself<00:02:37.350> was

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
someone from a crime that he himself was

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.910 
someone from a crime that he himself was
in<00:02:37.950> any<00:02:38.220> way<00:02:38.310> involved<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:39.000> much<00:02:39.870> less<00:02:40.230> part

of the crime of obstruction of justice

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.230 
of the crime of obstruction of justice
for<00:02:43.050> obstructing<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> investigation<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.820> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
crime that the President himself

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.890 
crime that the President himself
committed<00:02:46.890> much<00:02:47.580> less<00:02:47.940> pardoning<00:02:48.870> crimes

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
committed much less pardoning crimes

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260 
committed much less pardoning crimes
that<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> president<00:02:50.100> authorized<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that the president authorized the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.240 
that the president authorized the
commission<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> much<00:02:52.470> less<00:02:52.709> actually

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
commission of much less actually

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
commission of much less actually
pardoning<00:02:53.700> himself<00:02:54.240> which<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> possibility

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
pardoning himself which is a possibility

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.820 
pardoning himself which is a possibility
here<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.390> argue<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> pardon<00:02:58.590> power

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
here so to argue that the pardon power

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.430 
here so to argue that the pardon power
covers<00:02:59.520> the<00:03:00.000> very<00:03:00.330> same<00:03:00.630> offense<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.380> which

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
covers the very same offense for which

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.560 
covers the very same offense for which
the<00:03:01.860> impeachment<00:03:02.160> power<00:03:02.580> was<00:03:02.850> created<00:03:03.330> is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the impeachment power was created is

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.570 
the impeachment power was created is
absolutely<00:03:04.500> absurd<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.890> don't<00:03:05.160> care<00:03:05.280> how<00:03:05.430> many

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
absolutely absurd I don't care how many

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.940 
absolutely absurd I don't care how many
law<00:03:05.820> degrees<00:03:06.150> you've<00:03:06.330> got<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.560> don't<00:03:07.770> care

if you worked in Nixon's White House

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.320 
if you worked in Nixon's White House
it's<00:03:09.630> absolutely<00:03:10.380> absurd<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.970> what<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.120> going

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
it's absolutely absurd and what is going

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's absolutely absurd and what is going
to<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.510> pardoned<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.670> what<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.150> going<00:03:15.330> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
to be pardoned this is what is going to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.120 
to be pardoned this is what is going to

be pardoned if anything and this is what
