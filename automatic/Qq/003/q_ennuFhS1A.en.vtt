graduated first in his physics class at
Harvard<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.790> mean<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.090> more<00:00:33.239> could<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.600> ask

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
Harvard I mean what more could you ask

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.160 
Harvard I mean what more could you ask
for

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

alright<00:00:34.440> Michiyo<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> into

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
alright Michiyo this I'm not that into

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.270 
alright Michiyo this I'm not that into
science<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> mean<00:00:37.559> honestly<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> got<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
science I mean honestly I got to be

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
science I mean honestly I got to be
honest<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.059> knocked<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.570> earth

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
honest with you but it knocked the earth

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.860 
honest with you but it knocked the earth
off<00:00:40.079> its<00:00:40.379> axis<00:00:40.590> even<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:41.730> attention

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
off its axis even that got my attention

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.180 
off its axis even that got my attention
well<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:43.649> one's<00:00:43.800> gonna<00:00:43.950> fall

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
well first of all no one's gonna fall

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
well first of all no one's gonna fall
off<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> earth<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
off the earth you're not gonna get a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
off the earth you're not gonna get a
shorter<00:00:46.140> work<00:00:46.320> week<00:00:46.590> however<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.640> earth<00:00:47.789> did

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
shorter work week however the earth did

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.380 
shorter work week however the earth did
shift<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.960> inches<00:00:49.530> off<00:00:49.829> its<00:00:50.190> axis<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
shift three inches off its axis and the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049 
shift three inches off its axis and the
day<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:52.020> actually<00:00:52.230> shortened<00:00:52.980> by<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.850> point

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
day was actually shortened by one point

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
day was actually shortened by one point
two<00:00:54.329> six<00:00:54.570> microseconds<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
two six microseconds how this was a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
two six microseconds how this was a
colossal<00:00:56.969> earthquake<00:00:57.539> remember<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
colossal earthquake remember that the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
colossal earthquake remember that the
earth<00:00:58.620> shifted<00:00:59.129> six<00:00:59.399> feet<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.090> resistance<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
earth shifted six feet or resistance of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
earth shifted six feet or resistance of
several<00:01:01.410> hundred<00:01:01.949> miles<00:01:02.270> 20<00:01:03.270> miles

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
several hundred miles 20 miles

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
several hundred miles 20 miles
underneath<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.409> ground<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> skater

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
underneath the ground it's like a skater

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
underneath the ground it's like a skater
bringing<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.689> her<00:01:06.869> arms<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> Olympics<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
bringing in her arms at the Olympics you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
bringing in her arms at the Olympics you
spend<00:01:08.340> faster<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.909> faster<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.720> earth

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
spend faster and faster the earth

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
spend faster and faster the earth
actually<00:01:10.200> contracted<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.640> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
actually contracted look what we have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
actually contracted look what we have
ready<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.780> talk<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> us<00:01:13.229> about

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
ready to go as you talk to us about

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.149 
ready to go as you talk to us about
skaters<00:01:14.960> right<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> Carrigan<00:01:16.890> she's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
skaters right so you Carrigan she's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.289 
skaters right so you Carrigan she's
doing<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> earthquake<00:01:18.420> did

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
doing the same thing the earthquake did

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
doing the same thing the earthquake did
that's<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.509> okay<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.470> explain<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> me<00:01:23.130> how

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that's out okay how explain to me how

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
that's out okay how explain to me how
that<00:01:23.280> move<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:25.049> she<00:01:25.259> brings

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that move right there is as she brings

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
that move right there is as she brings
in<00:01:25.830> her<00:01:25.979> arms<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> crust<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in her arms it's like the crust of the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
in her arms it's like the crust of the
earth<00:01:27.740> contracting<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.430> plate<00:01:29.729> went

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
earth contracting as one plate went

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.569 
earth contracting as one plate went
under<00:01:30.270> another<00:01:30.540> plate<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.530> several<00:01:32.189> hundred

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
under another plate so several hundred

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.080 
under another plate so several hundred
miles<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.119> plate<00:01:33.390> six<00:01:34.259> shifted<00:01:35.100> six<00:01:35.430> feet<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
miles of plate six shifted six feet in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
miles of plate six shifted six feet in
the<00:01:36.299> earth<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.439> increased<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the earth and that increased the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.740 
the earth and that increased the
rotational<00:01:38.909> speed<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> earth

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
rotational speed because the earth

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
rotational speed because the earth
contracted<00:01:40.590> slightly<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.310> does<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> mean

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
contracted slightly so what does it mean

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.889 
contracted slightly so what does it mean
for<00:01:41.880> us<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.119> mean<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.390> gonna<00:01:42.509> start<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
for us I mean are we gonna start to be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.770 
for us I mean are we gonna start to be
walking<00:01:43.110> around<00:01:43.259> tilted<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> left<00:01:43.920> now

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
walking around tilted to the left now

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
walking around tilted to the left now
it's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.049> tiny<00:01:46.350> effect<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.040> however<00:01:47.850> GPS

does it shorten the day by a couple of
seconds<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:58.170> instead<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.590> 24<00:01:59.520> plus<00:01:59.820> or
