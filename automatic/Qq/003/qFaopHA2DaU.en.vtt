00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
on your tops you want to make sure that

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.030 
on your tops you want to make sure that
when<00:06:54.550> you<00:06:54.640> cut<00:06:54.850> these<00:06:55.000> lateral<00:06:55.930> branches<00:06:56.410> they

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
when you cut these lateral branches they

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.590 
when you cut these lateral branches they
at<00:06:57.250> least<00:06:57.370> see<00:06:57.580> where<00:06:57.730> one<00:06:57.910> or<00:06:57.940> two<00:06:58.180> buds<00:06:58.450> are

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
at least see where one or two buds are

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.660 
at least see where one or two buds are
gone<00:06:58.810> we<00:06:59.470> make<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.800> cut<00:07:00.010> I'll<00:07:00.130> probably<00:07:00.370> go<00:07:00.610> to

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
gone we make the cut I'll probably go to

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.270 
gone we make the cut I'll probably go to
for<00:07:00.910> more<00:07:01.060> fuzz<00:07:01.330> but<00:07:01.630> just<00:07:01.780> to<00:07:01.870> be<00:07:01.960> sure

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
for more fuzz but just to be sure

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.010 
for more fuzz but just to be sure
just<00:07:03.280> look<00:07:03.430> for<00:07:03.460> a<00:07:03.610> little<00:07:03.850> round<00:07:04.450> spot<00:07:04.870> in

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
just look for a little round spot in

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.760 
just look for a little round spot in
there<00:07:05.200> that<00:07:05.350> can<00:07:05.500> super<00:07:05.830> fuzzy<00:07:06.780> and<00:07:07.780> cut<00:07:08.620> that

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
there that can super fuzzy and cut that

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.020 
there that can super fuzzy and cut that
back<00:07:08.980> here<00:07:09.310> we're<00:07:09.400> going<00:07:09.490> to<00:07:09.580> take<00:07:09.700> off<00:07:09.880> about

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
back here we're going to take off about

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.970 
back here we're going to take off about
half<00:07:10.450> otherwise<00:07:11.380> we're<00:07:11.620> going<00:07:11.710> to<00:07:11.770> end<00:07:11.830> up

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
half otherwise we're going to end up

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.770 
half otherwise we're going to end up
with<00:07:12.160> too<00:07:12.310> much<00:07:12.460> space<00:07:12.760> between<00:07:12.820> our<00:07:13.330> branches

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
with too much space between our branches

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.720 
with too much space between our branches
and<00:07:14.350> the<00:07:14.830> same<00:07:14.980> thing<00:07:15.160> in<00:07:15.250> the<00:07:15.310> pine<00:07:15.520> teas

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
we're going a lot more bud formation on

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.170 
we're going a lot more bud formation on
the<00:07:17.260> top<00:07:17.560> and<00:07:17.980> these<00:07:18.310> buds<00:07:18.640> here<00:07:18.880> when<00:07:19.090> it

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
the top and these buds here when it

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.090 
the top and these buds here when it
develops<00:07:19.570> more<00:07:19.780> fully<00:07:20.080> and<00:07:20.740> we're<00:07:20.920> going<00:07:21.040> to
