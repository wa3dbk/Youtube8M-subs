00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 youtube hall and welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.569
 ninth country video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.649
 we start with the Czech 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.480
 Energydrinks the beginning of course makes 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.540
 one of the series bright 20 more 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.100
 Caffeine also fits very well 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.199
 I'm watching the constantin us series 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.949
 and he plays well one right 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.650
 good role 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 What irritates me a bit is up here 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.270
 the little hint you have to look for 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.440
 redgrave so red grape and oh yes 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.329
 Here we see now twice as 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 as a small logo on it from the design 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 he is already different 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.809
 some of the light drinks we have here 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.719
 so know and then of course 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.730
 now expects 20 percent more caffeine 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.550
 he expects me somehow, too 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 believe 32 milligrams of caffeine on 100 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.020
 milliliters 20 more, so we become 236 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.059
 somewhere probably at 7 in total 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.350
 then if I'm not right now 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 expected pi times thumb 39 kilos 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 caffeine grams kilo milligrams of caffeine 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.360
 to 100 milliliters and we come exactly 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.220
 at 38 4 so probably as well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 me as it should be so we 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 have really raised this one here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 caffeine content then I really have to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.020
 I thought this energy 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 Drinks are now 32 in Europe 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 milligrams sealed but apparently 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 apparently not here 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.299
 exceptions then caffeine content demba ba 46 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.790
 kilocalories to 100 milliliters 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.180
 normal and the 250 milliliters 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.670
 can of course from czech and without 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 Pfandsiegel should lay now was once going on 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 so great test yes smells like energy drink 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 but there is still something there 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.700
 another energy drink plus something yes 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.360
 ok to look forward to the color if we 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.370
 this one already 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 call red grape if there is nothing now 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.190
 red comes out okay let you 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.040
 consistently fit so far holds 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.550
 transparent minimal blistering 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.650
 Okay, so is my mine too 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.950
 my color requirements were sufficient 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:30.120
 done now but the taste test 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:39.220
 cheers she is so sweet so sweet but tasty 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:40.989
 first impression sweet but delicious yes me 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.290
 Say a reason gummi bear juice 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 for the energy drink is there but 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 I really do not know about that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.680
 whether I would call the red grape or 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.880
 whether it is even remotely 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.890
 but grape juice reminds any 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.280
 artificial fruit aroma is still there with 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.980
 in it 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 In any case, but I would not 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.190
 as a combination of grape juice and 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.190
 Energy drinks do not see this 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.130
 overall taste you go but 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 absolutely okay a little bit sweet on 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.080
 In the beginning you have to get used to it 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.390
 then it does not burn a lot tingles 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.390
 not much is pleasant to drink 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.250
 yes, if you change your mind too much 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.380
 his normal average 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.570
 having energy drink gummy bears juices 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.420
 Definitely worth a recommendation 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.580
 is very gentle in the taste of what 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.140
 other should that it should have been 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.880
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.880
 and bye video bye
