00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.200
 well we are going to present now how 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:13.080
 residence policy is based on the post 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.750
 of the blog I also point well I think it has a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 of the great moments of the life of the moment 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 is the first choice of your residence 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.970
 nor what will always work to do 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 medical residency 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 and the second is because it is a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 work after training 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.599
 are two essential moments that will 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 direct the here in the professional 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 so this video was highlight at the moment 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 the choice of medical residency is 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980
 neurosurgery which is a bit of my 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 experience 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.710
 the first thing you do not have to know 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 that the residence will be your main 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.850
 letter of introduction if when people 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 form a place that formed with the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 university with college is the thing 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 more asked a second moment will 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 be very much you have resided 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 so that's why it's very important, I'm going 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 highlight 5 points for choosing your 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 residence 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.260
 is first in specialty school 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.240
 then choose dom to domicile 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 when you study for 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.170
 evidence of residency in surgery and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.170
 strategies for proof of residence 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 first moment by choosing your 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.299
 specialty 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.659
 we know that medicine or the field 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.610
 very wide of activity from the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.060
 generalist in which an option to the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.369
 specialties and a general in college 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 It's a moment that we have in the first 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.090
 contact is with the daily lives of these 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 specialties 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.900
 So I do not think it's ideal that people try 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 good hair always living 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 early specialization that previously 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 specializes has to be good money 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 and an option also to be 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 general is increasingly growing 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.780
 a good option 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 I am the general practitioner the doctor of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.689
 family 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.549
 so the first thing that has to be 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.159
 a lot of bread 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.140
 there you have the opportunity to have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.630
 access to various sectors chosen in the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.520
 what will be your specialty and in the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 the last two years in hospital is also 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.780
 very essential for this that you have a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.720
 contact with the day to day 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.540
 of each specialty else is 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.370
 essential is obviously talking goes 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.750
 talk to people talk to 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 specialists 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.480
 so I saw his experiment a little 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 how was your choice 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.050
 second, then choose which 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.989
 area that you can get your 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.810
 and if it is necessary not to do 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.850
 residence is and where you will make your 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 resistance then as I told where 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.520
 you get to your residence area 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.840
 performance 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.230
 so you have to worry more 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.010
 Where are you going to do that? Where will you go? 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.420
 pass 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.480
 there is a big difference is that it has to 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.680
 choose the location and try to focus on it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.140
 neurosurgery 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.269
 we have the society can understand 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.340
 surgery with your site has the services 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.350
 registered with him and also has services 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.700
 registered by the mec in the services option 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.610
 of residence 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.230
 so a good strategy that I always 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.600
 in the same surgery called society 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.370
 is also to try to achieve these two 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.330
 things is to see so many people get enough 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.280
 by mec account of fpm and also chat 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.549
 with specialists in general species 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.570
 such a good concept of 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.720
 reference 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.160
 I think you should focus there because the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.630
 The bus is said to make your 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.850
 evidence if fundamental in your career 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.450
 in the third, the very frequent doubt is 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.079
 when they make their residence nor is each 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.060
 Again, the faculties are often 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.040
 You just have to pay for college or else 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.440
 during college to strive to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.630
 holding the west of college was 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.850
 very much mind six years 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.549
 I see that I like to see if the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.680
 strategy is my case I graduated and there is already 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.260
 people in the residence but the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.440
 be considered to hold proof of 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.220
 residence in the case being approved and 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 the army guarding the money or 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.739
 then enter the residence directly 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.320
 another option also wait a little and 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.570
 to work a little 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.859
 a little money and then went to 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.539
 residence must remember that the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.450
 mainly neutral residence 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.610
 of insistence the resident girl knows 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.750
 which is very low then it is the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.210
 time 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.010
 it's really difficult was to view 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.300
 financial is not good I should 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.700
 mainly hardly gives 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.510
 work outside of 14 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.770
 then a thing to be weighed too 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:43.760
 obviously we see a reality is 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:46.640
 possible not the fourth moment the highlight 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.920
 is a student of residence in surgery 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.840
 then study for the test more than 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.170
 It seems a simple thing people know that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.460
 each place has specificity 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.960
 neurosurgery is a specialty that 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.390
 there are very few places for mac comes a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.610
 The third vargas by society is also 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.040
 much happier has few 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.680
 specialties they despite being almost 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.340
 the majority concentrated in some states 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.480
 as the river sao paulo River and Great Southern 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.700
 minas gerais 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.150
 we travel a lot and making proof is 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.860
 important to understand the specialty of 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.800
 proof of the place the times in general 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.220
 They are national, we do not know, and systems 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.350
 huh 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.240
 but he has to understand that each location 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.919
 has its specificity so it's worth it 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.770
 Do you have any idea what your dust will be? 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.630
 to have you do a specific study 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.400
 I particularly like 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.740
 studying questions and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.360
 strategy or is it just right 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.970
 giving continuity to a little of how 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.650
 studying is you trying to focus on the most 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.229
 You can do all the tests the tests 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.900
 known and very often failed 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.120
 more with our own damaged 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.740
 so you'll try and we do not have 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.740
 money in general for travel 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.510
 for all the necessary tests 30 and 80 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.640
 I think the good strategy to try 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.530
 focus on your places do you think 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.050
 interesting to do does a study 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.450
 specific paper proof and assemble a 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.790
 calendar based on that location 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.700
 and from there you will do 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.919
 results were good depending on the 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.979
 fit did not have a point more 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.770
 easy to organize your own 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.479
 calendar is sure to be good 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.770
 tight to do the proof of 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.270
 residence 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.270
 Thank you so much, I hope it has been
