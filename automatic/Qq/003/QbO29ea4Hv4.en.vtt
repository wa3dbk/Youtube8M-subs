 the teenager 's brother 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 Hi everyone , today's video is the video of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.750
 Tips on How to Make Your Enamel Last 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.230
 But I stopped for the tips here for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.230
 you 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.020
 so let's see all these good tips 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.020
 with me 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.160
 good first of all let the nails 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.780
 It is very important that you leave the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.470
 nail surface 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 she looks lighter and stronger 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.199
 also because he knows those dots that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 place where you are weakest and the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.510
 People do not have it so it makes it good to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.510
 always make her beautiful and healthy 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 Now it's very important that you do this. 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.590
 clean any remaining residue 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.650
 the waste left by the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.380
 sandpaper how much moisturizers or something 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.930
 What have you gone before so do not let 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.010
 nothing and do not change anything to increase 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.010
 adherence of bags 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.960
 now it's base time many people 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.200
 skip this step because you do not find 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 important but do not do this from 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.580
 of the base is very important result 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.710
 because it will protect that nail and 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.360
 many bases still have some benefits 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.750
 specifics such as strengthen and tamina cet 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.750
 and to have 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.719
 Oh, and do not forget to wait for the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.000
 nails and karen is that really every 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.670
 trap that you spend is very 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.649
 cool if you let her dry for you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.429
 apply the next because besides 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:11.269
 facilitating the enamelling time is also 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.269
 better in the final drying because it will stay 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.510
 The faster you 'll be able to make your 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.489
 Things faster for choice 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.590
 good quality enamel 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.049
 the glazes of brands that you are already 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.660
 accustomed to wearing that likes each one has 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.830
 your preference but watch out for the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.500
 smell and also the texture because it does not 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.610
 Nothing advances all the tips if at the end 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.230
 Enamel is bad or bad and then 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.230
 it will not last even 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.019
 application time 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.720
 after thin layers and to facilitate the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.349
 drying process is much better you 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.590
 apply three thin layers than two 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:05.019
 very thick layers because it facilitates 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.019
 drying and also the adhesion of enamel 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.860
 and after each layer expect to dry it is 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 super fast since the layer will be well 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.930
 also apply on each layer 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.100
 very soon that the enamel is 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.100
 better more beautiful 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 sometimes the second layer is clear 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.680
 expect to dry 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.870
 Now I'm finishing the process. 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.950
 passed the little pin placing the drawing 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.300
 on the nail and cleaning the nooks 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.980
 usually ending as 20 always 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.590
 does and finally the one from here but will have the last 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.900
 tip that I think is cooler also wants 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.970
 clean the tip of the nail you get one 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.730
 cotton bud dives into your 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.020
 enamel remover and passes on tip 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.860
 of the nail 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.910
 this will avoid direct contact with 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.300
 Enamel and will remember a little bit 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.560
 that when it begins to peel syndic 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.230
 ugly, right? 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 but it's not kind of take too long to stay 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.250
 visible is only to get underneath so you know 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.600
 But then it's personal, these were the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.050
 home hope you enjoyed
