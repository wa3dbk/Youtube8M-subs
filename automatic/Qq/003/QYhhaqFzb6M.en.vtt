00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
know they were noiseless you got some

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.170 
know they were noiseless you got some
extra<00:02:30.629> output<00:02:31.080> some<00:02:31.319> extra<00:02:31.590> boost<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.190> now

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
extra output some extra boost so now

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.699 
extra output some extra boost so now
we're<00:02:33.629> making<00:02:33.720> our<00:02:33.900> passive<00:02:34.290> pickups<00:02:34.410> an

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
we're making our passive pickups an

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.830 
we're making our passive pickups an
active<00:02:35.069> housing<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.450> don't<00:02:36.599> have<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
active housing so you don't have to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720 
active housing so you don't have to
sacrifice<00:02:37.050> kind<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.250> organic

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
sacrifice kind of the the organic

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.270 
sacrifice kind of the the organic
presence<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.450> an<00:02:39.959> attack<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.860> tone<00:02:41.069> of
