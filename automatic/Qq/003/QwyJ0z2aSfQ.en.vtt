00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.680
 a greeting all and well found in the 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.590
 our kitchen 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.369
 today the time of a dessert we cook and the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.230
 kamut pancakes and the ingredients for 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.240
 our kamut pancakes and I 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 they are the ones you see 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.769
 let's start with 300 g of kamut flour 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 white 150 g of rice malt 60 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.920
 milliliters of corn oil 50 g of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.460
 raisins washed and drained 150 grams of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 golden apples already peeled and cut 100 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 milliliters of soy milk a sachet 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.150
 of baking powder a pinch of salt 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 a pinch of cinnamon and the peel 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.740
 grated half line 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.330
 the first thing to pass the apples through 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.670
 in the mixer to obtain a compound 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.830
 homogeneous 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:09.630
 so I put there apple wedges in the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.960
 mixer together with the salt outlet and the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960
 cinnamon 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:25.100
 finally I add the zest of the lime that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:29.899
 I grated and turned the motor 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.899
 thus obtaining my compound 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 this is the result we get 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.630
 then an apple puree with zest of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.960
 lime and cinnamon and I'm going to combine it with others 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:52.759
 two ingredients incorporating the malt of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.759
 rice and corn oil 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.399
 this is the result I get now 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.810
 I put these aside for a moment 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:14.959
 I prepare ingredients in a container 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.959
 the largest kamut flour 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:30.739

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.739

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:44.070

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:54.830

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:54.830
 apple mixture and soy milk 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.900
 I'm going to knead it all up to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.310
 get a soft mixture that I can 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.840
 pick up work with a spoon 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.730
 a little and let it rest at a temperature 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.709
 environment for at least half an hour I put of 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.659

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.720
