with the parsley leaves but they just

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.000 
with the parsley leaves but they just

didn't have any now the important part

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.240 
didn't have any now the important part
is<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.820> salad<00:05:52.210> needs<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.600> stay<00:05:52.900> at<00:05:53.500> least<00:05:53.530> two
