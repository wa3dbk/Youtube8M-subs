it all right show you the back it's got
the<00:00:16.529> serial<00:00:17.340> number<00:00:17.610> and<00:00:17.700> all<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> it's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the serial number and all that so it's

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.420 
the serial number and all that so it's
how<00:00:19.950> this<00:00:20.130> assistant<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:21.570> higher<00:00:22.430> comes

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
how this assistant much higher comes

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.380 
how this assistant much higher comes
with<00:00:23.610> like<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.110> cushioning<00:00:25.110> for<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> card

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.910 

let's<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> connectors<00:00:36.440> Izzy<00:00:37.440> connectors

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
let's go to connectors Izzy connectors

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.230 
let's go to connectors Izzy connectors
ok<00:00:40.920> here's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:43.160> 6<00:00:44.160> pin<00:00:44.370> power<00:00:44.580> connector<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
ok here's a 6 pin power connector if you

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.140 
ok here's a 6 pin power connector if you
don't<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.580> pin<00:00:50.580> power

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
don't have one here is the a pin power

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.210 
don't have one here is the a pin power
connector<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:58.280> now<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> lot<00:00:59.880> of<00:00:59.910> fun

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
can see all the memory and stuff in the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.949 
can see all the memory and stuff in the
back<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.799> there's<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> one<00:03:06.510> core<00:03:07.510> right

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
back and there's the one core right

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.110 
back and there's the one core right
there<00:03:09.120> that's<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.269> one<00:03:10.360> GPU<00:03:10.750> core<00:03:11.140> alright<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
there that's the one GPU core alright so

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.220 
there that's the one GPU core alright so
that<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.570> Titan<00:03:16.959> guys<00:03:17.170> let's<00:03:17.799> get<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.190> in

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that is the Titan guys let's get it in
