00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that I have this blackout I need to get

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.940 
that I have this blackout I need to get
busy<00:00:45.079> what<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> did<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> modify<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:48.739> was<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.890> took

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
busy what I did to modify it was I took

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.290 
busy what I did to modify it was I took
a<00:00:54.379> carriage<00:00:55.379> bolt<00:00:55.699> quarter-twenty<00:00:56.699> carriage

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
a carriage bolt quarter-twenty carriage

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
a carriage bolt quarter-twenty carriage
bolt<00:00:57.890> put<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.160> lathe<00:00:59.780> turned<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> down

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
bolt put it in my lathe turned it down

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.329 
bolt put it in my lathe turned it down
so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.280> front<00:01:02.640> edge<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> flat<00:01:04.339> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so the this front edge here is flat and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
so the this front edge here is flat and
then<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.909> cut<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
then I just cut this off to make it a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
then I just cut this off to make it a
little<00:01:07.710> smaller<00:01:08.010> diameter<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.439> found<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> piece

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
little smaller diameter I found a piece

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
little smaller diameter I found a piece
of<00:01:11.100> half-inch<00:01:11.909> square<00:01:12.830> steel<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:15.570> drilled

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
of half-inch square steel and I drilled

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
of half-inch square steel and I drilled
two<00:01:16.259> holes<00:01:17.780> for<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.280> 1024<00:01:20.360> screws<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.770> screw<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
two holes for a 1024 screws to screw it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
two holes for a 1024 screws to screw it
to<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> base<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> drilled<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to this base here and I drilled it and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.679 
to this base here and I drilled it and
tapped<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> quarter-twenty<00:01:29.689> running

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
tapped it for the quarter-twenty running

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.069 
tapped it for the quarter-twenty running
this<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.450> screws<00:01:33.930> at

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this way and then this little screws at

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
this way and then this little screws at
440<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.329> adjusted

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
440 so that when I get this adjusted

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
440 so that when I get this adjusted
where<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.130> set<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> set<00:01:39.420> screw

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
where I want it I can set the set screw

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
where I want it I can set the set screw
against<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.450> lock<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.780> place<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:44.119> have

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
against it and lock it in place I have

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
against it and lock it in place I have
it<00:01:45.240> set<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:48.479> cut<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.930> off<00:01:49.909> right

can handle yours this is the three here
at<00:02:19.510> brass<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.340> back<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.610> up<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.330> lock

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
at brass so I can back that up and lock

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.420 
at brass so I can back that up and lock
it<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.870> place<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.140> when<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.650> need<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:24.010> cut<00:02:24.220> off

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
it in place for when I need to cut off

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.910 
it in place for when I need to cut off
more<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.790> those<00:02:27.450> fully<00:02:28.450> adjustable<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.650> only

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
more of those fully adjustable the only

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.830 
more of those fully adjustable the only
trick<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.849> making<00:02:31.239> sure<00:02:31.269> your<00:02:31.569> brass

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
trick is gonna be making sure your brass

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440 
trick is gonna be making sure your brass
is<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.470> square<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.790> may<00:02:34.120> make<00:02:34.420> a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
is in there square and I may make a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.630 
is in there square and I may make a
little<00:02:34.780> wedge<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.410> put<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.769> underneath<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.430> so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
little wedge to put in underneath it so

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.750 
little wedge to put in underneath it so
you<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.790> set<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.299> down<00:02:37.360> on<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> brass<00:02:38.760> shut

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you just set that down on the brass shut

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.400 
you just set that down on the brass shut
the<00:02:39.879> brass<00:02:40.090> down<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.599> on<00:02:40.720> top<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> little

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
the brass down in on top of a little

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.670
