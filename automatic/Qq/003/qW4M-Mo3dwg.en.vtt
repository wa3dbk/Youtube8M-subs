get<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.480> work<00:00:46.629> with<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.989> same<00:00:47.199> thing<00:00:47.410> like

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
get to work with the same thing like

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.280 
get to work with the same thing like
robots<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.430> programming<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.450> now<00:00:49.660> robotics

robots and programming the now robotics

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.040 
robots and programming the now robotics
helps<00:00:50.680> them<00:00:51.000> take<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.180> fruition<00:00:52.390> what<00:00:52.899> they've

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
helps them take to fruition what they've

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.299 
helps them take to fruition what they've
done<00:00:53.230> on<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.469> computers<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.219> with

done on the computers and with

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.520 
done on the computers and with
programming<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.059> such<00:00:55.270> so<00:00:55.750> when<00:00:55.899> I<00:00:55.930> first<00:00:56.230> saw

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
programming and such so when I first saw

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.190 
programming and such so when I first saw
no<00:00:56.800> I<00:00:57.129> was<00:00:57.309> shocked<00:00:57.640> because<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.480> was<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> real

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
no I was shocked because it was a real

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.350 
no I was shocked because it was a real
robot<00:00:59.680> like<00:00:59.950> standing<00:01:00.579> right<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:00.789> front<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.210> me

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
robot like standing right in front of me

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.219 
robot like standing right in front of me
I<00:01:01.570> was<00:01:02.140> like<00:01:02.309> wow<00:01:03.309> I<00:01:03.760> can't<00:01:04.570> believe<00:01:04.660> I'm

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
I was like wow I can't believe I'm

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.070 
I was like wow I can't believe I'm
looking<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.950> real<00:01:06.280> bed<00:01:06.460> right<00:01:06.670> now<00:01:07.080> we've

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
looking at a real bed right now we've

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.859 
looking at a real bed right now we've
done<00:01:08.350> hour<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.160> code<00:01:09.369> last<00:01:09.940> year<00:01:10.300> before<00:01:10.630> we

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
done hour of code last year before we

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.120 
done hour of code last year before we
just<00:01:11.080> did<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.440> touchscreen<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:12.039> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
just did on the touchscreen on the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.219 
just did on the touchscreen on the
computer<00:01:12.580> but<00:01:12.940> now<00:01:13.090> we<00:01:13.149> have<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> computing

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
computer but now we have the computing

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.870 
computer but now we have the computing
robots<00:01:14.560> here<00:01:14.770> actually<00:01:14.950> walking<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:15.700> talking

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
robots here actually walking and talking

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.700 
robots here actually walking and talking
and<00:01:16.300> engaging<00:01:16.660> so<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> kids<00:01:17.320> are<00:01:17.470> really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
and engaging so the kids are really

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.820 
and engaging so the kids are really
ripped<00:01:17.920> about<00:01:18.190> doing<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:20.050> way<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.470> program

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
ripped about doing it the way to program

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.699 
ripped about doing it the way to program
now<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.849> we<00:01:22.240> fund<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:22.810> easy<00:01:23.110> for<00:01:23.500> kids

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
now is we fund so easy for kids

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.330 
now is we fund so easy for kids
especially<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> elementary<00:01:25.149> level<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
especially in the elementary level the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.699 
especially in the elementary level the
second<00:01:27.759> thing<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.479> way<00:01:28.630> now<00:01:29.080> looks<00:01:29.410> its

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
second thing is the way now looks its

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.029 
second thing is the way now looks its
design<00:01:30.160> its<00:01:30.490> appearance<00:01:31.240> its<00:01:31.599> size<00:01:32.020> its<00:01:32.560> sound

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
design its appearance its size its sound

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.710 
design its appearance its size its sound
are<00:01:33.490> really<00:01:34.149> crucial<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.970> like<00:01:37.149> who<00:01:37.390> do<00:01:37.599> we

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
are really crucial I was like who do we

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.749 
are really crucial I was like who do we
get<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.990> work<00:01:38.170> with<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.310> say<00:01:39.490> yes

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
get to work with it and then I say yes

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.460 
get to work with it and then I say yes
you<00:01:40.030> do<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.539> program<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.289> turn

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
you do you get to program it to turn

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.100 
you do you get to program it to turn
right<00:01:42.130> live<00:01:42.520> my<00:01:42.729> degrees<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.720> stuff<00:01:43.990> like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
right live my degrees and stuff like

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.779 
right live my degrees and stuff like
that<00:01:44.349> it's<00:01:44.590> showing<00:01:45.009> us<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.160> whole<00:01:45.399> different

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
that it's showing us a whole different

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.180 
that it's showing us a whole different
way<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:45.970> sign<00:01:46.539> or<00:01:46.929> we<00:01:47.050> have<00:01:47.200> like<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.410> textbook<00:01:47.890> at

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
way a sign or we have like a textbook at

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.910 
way a sign or we have like a textbook at
your<00:01:48.280> inferencing<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.390> what's<00:01:49.840> happening<00:01:50.319> but

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
your inferencing of what's happening but

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.450 
your inferencing of what's happening but
here<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.280> actually<00:01:51.429> get<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.940> do<00:01:52.119> it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.670 

we<00:01:56.460> brought<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> robot<00:01:57.690> into<00:01:58.440> our

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we brought the robot into our

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
we brought the robot into our
after-school<00:01:59.370> program<00:01:59.760> which<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.930> called<00:02:01.170> the

after-school program which is called the
think<00:02:01.560> program<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.850> robot<00:02:03.360> talked<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.230> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
think program the robot talked about the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
think program the robot talked about the
importance<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.460> nutrition<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.540> being

importance of nutrition and being

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
importance of nutrition and being
physically<00:02:07.560> active<00:02:07.940> now<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.570> home<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
physically active now when I go home I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.400 
physically active now when I go home I
can<00:02:10.200> tell<00:02:10.710> my<00:02:10.860> family<00:02:11.070> how<00:02:11.490> how<00:02:12.210> like<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.720> how

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can tell my family how how like they how

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.590 
can tell my family how how like they how
I<00:02:13.440> worked<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.100> her<00:02:14.400> robot<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
I worked out with her robot and then I
