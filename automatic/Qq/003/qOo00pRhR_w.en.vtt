 like ricotta try to find the one that does not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.260

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760

 You can eat all this and well 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 you know your doctor has already told you that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.020
 salt is dangerous for you so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 let's be careful with the use of salt 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.889
 I'm going to add a little salt to this 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.329
 cottage cheese and now let's mix it well 

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:07.050
 these ingredients look at the chile 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.120
 poblano 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.920
 together with the cottage cheese, see how nice 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.049
 color is grabbing 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 very well here is very well mixed 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.490
 Remember salt minced poblano chile 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 supposed parties that are learning 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 to cook put the chile on fire 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.580
 poblano that that shell is well roasted 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 put it in a plastic bag the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.670
 sierra do not let it go so this 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 the cascarita is loosening later 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 they left it in the water not need it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 you like oil at all and we're going 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.189
 to put some tortillas here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.619
 warm a little to soften it and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.840
 add this cottage cheese these can be 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 golden tacos but without any oil 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 we are simply going to resort to the flame 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 low so we do not go toasting little 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.330
 Look, my little ones are already tender 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 tortillas now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.470
 add two tablespoons of cottage cheese I'll 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.539
 scatter here and we're going to close for 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.280
 make our curd cheese taquitos and 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.259
 I'm going to put on low heat so this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.780
 go toasting little by little we go 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
 making another good taquito and what 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.120
 it seems if to accompany these rich 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 tacos let's make a salsita this is 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 a coconut miller recipe my dad and I'm going 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 to put onion tomatoes and something 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.700
 jalapeÃ±o for those friends who do not 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.770
 they are used to the chile no se 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 worry what can be omitted or add 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.280
 red pepper to a very rich flavor 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.800
 style Mexican fajitas and I will add 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.310
 a little bit of salt and let's go to the pan 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.230
 to put this here to cook 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 good if you feel that your salsita 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 begins to hit throws a little more than 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.800
 water until they are well cooked and the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.170
 elements look over here are mine and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.810
 release the juice and there goes to our 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.640
 little chip to put on 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.989

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.459
 Toasted toast leave them for a while 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.020
