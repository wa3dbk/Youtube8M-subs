hi<00:00:00.570> c-sharp<00:00:01.140> and<00:00:01.410> what<00:00:01.890> we'll<00:00:02.010> look<00:00:02.159> at<00:00:02.280> today

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hi c-sharp and what we'll look at today

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi c-sharp and what we'll look at today
is<00:00:02.580> some<00:00:03.510> collision<00:00:03.899> detection<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> move

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
is some collision detection how to move

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.880 
is some collision detection how to move
the<00:00:05.430> keys<00:00:06.000> how<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> use<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.350> keys<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.710> move

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
the keys how to use the keys to move

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.640 
the keys how to use the keys to move
across<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.519> screen<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.349> then<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> make

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
across the screen and then how to make

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.360 
across the screen and then how to make
the<00:00:11.070> whole<00:00:11.250> thing<00:00:11.280> animate<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:12.920> using<00:00:13.920> images

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the whole thing animate now using images

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
the whole thing animate now using images
that<00:00:14.519> you've<00:00:14.639> done<00:00:14.849> from<00:00:15.059> before<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.750> can

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that you've done from before you can

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.269 
that you've done from before you can
create<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> simple<00:00:16.410> game<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.800> what<00:00:17.160> we're

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
create a simple game and what we're

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
create a simple game and what we're
going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.840> take<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> look<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.230> one

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
going to do is take a look at this one

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870 
going to do is take a look at this one
right<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.680> fully<00:00:19.980> animated<00:00:20.310> keyboard

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
right here fully animated keyboard

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.730 
right here fully animated keyboard
detection<00:00:21.390> alright<00:00:22.050> that's<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> program

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
detection alright that's the program

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.980 
detection alright that's the program
we're<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.750> basically<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
we're going to look at and basically it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
we're going to look at and basically it
has<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.170> panel<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> screen<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.480> no<00:00:27.480> picture

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
has a panel on the screen and no picture

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
has a panel on the screen and no picture
boxes<00:00:28.170> alright<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> do

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
boxes alright so what we're going to do

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.490 
boxes alright so what we're going to do
in<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.519> particular<00:00:29.699> application<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:31.289> used

in this particular application is used

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.250 
in this particular application is used
purely<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> graphic<00:00:32.850> object<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:33.780> we're

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
purely the graphic object now we're

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.450 
purely the graphic object now we're
going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> keyboard<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> few

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
going to use the keyboard in a few

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.950 
going to use the keyboard in a few
minutes<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> key<00:00:36.329> properties

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
minutes and one of the key properties

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.250 
minutes and one of the key properties
you<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.440> set<00:00:37.680> before<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.460> let<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you have to set before you let the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.240 
you have to set before you let the
keyboard<00:00:41.450> activate<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.350> properties<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
keyboard activate is in properties and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
keyboard activate is in properties and
it's<00:00:44.370> called

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
it's called

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.299 
it's called

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to make sure that you're clicked on the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.100 
to make sure that you're clicked on the
form<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:51.210> when<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.600> over<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> right

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
form and when you go over to the right

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
form and when you go over to the right
hand<00:00:52.230> side<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.649> key<00:00:52.890> previewed<00:00:53.460> true<00:00:53.789> okay

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
hand side this key previewed true okay

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
hand side this key previewed true okay
so<00:00:54.180> make<00:00:54.510> sure<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.780> set<00:00:55.170> otherwise<00:00:55.739> when

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so make sure that's set otherwise when

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.130 
so make sure that's set otherwise when
we<00:00:56.219> start<00:00:56.550> using<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.270> keys<00:00:57.539> whatever<00:00:57.899> Keys

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we start using the keys whatever Keys

we start using the keys whatever Keys
you're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> decide<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> your

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you're going to decide to use in your

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
you're going to decide to use in your
game<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.699> won't<00:00:59.910> pick<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
game it won't pick them up because of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
game it won't pick them up because of
that<00:01:01.379> property<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.219> being<00:01:02.520> set<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.420> right

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that property not being set all right

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
that property not being set all right
now<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> run<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.949> program<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.489> don't

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
now when you run this program I don't

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
now when you run this program I don't
know<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> remember<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> basic

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
know if you remember it's just a basic

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
know if you remember it's just a basic
program<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.799> has<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.700> object<00:01:09.150> falling<00:01:09.390> from

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
program it has an object falling from

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
program it has an object falling from
the<00:01:09.780> sky<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> man<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the sky and you have the man at the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
the sky and you have the man at the
bottom<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> basketball<00:01:13.110> player

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
bottom which is that basketball player

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.429 
bottom which is that basketball player
and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.490> move<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.700> J<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> L<00:01:15.750> keys<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.259> go

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and I can move my J and L keys to go

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.210 
and I can move my J and L keys to go
left<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.950> right

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
left and right

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.719 
left and right
and<00:01:18.080> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.950> gets<00:01:20.159> hit<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> head<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and if you can gets hit in the head it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
and if you can gets hit in the head it
bounces<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> other<00:01:21.420> way<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bounces up the other way all right so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.960 
bounces up the other way all right so
let's<00:01:22.740> take<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> code<00:01:23.729> that's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
let's take a look at all the code that's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.749 
let's take a look at all the code that's
necessary<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.049> program<00:01:25.650> work<00:01:25.860> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
necessary to make this program work like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
necessary to make this program work like
I<00:01:26.880> mentioned<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.470> using

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I mentioned we're not going to be using

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
I mentioned we're not going to be using
picture<00:01:28.979> boxes<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> very

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
picture boxes at all so at the very

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.050 
picture boxes at all so at the very
beginning<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> program<00:01:31.520> what<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
beginning of the program what you do is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.700 
beginning of the program what you do is
you<00:01:33.240> declare<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.400> different<00:01:35.880> image

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
you declare all the different image

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.600 
you declare all the different image
objects<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.520> you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
across the screen so that value is
always<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> be<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.010> set<00:03:26.340> number<00:03:26.730> then

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
always going to be that set number then

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.390 
always going to be that set number then
I'm<00:03:27.840> going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.290> draw<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.590> background<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
I'm going to draw the background and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.979 
I'm going to draw the background and
this<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.850> kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.180> way<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.390> wipe<00:03:30.750> out

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
this is kind of a way to wipe out

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.870 
this is kind of a way to wipe out
whatever<00:03:31.380> was<00:03:31.680> there<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:31.920> few<00:03:32.190> minutes<00:03:32.459> ago<00:03:32.579> and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
whatever was there a few minutes ago and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.610 
whatever was there a few minutes ago and
with<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> new<00:03:33.660> image<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.140> gives<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
with a new image so that gives you the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.020 
with a new image so that gives you the
impression<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.310> moving<00:03:35.519> down<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
impression that it's moving down the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.690 
impression that it's moving down the
screen<00:03:36.329> this<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.470> how<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> make<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.220> computer

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
screen this is how I make the computer

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.539 
screen this is how I make the computer
figure<00:03:39.390> out<00:03:39.510> what<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.900> go<00:03:40.019> down<00:03:40.230> by<00:03:40.500> alright<00:03:41.100> so

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
figure out what to go down by alright so

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.479 
figure out what to go down by alright so
image<00:03:41.910> direct<00:03:42.329> image<00:03:42.870> direction<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:44.069> set<00:03:44.370> at

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
image direct image direction is set at

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.840 
image direct image direction is set at
one<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:46.440> times<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.010> by<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.250> panel<00:03:47.670> height

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
one and I times that by the panel height

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.280 
one and I times that by the panel height
divided<00:03:48.209> by<00:03:48.239> 100<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> go<00:03:48.959> down<00:03:49.139> in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
divided by 100 so I go down in

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.410 
divided by 100 so I go down in
hundredths<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.489> size<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> screen

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
hundredths of the size of the screen

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.780 
hundredths of the size of the screen
okay<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> screen<00:03:52.889> was<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.130> thousand

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
okay so if the screen was a thousand

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.050 
okay so if the screen was a thousand
I'll<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:53.970> going<00:03:54.269> down<00:03:54.450> by<00:03:54.780> 10<00:03:55.139> every<00:03:55.829> time<00:03:56.100> all

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
I'll be going down by 10 every time all

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.879 
I'll be going down by 10 every time all
right<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.750> how<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.959> draw<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.470> ball

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
right this is how you draw the ball

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.069 
right this is how you draw the ball
dropping<00:03:59.430> from<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.940> screen<00:04:00.269> remember<00:04:00.780> it's

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
dropping from the screen remember it's

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.170 
dropping from the screen remember it's
always<00:04:01.260> going<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.650> at<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.859> position<00:04:02.069> X<00:04:02.489> so

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
always going to be at a position X so

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.340 
always going to be at a position X so
it's<00:04:03.299> always<00:04:03.420> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.690> be<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.019> middle

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
it's always going to be in the middle

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.990 
it's always going to be in the middle
and<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> number<00:04:05.639> that's<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.940> to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
and this is the number that's going to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.569 
and this is the number that's going to
change<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:07.019> man<00:04:07.260> along<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> bottom<00:04:08.010> he's

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
change the man along the bottom he's

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.870 
change the man along the bottom he's
always<00:04:08.880> going<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.269> be<00:04:09.329> at<00:04:09.569> this<00:04:10.230> height<00:04:10.920> okay

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
always going to be at this height okay

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.400 
always going to be at this height okay
so<00:04:11.940> he's<00:04:12.209> not<00:04:12.359> going<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.569> go<00:04:12.690> up<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.019> down<00:04:13.049> he's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
so he's not going to go up or down he's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.750 
so he's not going to go up or down he's
just<00:04:13.470> going<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.769> go<00:04:13.859> sideways<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.519> only

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
just going to go sideways the only

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.159 
just going to go sideways the only
number<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.060> going<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.269> change<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.780> him<00:04:15.989> is

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
number is going to change for him is

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.000 
number is going to change for him is
that<00:04:16.769> x<00:04:17.010> value<00:04:17.750> okay<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:19.169> let's<00:04:19.440> skip<00:04:19.859> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
that x value okay now let's skip the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.070 
that x value okay now let's skip the
collision<00:04:20.430> for<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.639> second<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.150> let's<00:04:21.539> jump<00:04:21.840> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
collision for a second and let's jump to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.440 
collision for a second and let's jump to
how<00:04:22.289> he<00:04:22.349> moves<00:04:22.710> when<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.520> put<00:04:23.940> your<00:04:24.090> finger

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
how he moves when you put your finger

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.450 
how he moves when you put your finger
down<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.840> key

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
down the key

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.850 
down the key
if<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.789> press<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.240> L<00:04:26.419> key<00:04:26.720> he<00:04:27.289> moves<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
if you press the L key he moves to the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.070 
if you press the L key he moves to the
right<00:04:28.100> by<00:04:28.400> 5<00:04:28.699> if<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:28.970> press<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.509> J<00:04:29.720> key<00:04:29.930> he

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
right by 5 if you press the J key he

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.379 
right by 5 if you press the J key he
moves<00:04:30.289> backwards<00:04:30.800> by<00:04:30.979> 5<00:04:31.280> all<00:04:32.150> right

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
moves backwards by 5 all right

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.330 
moves backwards by 5 all right
and<00:04:32.479> now<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.930> collision<00:04:33.530> as<00:04:33.650> we<00:04:33.979> mentioned

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
and now the collision as we mentioned

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.950 
and now the collision as we mentioned
before<00:04:34.370> with<00:04:34.789> collision<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.360> takes<00:04:35.600> four

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
before with collision it takes four

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.740 
before with collision it takes four
components<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:37.190> figure<00:04:37.550> out<00:04:37.699> collision<00:04:38.360> okay

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
components to figure out collision okay

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.900 
components to figure out collision okay
so<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.259> have<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.680> figure<00:04:39.919> out<00:04:40.160> if<00:04:40.400> he's<00:04:40.699> gone

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
so you have to figure out if he's gone

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.640 
so you have to figure out if he's gone
over<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> bit<00:04:41.600> from<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.840> left<00:04:42.020> from<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.470> right

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
over a bit from the left from the right

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.170 
over a bit from the left from the right
from<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:43.009> top<00:04:43.250> from<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.610> bottom<00:04:44.030> and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
from the top from the bottom and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.659 
from the top from the bottom and
basically<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.889> collision<00:04:46.130> routine

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
basically this is the collision routine

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.719 
basically this is the collision routine
and<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.060> he<00:04:47.509> hits<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:48.080> particular<00:04:48.770> spot<00:04:49.070> he

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
and if he hits a particular spot he

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.370 
and if he hits a particular spot he
bounces<00:04:50.180> back<00:04:50.419> up<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:50.990> changed<00:04:51.320> the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
bounces back up and you changed the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.770 
bounces back up and you changed the
direction<00:04:51.759> all<00:04:52.759> right<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:52.970> that's<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.240> basic

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
direction all right so that's the basic

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.710 
direction all right so that's the basic
movement<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.759> how<00:04:55.759> you<00:04:55.820> move<00:04:56.180> things<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.630> the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
movement and how you move things in the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.570 
movement and how you move things in the
very<00:04:56.900> bottom<00:04:57.080> obviously<00:04:57.320> is<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.190> cycling

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
very bottom obviously is the cycling

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.820 
very bottom obviously is the cycling
through
