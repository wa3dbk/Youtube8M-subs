00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hello everyone in today's video, I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.230
 talk about how to set up 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 slimming 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.570
 why do it why is it important personally 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.580
 I think that this is just me. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.119
 I think that everyone should sit down and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.550
 to think 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.130
 you need it you really want 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 lose weight is really your desire 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.119
 it's not because there is a friend of you 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.199
 said some folds appeared or 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 you look bad 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.289
 or is it because the young man 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.510
 said I would like to see you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.790
 country you really do it yourself 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 want because if you want 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 lose weight only wright to wear 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.670
 clothes smaller 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 then the result is likely to keep you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 just will not work this way you 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.969
 likely to sit on the right 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.670
 food as much talk and sit 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.649
 I do not know there 5 days and the weekend is again like 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 usually there I do not know the guests holidays 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.280
 the cafe I think that proper nutrition 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.930
 it's just a lifestyle 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 this is not some kind of diet hard 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 limitations you can eat everything that you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.030
 just want to learn to respect 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 balance don't have to live for food live for 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 slimming 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.119
 because I think that we hope 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 that most people have in life 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.280
 are there any other care goals 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 one must live for the sake of harmony in oneself 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 close people for the sake of health for the sake of relatives 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 just to live and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.400
 enjoy life she is with us only 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 live alone for weight loss 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
 when the thought of how 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 lose weight how to lose weight although maybe you 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.590
 it is not necessary to me it seems that it is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.479
 a little bit silly so you have to sit down and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.329
 understand yourself understand your 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.280
 head why you need it for weight loss 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.280
 losing weight is some strange task 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 Well, you have lost weight and what's next, well 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.880
 Here are the best size smaller blade 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 there in some kind of dress and then what 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 if the goal was only the weight loss itself 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 chances are you then relax and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 Gain extra kilos you even yourself 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 don't notice how plus 1 plus 2 seems to be 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 not much mirror changed afterwards 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 look at all 10 kilos I returned 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 I think that many people have come across 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.909
 this problem and then just because 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.710
 they don't know 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.840
 nothing lose weight they did not understand 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.480
 before it starts doing exactly 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.760
 that's why I'm talking about the network settings itself. 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.030
 I do not know write on a piece of paper why do you 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 it is necessary and find some weight loss 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.620
 another higher goal 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.709
 because when you lose weight you may not 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.260
 You will be satisfied with yourself and at this moment you 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.330
 You might think I'm so much the case 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.040
 my reflection is still not happy 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.080
 because not a fact when you will 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.810
 weigh that same treasured figure you'll 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 look like you imagined 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 so try to just be better 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.489
 what we were yesterday and then you can 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.470
 hear cultivate all your 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.910
 life and then it seems to me that you have 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.010
 get to live somehow in some kind 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.510
 harmony with yourself you will be easier 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.970
 treat what you don't see 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.769
 some figure you don't know the wrong volume 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.349
 Is there something else you'll just understand 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.000
 that yes, I may not be like that now 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.609
 such as i would like to be 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.049
 but if I continue to do something if 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.730
 I will do it competently then I have it 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.799
 It turns out I think it's just 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 great idea to transcend yourself 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.599
 yesterday's yesterday because it 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.489
 will push you further and further 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.079
 move forward on this keeps 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.239
 the whole sport because most often 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.650
 athlete because they are not just you played 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.870
 some kind of competition and then all my life 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.030
 try to beat your fingers 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.200
 results ie they try to be in 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.480
 next time in the next competition 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.150
 and better than they were before 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.780
 and it helps them to carry out part of life 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.130
 this physical work on yourself 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.720
 the same can be said about people 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.090
 who are constantly learning mental 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.549
 work they just try to find out everything 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.109
 more and more of something new to 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.510
 tomorrow to be smarter than you were yesterday 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.400
 find a goal just to be better 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.620
 than yesterday it will help you not only 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.599
 lose weight it will help you and heal 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.030
 find some active life 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.730
 new new emotions of some kind 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.109
 sensations that's why it seems to me here 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.690
 many people manage to achieve 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.000
 here's a success today 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.269
 I would just like to get infected 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.790
 this idea to live actively stop better 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.469
 with every 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.750
 because so you can just 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.939
 watch how your life boils they just 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.799
 flows past their opinions on this topic 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.810
 leave in the comments under the video 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.359
 maybe you don't know agree with me 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.639
 don't agree no matter just write what 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.530
 you think how you live what you 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.240
 can you give someone advice if 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.650
 something that really catches me 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.350
 then simply tell about it in more 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 one video and in general I will go find out 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.110
 I want something new for today 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.400
