00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:22.079
 with the staff all to eito the cerato segment now our part said the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.970
 doctor 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.220
 another agent will see how we do to make three types of events 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.519
 three peaks 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.749
 one of them the media says 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.320
 which has two properties my property on it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.110
 david and monaco 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.950
 one followed straight into two equal halves 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.620
 or rather saying two parts two segments 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.750
 with the same instant size and second 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.480
 He passes through the woods. 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.900
 split the tournament 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 divided into two equal halves we will help myself 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.010
 as we learn to do 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.460
 the credit segment up to 24 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 to one end of the line 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.479
 the case 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.590
 when rating 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.399
 and the third will be the following we have a point c externalized beretta 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.619
 and at this price we will want to pass a person a crime of embezzlement through 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.430
 concept 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460
 perpendicular and kleber 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.170
 other three cases 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 first case afonso are from the actress actress 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.000
 The first thing I'm going to hit the bar 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 and occupy the compass 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 with a larger meter 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 than about half of the segment 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 because if it is smaller 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.090
 the two straight did not cross with the Argentinean now comes 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.120
 would have reattached 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.689
 the Briton who died al-qaeda widened with a goal 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.360
 open a little bigger than she 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 is not the focus that the medium this time I saw much bigger than the problem 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 I'll take a risk 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.240
 You'll have the embezzlement. It's no problem. It's going to have a problem, because it's going to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.700
 I soon took anyone 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 the greatest actor 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 than half 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 I do 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.350
 a risk upon 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 I'll take another low risk. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.969
 folks played a subway train she sucks 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.600
 so we can not focus once in a while but soon after that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.129
 the floor scratches over drizzle shipments 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.949
 with the same measure I did not crash in autumn and time 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.859
 I'll take care of it. 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.109
 cory aquino public 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.099
 and I'm getting married again 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.389
 the teaching segment 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.769
 lose a classic 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.190
 on top of a bow 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.479
 the segment since marcio 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.439
 at the crossing point 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.609
 but little at this point 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.609
 he contributes in the month I go I am that point said 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 I like but little to have 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.509
 I'm going to get the athlete who came back 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.929
 put on 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.049
 on here 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 however in reverse 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709
 Now yes 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.419
 there is a month or less punctual service I was then spared 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.150
 It's going to be me, I shared the power. 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.930
 and in competing ports 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.800
 and besides this one here 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.800
 You're a little better with your agent melting. 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 this segment is severely 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.259
 jacques says 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.129
 step by step 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.339
 the next step 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.820
 because the segment b 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.640
 I want to marry a pure perpendicular clÃ´ agree how I do it 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.039
 catch another athlete 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.129
 cook 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.269
 blow 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.849
 look a little 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.799
 that I'm going to convince you 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.339
 I do not know if you'll see. 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.539
 with that thread 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.809
 what do I do now? 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:52.979
 I will take 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.099
 the tire 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.459
 with a goal 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.459
 fixed by color 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.759
 coverage what was 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.939
 a team a little bit with the pope 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.939
 team a little bit 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.599
 I'll do 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.829
 Yes, a vote here has a person who this side 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.879
 I made a song 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.709
 I stayed with Katie. 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.709
 cb 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.860
 Our lady stays here, my daughter. 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.599
 the agent does the following we will increase the size of the opening 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.639
 and we will do as we can know what 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.499
 we're going to make a segment 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.719
 it's the dividing 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.170
 first public service through this 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.449
 I am because 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.680
 Cosmi pms that a ray 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.009
 only that the other ray these two segments are very distant 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.909
 in relation to the body 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.080
 I'm going to fight 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.150
 because the bric 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.930
 norberto is the greatest 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.460
 than the segment 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.710
 foot, I'll be over there 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.050
 brought me a little 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.789
 precarious work being 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.389
 I did it here 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.650
 that here 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.629
 or even measure 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.189
 in the east gaucho same compass 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.990
 nor the score 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.520
 up here 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.699
 down here 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.460
 almost change 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 I'll make another room there 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.870
 I'll have to decorate 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.460
 I can say that 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.319
 this point here 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.409
 south valley this straight 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.829
 is what I'm going to say it means is that the pec 4 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.410
 the br 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.120
 for little 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.400
 the third thing that your building is going to do now 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.520
 will be a perpendicular 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.009
 but it's past because you know 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.009
 through concepts like that I do this 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.319
 missed 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.460
 in Tokyo point 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.309
 do not pass me over it's everything 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:01.710
 pardon 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.990
 the retarder segment 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.990
 with br 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.719
 already with the keirrison of clemente rosa 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.610
 stay here my daughter 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.199
 do it the following 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.490
 therefore 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.490
 I'll get the right spot. 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:25.680
 and with the brightness 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.550
 little pigs july 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.009
 your life 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.089
 I need to use 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.629
 had to eat 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.310
 our goal is the following will cross the part of the council 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.400
 someone nick a stitch so few years here 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 and the cruise here 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.839
 do it now 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.399
 when I'm a bit decently but I hope it's not confusing that I 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.860
 you any doubt you ask and that we hide 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.550
 koki 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.490
 Then I can change as I 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.930
 only with the sus the same the important here this measurement 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.189
 be greater 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.149
 that the midpoint distances 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:06.439
 taking over 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.619
 such as the fifth as bait 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.399
 that here 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.009
 the agreement with d 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.909
 That's down here. 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.909
 now the risk here 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:23.270
 and search down 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.320
 did not give a taste or leaning against the rock and a little bit 

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.059
 the bass composer happened because 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:34.059
 youtube videos in ten minutes 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.089
 What am I going to do now 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:40.240
 I go back to the parsley with the three points 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.240
 3 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:47.870
 This is going to be the zip code to open. 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.009
 passing percent 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:51.100
 the people 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.339
 beauty 

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.979
 then we will continue with other constructions is the most then
