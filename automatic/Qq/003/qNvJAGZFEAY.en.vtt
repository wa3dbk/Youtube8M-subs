why I'm doing this I know everyone heat

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
why I'm doing this I know everyone heat
ads<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.220> by<00:01:17.640> enabling<00:01:17.909> ads<00:01:18.270> early<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.049> will

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
ads but by enabling ads early on I will

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.890 
ads but by enabling ads early on I will
have<00:01:19.380> created<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.770> long<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.780> priority<00:01:21.780> with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
have created a long time priority with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
have created a long time priority with
advertisers<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> means<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> later<00:01:23.909> on

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
advertisers what this means is later on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.399 
advertisers what this means is later on
in<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.210> future<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> channel<00:01:25.080> does<00:01:25.259> grow

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
in the future when the channel does grow

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.819 
in the future when the channel does grow
larger<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> priority<00:01:27.540> on

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
larger we will have a priority on

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.080 
larger we will have a priority on
meaning<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.130> revenue<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.729> coming<00:01:30.030> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
meaning more revenue will be coming in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.190 
meaning more revenue will be coming in
to<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> channel<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.720> means<00:01:30.780> better

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to the channel which means better

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
to the channel which means better
content<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> channel<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
content for the channel I'm not going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.539 
content for the channel I'm not going to
be<00:01:33.509> spending<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.869> cent<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.650> channel<00:01:35.430> earn

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
be spending a cent of the channel earn

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.550 
be spending a cent of the channel earn
money<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:37.110> related<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
money on things not related to the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
money on things not related to the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
channel so I'll be spending entirely on

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.889 
channel so I'll be spending entirely on
you<00:01:39.780> set<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:41.159> better<00:01:41.640> equipment<00:01:42.000> software<00:01:42.720> for

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
you set a better equipment software for

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.280 
you set a better equipment software for
stop-motions<00:01:43.439> etc<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.549> um<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.229> don't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
stop-motions etc so um I don't I don't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.719 
stop-motions etc so um I don't I don't
do<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.829> videos<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> money<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
do these videos for the money but I

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.069 
do these videos for the money but I
figured<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.240> consistent<00:01:48.570> stream<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
figured that a consistent stream of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.359 
figured that a consistent stream of
revenue<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> channel<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.130> really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
revenue for the channel would really

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.300 
revenue for the channel would really
open<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.790> possibilities<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> future

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
open up possibilities in the future

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
open up possibilities in the future
like<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.460> those<00:01:53.579> things<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.090> said<00:01:54.409> every

like all those things I just said every

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.679 
like all those things I just said every
cent<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.100> towards<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> channel<00:01:56.880> I'll

my first animation I got a lot of

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.400 
my first animation I got a lot of
comments<00:04:40.810> about<00:04:41.639> uh<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:44.020> know<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.139> stability

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
comments about uh you know the stability

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.700 
comments about uh you know the stability
of<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.860> animation<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:46.690> what<00:04:46.810> we<00:04:46.930> have<00:04:47.080> here<00:04:48.540> is

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
of the animation so what we have here is

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
tripod with the videos I'm doing already

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.530 
tripod with the videos I'm doing already
with<00:05:05.440> date<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:06.520> one<00:05:06.700> is<00:05:06.790> really<00:05:06.940> stable<00:05:07.270> when

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
with date this one is really stable when

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.670 
with date this one is really stable when
you're<00:05:07.630> taking<00:05:07.900> picture<00:05:08.139> after<00:05:08.350> picture<00:05:08.380> it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
you're taking picture after picture it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.100 
you're taking picture after picture it
kind<00:05:08.889> of<00:05:08.950> ships<00:05:09.450> hoping<00:05:10.450> something<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.930> this

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
kind of ships hoping something like this

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.560 
kind of ships hoping something like this
would<00:05:11.290> be<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.410> lot<00:05:11.680> more<00:05:12.150> stable<00:05:13.150> when<00:05:13.479> I'm

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
would be a lot more stable when I'm

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.719 
would be a lot more stable when I'm
pressing<00:05:13.900> down<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.050> shutter<00:05:14.320> button<00:05:14.700> yeah<00:05:15.700> I

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
pressing down the shutter button yeah I

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.240 
pressing down the shutter button yeah I
think<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:16.120> will<00:05:16.240> do<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.479> trick

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
think it will do the trick
