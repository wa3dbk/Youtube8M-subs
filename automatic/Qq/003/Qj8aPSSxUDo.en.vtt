them<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> how<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.280> or

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
them like that this is how you do it or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
them like that this is how you do it or
at<00:00:44.430> least<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:44.850> I've<00:00:45.120> done<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
at least this is how I've done it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
at least this is how I've done it
draw<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> dirt<00:00:46.379> road<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.920> close<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
draw a dirt road as close as you can to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.920 
draw a dirt road as close as you can to
the<00:00:48.719> end<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.670> use<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.329> road

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the end of this and then use the up road

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130 
the end of this and then use the up road
upgrade<00:00:52.320> tool<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.100> downgrade<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.969> road<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
upgrade tool to downgrade that road so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.139 
upgrade tool to downgrade that road so
that<00:00:55.320> turns<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> normal

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
that turns this into just a normal

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
that turns this into just a normal
normal<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.579> people<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.969> going

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
normal way and so people will be going

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.520 
normal way and so people will be going
all<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.080> instead<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
all the way around here instead of just

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.520 
all the way around here instead of just
going<00:01:04.890> there<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.500> the

the stuff from the other regions but I'm

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.260 
the stuff from the other regions but I'm
running<00:02:21.709> out<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.010> power<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.640> stuff<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.060> my

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
running out of power and stuff in my

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.420 
running out of power and stuff in my

city and if I start buying it from the
regions<00:02:25.850> my<00:02:26.060> region<00:02:26.420> will<00:02:26.540> start<00:02:26.720> burning<00:02:26.930> out

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
regions my region will start burning out

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.500

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
because my region city is not that high

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.570 
because my region city is not that high
up<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:32.690> you'll<00:02:32.870> notice<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.160> buildings
