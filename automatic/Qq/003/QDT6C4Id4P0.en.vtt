00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:52.649 
mode pretty disguised ball and that's

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.010 
mode pretty disguised ball and that's
pretty<00:06:52.860> much<00:06:53.009> it<00:06:53.099> he's<00:06:53.729> very<00:06:54.000> kind<00:06:54.750> of<00:06:54.810> dull

pretty much it he's very kind of dull

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.760 
pretty much it he's very kind of dull
ever<00:06:55.710> he's<00:06:56.009> a<00:06:56.189> good<00:06:56.460> display<00:06:56.669> piece<00:06:57.740> so<00:06:58.740> I

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
ever he's a good display piece so I

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.230 
ever he's a good display piece so I
guess<00:06:58.889> that's<00:06:59.279> it<00:06:59.460> for<00:06:59.520> his<00:06:59.759> vehicle<00:07:00.210> mode

already<00:07:00.659> so<00:07:01.349> i<00:07:01.379> guess<00:07:01.560> i<00:07:01.680> could<00:07:01.800> go<00:07:01.919> on<00:07:01.949> to

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
already so i guess i could go on to

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.530 
already so i guess i could go on to
transform<00:07:02.669> him<00:07:02.849> onto<00:07:03.330> his<00:07:03.360> robot<00:07:03.689> mode
