00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.510 
the camera position properties and I'm
going<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.849> change<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.630> rotation<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:10.340> just

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
going to change the rotation so just

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.909 
going to change the rotation so just
going<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.729> hold<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.690> cursor<00:05:11.960> over<00:05:12.349> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
going to hold the cursor over the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.089 
going to hold the cursor over the
rotation<00:05:13.400> number<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:13.940> pull<00:05:14.510> to<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.260> side<00:05:15.500> as

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
rotation number and pull to the side as

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:22.700 
rotation number and pull to the side as
you<00:05:16.250> can<00:05:16.400> see<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:17.450> rotates<00:05:17.810> your<00:05:17.990> text

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:36.090 

so<00:05:23.710> I'm<00:05:24.010> going<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.280> change<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:25.800> positioning

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.909 

I<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:36.790> takes<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.300> little<00:05:37.510> bit<00:05:37.630> closer

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.119 

if<00:05:44.370> they<00:05:44.550> change<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.999> wirelessly<00:05:45.599> sorry<00:05:46.499> if<00:05:46.949> I

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
if they change the wirelessly sorry if I

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.689 
if they change the wirelessly sorry if I
change<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.490> Y<00:05:47.729> rotation<00:05:48.860> from<00:05:49.860> left<00:05:50.310> today

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
change the Y rotation from left today

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.719 
change the Y rotation from left today
let<00:05:51.689> go<00:05:51.930> you<00:05:52.560> can<00:05:52.710> see<00:05:52.919> that<00:05:53.099> your<00:05:53.219> text<00:05:53.520> is

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
let go you can see that your text is

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.100 
let go you can see that your text is
indeed<00:05:54.509> 3d<00:05:55.939> as<00:05:56.939> you<00:05:57.090> can<00:05:57.240> see<00:05:57.419> there<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.900> you

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
indeed 3d as you can see there and you

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.920 
indeed 3d as you can see there and you
can<00:05:58.259> see<00:05:58.469> it's<00:05:58.650> actually<00:05:59.159> your<00:05:59.310> image<00:05:59.930> that

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
can see it's actually your image that

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.890 
can see it's actually your image that
has<00:06:01.050> been<00:06:01.080> blended<00:06:01.590> then<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.210> text<00:06:03.629> so

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
has been blended then to the text so

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.679 
has been blended then to the text so
it's<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> really<00:06:04.319> nice<00:06:04.650> effect<00:06:05.090> so<00:06:06.090> just<00:06:06.539> come

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
it's a really nice effect so just come

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.839 
it's a really nice effect so just come
back<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.199> we'll<00:06:07.379> clear<00:06:07.650> this<00:06:10.580> and<00:06:11.580> you<00:06:11.669> can

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
back and we'll clear this and you can

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.100 
back and we'll clear this and you can
have<00:06:11.879> a<00:06:11.969> whole<00:06:12.210> lot<00:06:12.449> of<00:06:12.479> different<00:06:12.840> effects

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
have a whole lot of different effects

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.749 
have a whole lot of different effects
going<00:06:13.349> on<00:06:13.439> there<00:06:13.710> with<00:06:13.919> your<00:06:14.069> text<00:06:14.460> blowing

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
going on there with your text blowing

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:26.320 
going on there with your text blowing
apart<00:06:15.120> or<00:06:15.560> swirling<00:06:16.560> around<00:06:20.659> here

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.010 

so<00:06:26.960> we'll<00:06:27.050> just<00:06:27.259> stop<00:06:27.590> that<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:31.930> comment<00:06:32.930> down

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
so we'll just stop that and comment down

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.560 
so we'll just stop that and comment down
I'm<00:06:33.560> coming<00:06:33.979> to<00:06:34.099> waiting

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.060 

it's<00:06:42.020> going<00:06:42.170> to<00:06:42.260> change<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.680> light<00:06:42.890> in

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
it's going to change the light in

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.140 
it's going to change the light in
position<00:06:44.020> move<00:06:45.020> it<00:06:45.170> to<00:06:45.320> right<00:06:45.350> hand<00:06:45.710> side<00:06:47.770> and

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
position move it to right hand side and

00:06:49.150 --> 00:07:01.610 
position move it to right hand side and
I'm<00:06:50.150> going<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.450> increase<00:06:50.900> the<00:06:51.380> lighting<00:06:51.650> death

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.600 

so<00:07:02.190> we'll<00:07:02.520> just<00:07:02.700> play<00:07:03.480> this

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
so we'll just play this

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.610 
so we'll just play this
as<00:07:06.150> you<00:07:06.240> can<00:07:06.330> see<00:07:06.510> but<00:07:06.810> I<00:07:06.870> really<00:07:07.140> need<00:07:07.320> cool

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
as you can see but I really need cool

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.850 
as you can see but I really need cool
effect<00:07:07.980> happening<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:09.480> can<00:07:09.630> make<00:07:10.170> key<00:07:10.530> themes

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
effect happening you can make key themes

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.110 
effect happening you can make key themes
for<00:07:11.250> each<00:07:11.480> stage<00:07:12.560> to<00:07:13.560> see<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:13.920> a<00:07:14.160> change

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
for each stage to see that a change

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.760 
for each stage to see that a change
happening<00:07:15.630> stage<00:07:16.080> by<00:07:16.320> stage<00:07:18.500> so<00:07:19.500> that's

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
happening stage by stage so that's

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.920 
happening stage by stage so that's
pretty<00:07:20.010> much<00:07:20.100> you<00:07:20.730> could<00:07:20.850> also<00:07:21.060> instead<00:07:21.750> of

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
pretty much you could also instead of

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.430 
pretty much you could also instead of
having<00:07:22.230> a<00:07:22.590> image<00:07:23.810> you<00:07:24.810> could<00:07:24.930> have<00:07:25.080> created

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
having a image you could have created

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.770 
having a image you could have created
your<00:07:25.590> text<00:07:26.040> and<00:07:26.220> if<00:07:26.580> I<00:07:26.730> follow<00:07:27.150> the<00:07:27.390> exact<00:07:27.750> same

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
your text and if I follow the exact same

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.730 
your text and if I follow the exact same
procedure<00:07:28.080> but<00:07:28.830> only<00:07:29.460> the<00:07:30.390> text<00:07:30.900> to<00:07:31.380> have<00:07:31.530> been

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
placed over the top of a movie and then

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.820 
placed over the top of a movie and then
the<00:07:34.920> movie<00:07:35.340> will<00:07:35.880> actually<00:07:36.330> play<00:07:36.660> and<00:07:36.960> Sade

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830
