00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.470
 well, here's the last time we 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.569
 transplant meldonium I want you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 show here were the buds 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.950
 and now here she blossomed see three 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:20.430
 Three arrows here one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.010
 arrow 2 arrow 3 not yet fully 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.279
 grew up later it would be too 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.220
 bloom here decided to just shoot you 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.220
 show what she is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 here she was transplanted by me and after 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.430
 transplant she's already after the stores 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 Flowers have already given home they of course 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 different from store 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:57.559
 they are more of such a well-groomed appearance 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:00.840
 rumpled flower in general are amazing 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 firstly it smells smell right away 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.180
 greenhouse or home immediately will you 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 remind him of his presence 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 they certainly do not live very long as 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080
 phalaenopsis is acceptable which can 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 take half a year 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 these flowers are certainly not so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.899
 lasting two to three weeks but well here 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.530
 because there are a lot of them first one arrow 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.140
 bloom then bloom 2 arrow then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.009
 3 bloom arrow so quietly at 0 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 you stretch the flowering period so 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.580
 I like this flower a lot 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.940
 reminds how in the garden we have flowers 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.700
 grow but still it blooms round 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.440
 year with periodicity in winter and summer and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.970
 in the fall , according to the idea, constantly 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.560
 bloom occurs so start 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.289
 Meldonium, especially since she has a lot 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.740
 different colors 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:05.970
 a flower so multifaceted with different 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.750
 drawings of flowers with a smell but unity in 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.430
 he is so green nice and so 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.750
 I think that you will not 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.690
 disappointed here but if you all 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.819
