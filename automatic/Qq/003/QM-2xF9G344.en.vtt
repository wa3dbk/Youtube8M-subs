this one doesn't have any buttons

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
this one doesn't have any buttons

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
to use a sandstone but it looked kind of

crappy up here didn't didn't work well
so<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> used<00:02:18.870> stone<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.430> will<00:02:20.550> take

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
it's I find that this is kind of useless
since<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.489> right<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.269> take<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
since that one right there will take you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.840 
since that one right there will take you
all<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.140> bottom<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:31.819> yeah<00:02:32.819> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
all the way to the bottom so yeah I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.949 
all the way to the bottom so yeah I
guess<00:02:33.000> there's<00:02:33.209> really<00:02:33.269> no<00:02:33.569> point<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.900> me

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
guess there's really no point in me

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.390 
guess there's really no point in me
doing<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.260> again<00:02:34.500> society<00:02:34.950> showed<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
doing this again society showed it to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.900 
doing this again society showed it to
that<00:02:35.519> one<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:35.880> whatever<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.680> I'm<00:02:38.610> flying

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
that one but whatever and I'm flying

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.530 
that one but whatever and I'm flying
still<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.690> doesn't<00:02:39.989> help<00:02:41.299> every<00:02:42.299> time

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
still so that doesn't help every time

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.300 
still so that doesn't help every time
you<00:02:43.080> press<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.860> will<00:02:44.400> reset<00:02:44.880> itself<00:02:45.110> after

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you press it it will reset itself after

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000 
you press it it will reset itself after
you've<00:02:47.310> after<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.840> done<00:02:49.140> its<00:02:49.349> function<00:02:49.799> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you've after it's done its function and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.050 
you've after it's done its function and
then<00:02:50.130> taking<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> way<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
then taking you all the way to the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.130 
then taking you all the way to the
bottom<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.110> set<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:53.720> when<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> go<00:02:54.930> down

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
bottom so you set it when you go down

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.199 
bottom so you set it when you go down
and<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:55.829> it's<00:02:56.100> going<00:02:56.280> down<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.700> literally

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and as it's going down it literally

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.920 
and as it's going down it literally
resets<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.019> proper<00:02:58.980> RS<00:02:59.280> nor<00:02:59.489> latch<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
resets the proper RS nor latch is so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.819 
resets the proper RS nor latch is so
let's<00:03:01.079> go<00:03:01.170> take<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> look<00:03:03.079> this<00:03:04.079> wiring<00:03:04.410> from

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
let's go take a look this wiring from

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.810 
let's go take a look this wiring from
the<00:03:04.980> buttons<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.519> very<00:03:06.090> shoddy<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:07.820> just

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
the buttons is very shoddy I just

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.000 
the buttons is very shoddy I just
finished<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.989> that's<00:03:10.680> why<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:10.920> looks

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
finished it up so that's why it looks

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.710 
finished it up so that's why it looks
like<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:11.820> kind<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.209> random<00:03:12.570> but

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
like this is just kind of random but

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.330 
like this is just kind of random but
everything's<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.560> its<00:03:13.650> proper<00:03:14.040> order

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
everything's in its proper order

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.660 
everything's in its proper order
basically<00:03:15.150> what<00:03:15.269> happens<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.920> this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
basically what happens here is that this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.120 
basically what happens here is that this
button<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.420> only<00:03:18.630> activate<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.890> line

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
button will only activate this one line

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.400 
button will only activate this one line
while<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.120> button<00:03:21.540> will<00:03:21.660> activate<00:03:21.720> this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
while this button will activate this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.280 
while this button will activate this
line<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.069> line<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.930> button

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
line and this line and then this button

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.150 
line and this line and then this button
will<00:03:25.530> activate<00:03:25.620> all<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.880> them<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.780> sort<00:03:27.959> of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
will activate all of them it's sort of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.050 
will activate all of them it's sort of
that<00:03:29.160> aspect<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.459> button<00:03:32.850> will

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
that aspect but but this button will

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.690 
that aspect but but this button will
also<00:03:33.450> only<00:03:34.079> activate<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.920> mean<00:03:35.190> will<00:03:35.310> activate

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
also only activate I mean will activate

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.879 
also only activate I mean will activate
this<00:03:37.280> second<00:03:38.280> level<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.760> well<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.299> then<00:03:40.290> this

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
this second level as well and then this

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.449 
this second level as well and then this
one<00:03:40.950> will<00:03:41.400> activate<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:43.260> bottom<00:03:43.680> level<00:03:43.889> along

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
one will activate the bottom level along

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.150 
one will activate the bottom level along
with<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.910> white<00:03:45.180> level<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.139> that's<00:03:46.889> kind<00:03:47.130> of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
with this white level so that's kind of

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.629 
with this white level so that's kind of
how<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.459> works<00:03:48.319> this<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.799> RS<00:03:50.370> nor<00:03:50.579> latch

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
how it works this is the RS nor latch

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.490 
how it works this is the RS nor latch
system<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.510> i<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.049> other<00:03:52.200> side

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
system that i have on the other side

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.090 
system that i have on the other side
it's<00:03:52.829> practically<00:03:53.400> identical<00:03:54.709> this<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
it's practically identical this is the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's practically identical this is the
set<00:03:56.579> right<00:03:57.109> here<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.880> when<00:03:59.880> we<00:04:00.180> set<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.540> this

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
set right here so when we set it this

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.610 
set right here so when we set it this
example<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.889> pressing<00:04:02.400> here

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
example is pressing here

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.539 
example is pressing here
we<00:04:02.980> set<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:04.540> wire<00:04:05.200> will<00:04:05.230> power<00:04:05.799> this

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
we set it the wire will power this

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.440 
we set it the wire will power this
piston<00:04:07.150> right<00:04:07.870> here<00:04:08.670> which<00:04:09.670> pushes<00:04:10.030> this

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
piston right here which pushes this

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
piston right here which pushes this
block<00:04:10.900> into<00:04:11.440> place<00:04:12.360> what<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.780> purple<00:04:14.110> block

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
block into place what that purple block

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.439 
block into place what that purple block
right<00:04:14.769> here<00:04:14.799> does<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:16.090> allows<00:04:16.209> a

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
right here does is it allows a

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.180 
right here does is it allows a
connection<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.949> go<00:04:18.579> from<00:04:19.470> from<00:04:20.470> from<00:04:20.889> my

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
connection to go from from from my

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.390 
connection to go from from from my
system<00:04:21.850> down<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.900> instead<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.680> continuing

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
system down and instead of continuing

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.070 
system down and instead of continuing
down<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.580> broke<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.150> broke<00:04:25.449> it<00:04:25.510> out<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
down I broke it and broke it out to the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.140 
down I broke it and broke it out to the
side<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.860> could<00:04:27.100> play<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.400> place<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.910> block

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
side so I could play this place is block

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.600 
side so I could play this place is block
here<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.199> goes<00:04:29.380> into<00:04:29.740> here<00:04:30.250> into<00:04:30.370> this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
here so it goes into here into this

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.150 
here so it goes into here into this
block<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.360> into<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.380> repeater<00:04:32.740> into

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
block and in into this repeater into

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.860 
block and in into this repeater into
this<00:04:33.280> block<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:34.150> if<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.419> block<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.690> removed

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
this block so if the block is removed

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.500 
this block so if the block is removed
you<00:04:35.830> will<00:04:35.860> only<00:04:36.100> go<00:04:36.340> down<00:04:36.520> one<00:04:36.760> floor<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.300> in

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
you will only go down one floor and in

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.450 
you will only go down one floor and in
its<00:04:37.930> default<00:04:38.530> state<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:40.000> only<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.710> floor

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
its default state it is only one floor

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.600 
its default state it is only one floor
so<00:04:43.330> what<00:04:44.169> you're<00:04:44.350> essentially<00:04:45.100> doing<00:04:45.250> when

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
so what you're essentially doing when

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.860 
so what you're essentially doing when
you're<00:04:45.699> pressing<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.120> button<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.479> overriding

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
you're pressing the button is overriding

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.230 
you're pressing the button is overriding
that<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.530> making<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:48.010> continued<00:04:48.699> to<00:04:48.729> go<00:04:49.000> as

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
that and making it continued to go as

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.570 
that and making it continued to go as
far<00:04:49.840> down<00:04:50.229> as<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.039> want<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:52.530> now<00:04:53.530> as<00:04:54.039> far<00:04:54.520> as

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
far down as you want it now as far as

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.330 
far down as you want it now as far as
the<00:04:54.850> reset<00:04:55.650> when<00:04:56.650> this<00:04:57.639> gets<00:04:57.910> powered<00:04:58.680> if<00:04:59.680> this

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
the reset when this gets powered if this

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.790 
the reset when this gets powered if this
power<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.030> same<00:05:01.210> time<00:05:01.449> this<00:05:01.690> piece<00:05:02.680> of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
power is the same time this piece of

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.690 
power is the same time this piece of
redstone<00:05:02.979> powers<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.340> so<00:05:06.550> this

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
redstone powers so and this is so this

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.270 
redstone powers so and this is so this
is<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.970> reset<00:05:07.389> so<00:05:07.660> after<00:05:08.440> this<00:05:08.620> gets<00:05:08.860> powered

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
is the reset so after this gets powered

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.839 
is the reset so after this gets powered
and<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:10.450> power<00:05:10.810> goes<00:05:11.080> into<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:12.099> torch<00:05:12.550> and

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
and this power goes into this torch and

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.589 
and this power goes into this torch and
then<00:05:13.240> continues<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.169> circuit<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.389> on<00:05:16.570> a

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
then continues the circuit this is on a

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.000 
then continues the circuit this is on a
4<00:05:17.229> tick<00:05:17.590> delay<00:05:17.950> oh<00:05:18.780> yeah<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.080> isn't<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.620> 4

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
4 tick delay oh yeah it isn't on a 4

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.710 
4 tick delay oh yeah it isn't on a 4
tick<00:05:21.220> delay<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:22.150> shut<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.510> off<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:24.150> reset<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
tick delay to shut it off I to reset the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.469 
tick delay to shut it off I to reset the
Arsenal<00:05:26.200> light<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:26.530> it'll<00:05:26.740> turn<00:05:27.010> this<00:05:27.479> line

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
Arsenal light so it'll turn this line

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.020 
Arsenal light so it'll turn this line
back<00:05:28.930> off<00:05:29.229> so<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.770> won't<00:05:29.830> they<00:05:30.400> won't<00:05:30.669> stay<00:05:31.000> on

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
back off so it won't they won't stay on

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.900 
back off so it won't they won't stay on
so<00:05:31.870> but<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.680> only<00:05:32.860> problem<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.430> like<00:05:33.610> really

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
so but the only problem of like really

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.469 
so but the only problem of like really
found<00:05:34.240> with<00:05:35.169> this<00:05:35.380> is<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.800> if<00:05:36.010> someone

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.710 

selects<00:05:40.479> this<00:05:40.930> one<00:05:41.229> it<00:05:42.180> changes<00:05:43.180> their<00:05:43.449> mind

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
selects this one it changes their mind

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.670 
selects this one it changes their mind
and<00:05:44.050> once<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.650> know<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.220> want<00:05:45.699> that<00:05:45.940> one<00:05:46.680> that's

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and once I know I want that one that's

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.029 
and once I know I want that one that's
not<00:05:47.889> going<00:05:48.010> to<00:05:48.099> work<00:05:49.349> as<00:05:50.349> you<00:05:50.530> can<00:05:50.650> see<00:05:50.860> they're

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
not going to work as you can see they're

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.320 
not going to work as you can see they're
all<00:05:51.250> still<00:05:51.849> set<00:05:52.240> so<00:05:52.960> in<00:05:53.349> order<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:54.060> fix<00:05:55.060> that

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
all still set so in order to fix that

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.140 
all still set so in order to fix that
you<00:05:55.930> just<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.470> press<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.639> reset<00:05:58.120> it

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
you just you press the you just reset it

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.060 
you just you press the you just reset it
resetting<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.750> is<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.590> button<00:05:59.889> right<00:06:00.039> there

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
resetting it is that button right there

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.010 
resetting it is that button right there
and<00:06:00.490> then<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.240> can<00:06:01.389> just<00:06:01.510> go<00:06:01.660> ahead<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:01.810> press

to<00:06:03.729> let<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:03.910> go<00:06:04.060> down<00:06:04.800> through<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.919> system<00:06:06.130> to

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
to let it go down through the system to

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.719 
to let it go down through the system to
reset<00:06:07.090> all<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:08.050> Orson<00:06:08.650> eyelashes<00:06:09.039> I<00:06:09.220> can

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
reset all the Orson eyelashes I can

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.290 
reset all the Orson eyelashes I can
probably<00:06:10.200> put<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.229> reset<00:06:11.800> in<00:06:12.010> here<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.610> reset

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
probably put a reset in here a reset

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.020 
button
but<00:06:14.470> then<00:06:14.650> that's<00:06:14.890> just<00:06:15.100> another<00:06:15.430> button<00:06:15.790> you

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
but then that's just another button you

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.480 
but then that's just another button you
have<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.360> have<00:06:16.570> rather<00:06:17.530> than<00:06:17.800> just<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.190> one<00:06:18.370> in

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
have to have rather than just the one in

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.550 
have to have rather than just the one in
the<00:06:18.580> back<00:06:18.790> it<00:06:19.600> looks<00:06:19.900> like<00:06:19.960> something's<00:06:20.320> going

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
the back it looks like something's going

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.280 
the back it looks like something's going
on<00:06:23.100> yeah<00:06:24.100> that's<00:06:24.340> kind<00:06:24.880> of<00:06:24.940> loud<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.510> should

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
on yeah that's kind of loud I should

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.920 
on yeah that's kind of loud I should
close<00:06:26.440> my<00:06:26.590> windows<00:06:27.300> just<00:06:28.300> go<00:06:28.480> fly<00:06:28.660> over<00:06:28.810> there

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
close my windows just go fly over there

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.450 
close my windows just go fly over there

helping like Superman be boxer boy no I

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.860 
helping like Superman be boxer boy no I
don't<00:06:33.760> know<00:06:33.820> um<00:06:34.890> so<00:06:35.890> yeah<00:06:36.040> it's<00:06:36.750> it's<00:06:37.750> the

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
don't know um so yeah it's it's the

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.260 
don't know um so yeah it's it's the

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
basic principle of it guys I'm pretty

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.540 
basic principle of it guys I'm pretty
sure<00:06:40.510> I<00:06:40.570> explained<00:06:41.290> it<00:06:41.440> properly<00:06:41.860> but<00:06:41.980> what

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
sure I explained it properly but what

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.880 
sure I explained it properly but what
the<00:06:42.670> hell<00:06:42.990> um<00:06:45.090> alright<00:06:46.090> guys<00:06:46.390> well<00:06:47.310> enjoy<00:06:48.720> the

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
the hell um alright guys well enjoy the

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.620 
the hell um alright guys well enjoy the
tutorial<00:06:50.890> the<00:06:51.580> next<00:06:51.820> tutorial<00:06:51.940> is<00:06:52.360> going<00:06:52.390> to

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
tutorial the next tutorial is going to

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.460 
tutorial the next tutorial is going to
be<00:06:52.750> this<00:06:52.900> section<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:54.430> up<00:06:54.750> section<00:06:55.750> up<00:06:55.960> by<00:06:56.230> one

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
be this section the up section up by one

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.500 
be this section the up section up by one
floor<00:06:56.830> then<00:06:59.130> I'm<00:07:00.130> thinking<00:07:00.910> of<00:07:01.030> adding<00:07:01.240> the

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
floor then I'm thinking of adding the

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.480 
floor then I'm thinking of adding the
down<00:07:01.750> by<00:07:01.960> 14<00:07:02.470> to<00:07:03.280> the<00:07:03.730> up<00:07:04.090> by<00:07:04.360> 14<00:07:05.040> too<00:07:06.040> because

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
down by 14 to the up by 14 too because

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.370 
down by 14 to the up by 14 too because
they<00:07:06.640> seem<00:07:06.970> to<00:07:07.000> go<00:07:07.270> hand<00:07:07.300> in<00:07:07.630> hand<00:07:07.690> and<00:07:08.200> then

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
they seem to go hand in hand and then
