00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
blender as a video editor today we're

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.120 
blender as a video editor today we're
going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.210> finally<00:00:06.690> talk<00:00:06.870> about<00:00:07.130> rendering

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
going to finally talk about rendering

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.520 
going to finally talk about rendering
now<00:00:08.670> we've<00:00:09.510> got<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.840> point<00:00:10.080> without<00:00:10.200> ever

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
now we've got to this point without ever

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.060 
now we've got to this point without ever
making<00:00:10.980> an<00:00:11.219> AVI<00:00:11.460> file<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> peg<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:12.960> file<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
making an AVI file or a peg for file so

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.530 
making an AVI file or a peg for file so
you've<00:00:14.519> probably<00:00:14.670> figured<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.420> can

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
you've probably figured out that you can

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.880 
you've probably figured out that you can
just<00:00:15.660> press<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.289> button<00:00:16.500> down<00:00:16.740> here

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
just press this little button down here

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.420 
just press this little button down here
or<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> render<00:00:18.960> section<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
or go up to the render section of the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.779 
or go up to the render section of the
menu<00:00:20.760> system<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.240> select<00:00:21.900> render<00:00:22.230> animation

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
menu system and select render animation

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.070 
menu system and select render animation
pretty<00:00:23.789> simple<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> things<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> do

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
pretty simple but the things that you do

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
pretty simple but the things that you do
need<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> get

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
need to know is what is going to get

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.529 
need to know is what is going to get
rendered<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.859> how<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.250> control<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
rendered and how can I control if the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
rendered and how can I control if the
render<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.830> screen<00:00:32.219> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
render is going to go to the screen or

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.970 
render is going to go to the screen or
it's<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> happen<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> background

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
it's going to happen in the background

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's going to happen in the background
so<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.309> guess<00:00:36.300> where<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.600> should<00:00:36.750> start<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.290> with

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so I guess where we should start is with

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
so I guess where we should start is with
these<00:00:38.360> black<00:00:39.360> lines<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
these black lines that are in the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
these black lines that are in the
sequencer<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.670> black<00:00:41.910> lines<00:00:42.180> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
sequencer these black lines this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.500 
sequencer these black lines this
starting<00:00:43.050> line<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.860> ending<00:00:44.280> line

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
starting line and this ending line

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.959 
starting line and this ending line
represent<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.170> range<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
represent the range that is going to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.959 
represent the range that is going to
actually<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.440> rendered<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.190> AVI<00:00:50.640> file

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
actually be rendered to the AVI file

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
actually be rendered to the AVI file
that<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> will<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> output<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.199> hit<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that it will be output when we hit the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
that it will be output when we hit the
render<00:00:52.739> button<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:54.059> change<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
render button now you can change that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.040 
render button now you can change that
range<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.949> simply<00:00:56.850> clicking<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.300> end<00:00:57.600> down

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
range by simply clicking on end down

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
range by simply clicking on end down
here<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.559> typing<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.550> new<00:01:00.180> range<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:02.190> can

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
here and typing in a new range you can

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.479 
here and typing in a new range you can
see<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> black<00:01:02.850> bar<00:01:03.619> was<00:01:04.619> extended<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
see that the black bar was extended to a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.000 
see that the black bar was extended to a
farther<00:01:06.450> frame<00:01:07.310> or<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
it the same way that you did down there

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.289 
it the same way that you did down there
very<00:01:29.909> easy<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.180> actually

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
very easy to do so I do want to actually

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
very easy to do so I do want to actually
set<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> last<00:01:35.040> frame

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
set this to go right to the last frame

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
set this to go right to the last frame
so<00:01:36.450> let's<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.130> frame<00:01:38.780> 172<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.020> I'll

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so let's that's at frame 172 so I'll

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
so let's that's at frame 172 so I'll
actually<00:01:40.229> type<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> 172<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:43.070> hit<00:01:44.070> enter<00:01:44.340> and

to<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.329> section<00:02:03.600> let's<00:02:04.110> try<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.439> out

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to this section let's try that out

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.169 
to this section let's try that out
let's<00:02:05.250> hit<00:02:05.399> animation<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
let's hit animation and you can see the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.080 
let's hit animation and you can see the
video<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.810> being<00:02:09.840> rendered<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.760> image

we'll<00:02:15.150> give<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.450> second<00:02:15.840> there<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.110> go

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
we'll give that a second there we go

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690 
we'll give that a second there we go
that's<00:02:16.410> finished<00:02:16.710> now<00:02:16.950> I'm<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> switch

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that's finished now I'm going to switch

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
that's finished now I'm going to switch
that<00:02:17.850> back<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.390> down<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.870> video

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that back by going down here and video

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
that back by going down here and video
sequencer<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:20.880> very<00:02:21.030> convenient<00:02:21.390> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
sequencer it's not very convenient to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.820 
sequencer it's not very convenient to
have<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.080> go<00:02:22.170> down<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.770> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
have that go down there then I have to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
have that go down there then I have to
switch<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.130> back<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:23.970> don't<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
switch it back I really don't like that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.350 
switch it back I really don't like that
another<00:02:25.380> option<00:02:25.500> would<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> render<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.210> in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
another option would be to render it in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.390 
another option would be to render it in
a<00:02:27.570> new<00:02:27.720> window<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.320> we'll<00:02:29.040> select<00:02:29.130> new<00:02:29.370> window

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
a new window so we'll select new window

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.630 
a new window so we'll select new window
and<00:02:29.940> animate<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.980> open<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.310> brand<00:02:32.520> new

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and animate and it open up a brand new

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
and animate and it open up a brand new
window<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:35.010> doing<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> animation<00:02:37.190> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
window and it's doing the animation and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.920 
window and it's doing the animation and
we'll<00:02:38.340> let<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.460> finish<00:02:38.730> there<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.240> close

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
we'll let that finish there we go close

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.170 
we'll let that finish there we go close
that<00:02:40.110> down<00:02:40.550> every<00:02:41.550> time<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.880> hit<00:02:42.000> this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that down every time that I hit this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330 
that down every time that I hit this
render<00:02:42.570> or<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.380> animation<00:02:43.710> button<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
render or this animation button in the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190 
render or this animation button in the
render<00:02:44.670> section<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.480> actually<00:02:45.810> animating

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
render section it is actually animating

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280 
render section it is actually animating
it<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.940> putting<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.090> into<00:02:48.270> an<00:02:48.450> AVI<00:02:48.690> file<00:02:49.020> in

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it and putting that into an AVI file in

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
it and putting that into an AVI file in
my<00:02:49.530> output<00:02:49.800> directory<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.580> also<00:02:53.730> do

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
my output directory so you can also do

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.290 
my output directory so you can also do
fullscreen<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:55.850> will<00:02:56.850> actually<00:02:57.270> render<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
fullscreen I will actually render that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.490 
fullscreen I will actually render that
kind<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.360> similar<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.780> doing<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.050> new<00:03:01.170> window

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
kind of similar to doing a new window

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.690 
kind of similar to doing a new window
just<00:03:01.980> expands<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> all<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> way<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:07.700> guys

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
just expands it all the way out you guys

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.490 
just expands it all the way out you guys
hit<00:03:08.970> go<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> previous<00:03:09.810> window<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.350> get

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
hit go to the previous window to get

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.370 
hit go to the previous window to get
back<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:10.860> now<00:03:12.080> here's<00:03:13.080> what<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.290> would

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
back here now here's what I would

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
back here now here's what I would
recommend<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> use<00:03:14.370> which<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.820> keep<00:03:15.210> UI

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
recommend that you use which is keep UI

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.230 
recommend that you use which is keep UI
if<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.500> use<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.670> option

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
if you use this option

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.940 
if you use this option
it<00:03:18.450> doesn't<00:03:19.140> actually<00:03:19.380> render<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it doesn't actually render it to the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.740 
it doesn't actually render it to the
screen<00:03:20.160> at<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:20.400> which<00:03:20.760> means<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.180> you're

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
screen at all which means that you're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.130 
screen at all which means that you're
not<00:03:21.900> wasting<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:23.120> processor<00:03:24.120> power<00:03:24.330> rendering

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
not wasting a processor power rendering

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
not wasting a processor power rendering
an<00:03:25.320> image<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> screen<00:03:26.150> while<00:03:27.150> you're

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
an image to the screen while you're

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.660 
an image to the screen while you're
trying<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.110> process<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.560> into<00:03:28.830> an<00:03:28.920> AVI<00:03:29.130> file<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
trying to process it into an AVI file I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.640 
trying to process it into an AVI file I
would<00:03:30.150> recommend<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.780> actually<00:03:31.020> turn

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
would recommend that you actually turn

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.630 
would recommend that you actually turn
it<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.890> keep<00:03:32.070> UI

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
it to keep UI

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.430 
it to keep UI
so<00:03:32.880> let's<00:03:33.030> actually<00:03:33.150> render<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.930> let's

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
so let's actually render that and let's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.710 
so let's actually render that and let's
keep<00:03:34.590> our<00:03:34.740> eyes<00:03:34.950> open<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.330> top<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
keep our eyes open up to the top of the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.280 
keep our eyes open up to the top of the
screen<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.410> what<00:03:37.560> happens<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:40.050> can<00:03:40.170> see

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
screen to see what happens you can see

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.410 
screen to see what happens you can see
right<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:41.460> sequencing<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> render

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
right here it's sequencing the render

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.730 
right here it's sequencing the render
it's<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:43.530> showing<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> on<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.280> screen<00:03:45.740> that

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
it's not showing it on the screen that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.170 
it's not showing it on the screen that
would<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> best<00:03:47.250> option<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.880> lower

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
would be the best option on lower

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.740 
would be the best option on lower
powered<00:03:48.540> systems<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.400> guess<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.450> pretty

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
powered systems so I guess that pretty

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.340 
powered systems so I guess that pretty
much<00:03:51.870> sums<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.890> rendering<00:03:53.340> process<00:03:54.170> on<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
much sums up the rendering process on to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.800 
much sums up the rendering process on to
the<00:03:55.410> next<00:03:55.590> video
