computer's IP address by going into
system<00:02:21.250> preferences<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.370> head

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
system preferences so now just be head

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.199

should<00:02:28.660> be<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:29.050> here<00:02:29.220> now<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.690> learned<00:02:31.690> it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
should be right here now I learned it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.940 
should be right here now I learned it
out<00:02:31.930> because<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.260> don't<00:02:32.380> want<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:32.709> my<00:02:32.800> IP

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
out because I don't want to see my IP

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.339 
out because I don't want to see my IP
address<00:02:33.069> but<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.120> okay<00:02:34.510> so

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
address but you know there it is okay so

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.170 
address but you know there it is okay so
once<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:35.890> information<00:02:36.180> you're

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
once you get that information you're

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.570 
once you get that information you're
going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.390> put<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.630> right<00:02:38.050> here<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.220> let's<00:02:39.459> edit

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
going to put it right here so let's edit

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
going to put it right here so let's edit
this<00:02:39.790> part<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> actually<00:02:46.330> I'm<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.510> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
this part so actually I'm going to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960 
this part so actually I'm going to
change<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> port<00:02:47.110> number<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.430> don't<00:02:48.730> have

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
change the port number if you don't have

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.050 
change the port number if you don't have
if<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.700> starting<00:02:51.700> point<00:02:51.970> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
if you don't have the starting point and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.699 
if you don't have the starting point and
an<00:02:52.180> ending<00:02:52.269> point<00:02:52.510> put<00:02:53.080> them<00:02:53.200> exactly<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
an ending point put them exactly the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.530 
an ending point put them exactly the
same<00:02:53.920> most<00:02:54.760> routers<00:02:54.940> will<00:02:55.180> ask<00:02:55.330> for<00:02:55.510> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
same most routers will ask for a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.850 
same most routers will ask for a
starting<00:02:55.780> point<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.110> an<00:02:56.230> ending<00:02:56.290> point<00:02:56.500> which

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
starting point and an ending point which

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.979 
starting point and an ending point which
is<00:02:56.890> fine<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.400> don't<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.640> one<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.870> there

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
is fine if you don't have one so there

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.449 
is fine if you don't have one so there
that's<00:02:59.200> my<00:02:59.410> that's<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.400> be

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that's my that's what it's going to be

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.680 
that's my that's what it's going to be
forward<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.910> at<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.090> needs<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.540> for

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
forward to do at this needs to be I for

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.780 
forward to do at this needs to be I for
us<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.049> computer<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:03.160> make<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> name<00:03:03.580> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
us to the computer I just make a name it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
us to the computer I just make a name it
should<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.000> TCP<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.780> UDP<00:03:05.290> depending<00:03:06.069> on<00:03:06.190> what

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
should be TCP and UDP depending on what

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.220 
should be TCP and UDP depending on what
game<00:03:07.000> you're<00:03:07.120> playing<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.630> playing<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:08.049> game

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
game you're playing I'm playing a game

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.020 
game you're playing I'm playing a game
called<00:03:08.260> sauerbraten<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.549> what<00:03:09.670> I'm<00:03:09.730> 40

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
called sauerbraten so that's what I'm 40

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.589 
called sauerbraten so that's what I'm 40
now<00:03:11.849> sauerbraten<00:03:12.849> requires<00:03:13.180> me<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.360> forward

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
now sauerbraten requires me to forward

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:28.970 
now sauerbraten requires me to forward
two<00:03:13.840> ports<00:03:14.489> oh<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:19.150> going<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.359> do<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.540> now

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.770 

they've<00:03:29.980> done<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.400> there's<00:03:31.269> no<00:03:31.480> Save<00:03:31.750> button

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
they've done this there's no Save button

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.539 
they've done this there's no Save button
which<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.440> kind<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.829> funny<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.340> doesn't

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
which is kind of funny and it doesn't

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.460 
which is kind of funny and it doesn't
have<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.760> restart<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.090> router<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.540> add<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.930> so

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
have to restart the router to add it so

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.289 
have to restart the router to add it so
you're<00:03:35.650> done<00:03:35.829> forwarding<00:03:36.160> your<00:03:36.220> ports<00:03:36.549> now

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
you're done forwarding your ports now

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.449 
you're done forwarding your ports now
you<00:03:37.989> go<00:03:38.200> into<00:03:38.410> your<00:03:38.500> game<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.980> see<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
you go into your game and see if the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.280 
you go into your game and see if the
