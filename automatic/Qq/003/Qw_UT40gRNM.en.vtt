liking the firebrands rough coving it

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.120 
liking the firebrands rough coving it
wraps<00:01:17.270> around<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.140> siding<00:01:18.500> sets<00:01:18.770> on<00:01:18.920> top

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
wraps around so the siding sets on top

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.920 
wraps around so the siding sets on top
of<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.000> sits<00:01:20.299> on<00:01:20.450> top<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.720> the
