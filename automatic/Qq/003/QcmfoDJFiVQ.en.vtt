00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
this side I don't know why but I thought

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.429 
this side I don't know why but I thought
the<00:01:23.070> rums<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.700> destroy<00:01:24.090> two<00:01:24.420> layers<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.259> water

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the rums can destroy two layers of water

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
the rums can destroy two layers of water
and<00:01:25.860> yes<00:01:26.070> they<00:01:26.729> did<00:01:26.790> destroy<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> side<00:01:27.869> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and yes they did destroy on this side so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
and yes they did destroy on this side so
I<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.790> happens<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> right

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I don't know what happens on the right

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
I don't know what happens on the right
side<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:32.430> didn't<00:01:32.729> work<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.710> I'm<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.890> to
