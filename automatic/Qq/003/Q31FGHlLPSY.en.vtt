00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 friends of the nightmare of the tipsters 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.120
 welcome to the quarterfinals of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.620
 this world cup 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.859
 so good you noticed it for this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 which is eighth happily this 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.130
 is not for that one prognostic and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 the scenarios that was a little bit hard 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
 to find more than the winners to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.369
 arrival that is to say that all 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.920
 favorites are gone and we can say that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.289
 almost all the favorites have 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 enormously suffered 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.829
 which gives us the arrival of the quarters 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 final very difficult to decipher 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.879
 so these quarterfinals are going 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 start Friday at 18h by obviously 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 the match on 29 plus this famous France 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.550
 germany didier deschamps does not want 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 not hear about the historical side 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.469
 which does not seem its explanation either 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 the players were not not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 totally inept were not born 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.840
 beware the second world war 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 World then we hear about anyway 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 not good it's a point of detail the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.480
 la France 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.320
 we were very good and rather lucky 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.760
 against nigeria germany did a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 catastrophic first half against 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.600
 Algeria before badly missing 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.610
 of efficiency in front of goal the Germans 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.290
 aside from the opening match of their 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.229
 hen against the Portuguese or 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.710
 Portuguese are suicidal they do not make a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.060
 super impression I hope a lot to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 nancy but I would be a little late 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.720
 propose here I hope very much that the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 will give back to the middle that will be 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 a lot less annoying for the team 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.790
 France that if he puts back right 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 after it's a team a little bit 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.780
 complicated scored since am I 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 plays without fore-center almost 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.330
 midfielders because it's a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.320
 match where he will have to be very patient and 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.940
 to tell you everything I see it go to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 shots on goal and it will be a lot of goals 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 during the match I think for us 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.680
 here it's a draw after a series of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.950
 shots on goal it's more of the prognosis 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.780
 the acea crystal ball the evening we have 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 right to a brazil colombia that's all 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.209
 as tight then Brazilians are 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.500
 came out more than miraculously when the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.350
 chile with more debauchery not even 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.370
 of energy but a debauch of emotion 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.220
 which still leaves me extremely 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.570
 perplexed 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.519
 the image of a thiago silva who passes his 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.380
 world cup to whine if on the go 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.170
 during the anthem i shall when he wins 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.760
 at alfa and that we saw even kleenex 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 as sponsor 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.040
 private about what we saw I think 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.900
 for the round of 16 the team 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.670
 which has imposed itself without the slightest 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.950
 contests with the easiest it is 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.540
 Colombia against the web and we are 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.400
 parameters clears that we know well in 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.650
 France making a world cup 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.200
 exceptional after that we come to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.810
 quarterfinals in brazil against the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.510
 brazil with even more pressure 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.599
 popular that may be infernal and 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.180
 it's impossible to know how this 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.920
 Columbia team will play in this 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.269
 context on the ground I think she 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.430
 everything all to worry even 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.780
 eliminated brazil but then there if we 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.150
 is in the field of thy pure sounds 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.840
 I think Brazil will win 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 hard but it promises
