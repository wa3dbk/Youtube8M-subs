00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
as tall as the box and it's a bit taller

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.060 
as tall as the box and it's a bit taller
than<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.739> close

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
than that it's going to be a very close

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
than that it's going to be a very close
fit<00:00:53.640> alright<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.719> after<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:55.260> careful

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
fit alright so after some careful

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
fit alright so after some careful
measurements<00:00:57.620> consideration<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> going

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
measurements consideration this is going

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
measurements consideration this is going
to<00:00:59.460> work<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.719> close

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to work what it is going to be close

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.080 
to work what it is going to be close
this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:04.339> when<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:05.939> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this is a when I have it in there like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
this is a when I have it in there like
that<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.840> dealing<00:01:07.080> with

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that I'm dealing with

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
that I'm dealing with
oh<00:01:09.890> just<00:01:10.890> over<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.310> inch<00:01:11.369> clearance<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.270> I'm

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
oh just over an inch clearance so I'm

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
oh just over an inch clearance so I'm
gonna<00:01:12.450> lose<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
gonna lose some of that when I have it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.270 
gonna lose some of that when I have it
sitting<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> sump<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.890> boy<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> thing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
sitting in the sump so boy if this thing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.800 
sitting in the sump so boy if this thing
we're<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.490> inch<00:01:17.640> taller<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.090> wouldn't<00:01:18.360> work<00:01:18.509> as

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we're an inch taller it wouldn't work as

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.700 
we're an inch taller it wouldn't work as
a<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.890> gonna<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.100> pretty<00:01:20.159> cool

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
later um the new skimmer is installed

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
later um the new skimmer is installed
actually<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.640> closer<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> 45<00:01:54.329> minutes<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:55.680> just

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
actually is closer to 45 minutes it just

actually is closer to 45 minutes it just
barely<00:01:56.399> fit<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.229> difficult<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
barely fit it was difficult to get in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.350 
barely fit it was difficult to get in
place<00:01:59.280> if<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.420> were<00:02:00.600> maybe<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.290> half<00:02:01.530> inch

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
place if this were maybe a half inch

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
place if this were maybe a half inch
more<00:02:03.360> anti<00:02:03.570> ammeter<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> don't<00:02:04.140> think<00:02:04.320> I'm

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
more anti ammeter I don't think I'm

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
more anti ammeter I don't think I'm
gonna<00:02:04.469> fit<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.189> were<00:02:05.280> an<00:02:05.399> inch<00:02:05.520> taller<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
gonna fit if it were an inch taller it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.150 
gonna fit if it were an inch taller it
certainly<00:02:06.270> wouldn't<00:02:06.600> fit

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
certainly wouldn't fit

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.340 
certainly wouldn't fit
one<00:02:08.910> thing<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.270> nice<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> hang<00:02:10.170> on

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
one thing that's nice as it is a hang on

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.590 
one thing that's nice as it is a hang on
tank<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:10.890> when<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.520> my<00:02:11.550> refugium<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.390> think

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
tank so when I do my refugium I think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.110 
tank so when I do my refugium I think
that<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.930> should<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.200> able<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:14.030> set<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
that you should be able to set it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
that you should be able to set it
outside<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.510> refugium<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.350> maybe<00:02:16.620> make

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
outside that refugium and maybe make

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.510 
outside that refugium and maybe make
some<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.070> room<00:02:17.130> inside<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> far

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
some more room inside for that so far

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.800 
some more room inside for that so far
everything<00:02:20.880> seems<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.270> going<00:02:21.390> well<00:02:21.510> you
