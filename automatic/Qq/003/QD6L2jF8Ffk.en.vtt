00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you can see the battery tray goes almost

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can see the battery tray goes almost
to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> bottom<00:01:42.660> but<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.170> quite<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.340> either

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to the bottom but not quite so either

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.610 
to the bottom but not quite so either
I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> space<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
I'm going to need to space it off of the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.650 
I'm going to need to space it off of the
Jeep<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.980> little<00:01:47.190> bit<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.550> cut<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.120> part<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
Jeep a little bit or cut this part of

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.840 
Jeep a little bit or cut this part of
the<00:01:48.720> corner<00:01:49.050> out<00:01:49.230> so<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.280> sit<00:01:50.550> flat

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the corner out so that it can sit flat

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
the corner out so that it can sit flat
it<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.180> has<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.720> another<00:01:52.050> half<00:01:52.260> inch

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it just has to go down another half inch

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
it just has to go down another half inch
or<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.360> ahead<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.870> battery

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
or so but go ahead and put your battery

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.280 
or so but go ahead and put your battery
in<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.720> fits<00:01:58.140> nice<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.440> there

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
in there there we go fits nice in there

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.750 
in there there we go fits nice in there
as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.980> goes<00:02:02.160> right<00:02:02.280> underneath

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
as you can see it goes right underneath

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.580 
as you can see it goes right underneath
the<00:02:03.750> radiator<00:02:03.990> cap<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:06.050> this<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.230> just<00:02:07.440> the

the radiator cap here this is just the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.220 
the radiator cap here this is just the
stock<00:02:07.890> battery<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> Cherokee<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.990> got

be the same battery that I've got on the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.210 
be the same battery that I've got on the
other<00:02:14.370> side<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.710> all<00:02:16.710> right<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.130> I'm

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
other side as well all right so what I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.250 
other side as well all right so what I'm
going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.550> now<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.030> take<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> marker<00:02:19.110> in

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
going to do now is just take a marker in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.760 
going to do now is just take a marker in
and<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.750> mark<00:02:21.750> right<00:02:22.020> there<00:02:22.050> I'm<00:02:22.380> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> take

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and a mark right there I'm going to take

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.320 
and a mark right there I'm going to take
part<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.340> corner<00:02:23.730> off<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> battery

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
part of that corner off of the battery

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
part of that corner off of the battery
tray<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.960> it'll<00:02:25.140> sit<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.890> further

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
tray so it'll sit down a little further

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.080 
tray so it'll sit down a little further
and<00:02:26.570> sit<00:02:27.570> flat<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.170> bottom<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:29.090> another

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and sit flat on the bottom here another

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.790 
and sit flat on the bottom here another
option<00:02:30.510> would<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.900> take<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> big<00:02:31.380> hammer<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
option would be to take a big hammer and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
option would be to take a big hammer and
just<00:02:32.070> pound<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.670> sheet<00:02:32.910> metal<00:02:32.940> right

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
just pound out in the sheet metal right

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.590 
just pound out in the sheet metal right
there<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.010> I'm<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.870> do<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.110> way

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.850 

alright<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> went<00:02:43.020> ahead<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.350> tested<00:02:43.530> it

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
alright so I went ahead and tested it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.199 
alright so I went ahead and tested it
again<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> looks<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.520> there's<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:44.880> more

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
again it looks like there's one more

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.030 
again it looks like there's one more
area<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:45.840> hitting<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.380> somewhere<00:02:46.739> right

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
area that's hitting it's somewhere right

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.440 
area that's hitting it's somewhere right
around<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.700> I'm<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> take<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> piece

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
around here so I'm going to take a piece

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.440 
around here so I'm going to take a piece
of<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:49.800> off<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.190> well

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.589 

look<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.349> now

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
look at that now

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.940 
look at that now
all<00:02:59.599> right<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.409> honest<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
all right so to be honest the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.770 
all right so to be honest the
clearancing<00:03:01.549> helped<00:03:01.849> a<00:03:01.909> little<00:03:02.060> bit<00:03:02.299> but<00:03:02.359> not

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
clearancing helped a little bit but not

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.690 
clearancing helped a little bit but not
a<00:03:03.140> whole<00:03:03.650> lot<00:03:03.920> if<00:03:04.069> I<00:03:04.159> was<00:03:04.280> going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> do<00:03:04.609> it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
a whole lot if I was going to do it

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.720 
a whole lot if I was going to do it
again<00:03:04.819> I'd<00:03:05.090> probably<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:05.569> do<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.900> spacers

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
again I'd probably just do the spacers

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.240 
again I'd probably just do the spacers
for<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:08.140> I'm<00:03:09.140> going<00:03:09.439> to<00:03:09.469> use<00:03:09.530> some<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.040> these

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
for that I'm going to use some of these

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.699 
for that I'm going to use some of these
nuts<00:03:10.640> or<00:03:11.359> if<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.629> have<00:03:11.780> some<00:03:11.989> thick<00:03:12.200> washers

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
nuts or if you have some thick washers

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.459 
nuts or if you have some thick washers
you<00:03:12.859> could<00:03:13.010> use<00:03:13.189> that<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.549> well<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.629> as<00:03:14.900> you

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
you could use that as well but as you

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.179 
you could use that as well but as you
can<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:17.500> hole<00:03:18.500> right<00:03:18.709> there<00:03:18.769> actually

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
can see that hole right there actually

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.179 
can see that hole right there actually
lines<00:03:19.639> up<00:03:19.879> with<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.810> where<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> intake<00:03:21.560> used

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
lines up with with where the intake used

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.839 
lines up with with where the intake used
to<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.040> think<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.609> was<00:03:25.819> the

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
to be and for that I think this was the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.229 
to be and for that I think this was the
nut<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.209> went<00:03:26.629> on<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.549> intake<00:03:28.549> I'm<00:03:28.819> not<00:03:29.000> sure

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
nut that went on the intake I'm not sure

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.550 
nut that went on the intake I'm not sure
but<00:03:29.569> I'm<00:03:30.349> just<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.829> put<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.939> in<00:03:32.120> there

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
but I'm just going to put that in there

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.960 
but I'm just going to put that in there
make<00:03:33.560> sure<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:33.919> in<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.189> right<00:03:34.340> spot<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
make sure it's in the right spot and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.879 
make sure it's in the right spot and
then<00:03:35.120> I'm<00:03:35.209> going<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.389> drill<00:03:35.769> another<00:03:36.769> hole

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
then I'm going to drill another hole

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.399 
then I'm going to drill another hole
right<00:03:37.310> here<00:03:40.419> all<00:03:41.419> right<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:41.720> take<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.169> out

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
right here all right now take this out

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.289 
right here all right now take this out
and<00:03:42.590> open<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.099> hole<00:03:43.250> up<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.609> little<00:03:43.790> bit<00:03:46.299> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
and open that hole up a little bit the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.809 
and open that hole up a little bit the
bolts<00:03:47.629> that<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.870> bought<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.230> use<00:03:48.409> are<00:03:48.650> 5/16<00:03:49.519> so

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
bolts that I bought to use are 5/16 so

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:58.890 
bolts that I bought to use are 5/16 so
I'm<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.930> drill<00:03:51.139> it<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:52.069> match

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.539 

all<00:03:59.900> right<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.290> make<00:04:00.469> things<00:04:00.709> easier<00:04:01.189> on<00:04:01.370> me

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
all right so to make things easier on me

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.180 
all right so to make things easier on me
I<00:04:01.579> went<00:04:01.790> ahead<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.650> pre-installed<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.799> bolts

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
I went ahead and pre-installed the bolts

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.589 
I went ahead and pre-installed the bolts
and<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> washers<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.239> on<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.019> side<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:07.599> put

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
and the washers and on this side I put

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.479 
and the washers and on this side I put
some<00:04:08.810> washers<00:04:09.229> and<00:04:09.440> some<00:04:09.620> bolts<00:04:09.919> on<00:04:10.069> there<00:04:10.280> too

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
some washers and some bolts on there too

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.089 
some washers and some bolts on there too
just<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:11.060> act<00:04:11.299> as<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.690> spacers<00:04:12.169> because<00:04:12.949> it

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
just to act as the spacers because it

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.759 
just to act as the spacers because it
was<00:04:13.220> kind<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.519> hard<00:04:13.729> to<00:04:13.930> put<00:04:14.930> those<00:04:15.079> spacers<00:04:15.590> in

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
was kind of hard to put those spacers in

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.349 
was kind of hard to put those spacers in
there<00:04:15.949> without<00:04:16.070> them<00:04:16.400> being<00:04:16.579> attached<00:04:16.940> so

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
there without them being attached so

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:28.200 
there without them being attached so
anyway<00:04:19.120> now<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.150> can<00:04:20.389> push<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.780> down<00:04:21.049> in<00:04:21.229> here

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.290 

alright<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.050> did<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.590> what's<00:04:30.949> there

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
alright now that I did that what's there

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.700 
alright now that I did that what's there
now<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.509> did<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.900> with<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.199> spacers

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
now that I did that with the spacers

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.029 
now that I did that with the spacers
that<00:04:34.419> original<00:04:35.419> bolt<00:04:35.630> isn't<00:04:36.110> long<00:04:36.440> enough<00:04:36.470> so

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
that original bolt isn't long enough so

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.230 
that original bolt isn't long enough so

that<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.810> got<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.170> all<00:05:42.320> bolted<00:05:42.740> back<00:05:42.890> in<00:05:43.160> we

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
that I got that all bolted back in we

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.630 
that I got that all bolted back in we
can<00:05:44.270> put<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.540> battery<00:05:44.870> in<00:05:45.080> again<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:49.520> when

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
can put the battery in again and when

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.770 
can put the battery in again and when
you<00:05:49.700> put<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:49.940> battery<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:50.570> probably

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
you put the battery and you probably

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.780 
you put the battery and you probably
want<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.260> put<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.860> positive<00:05:52.100> on<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:52.730> side

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
want to put the positive on this side

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.630 
want to put the positive on this side
because<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.810> just<00:05:53.990> think<00:05:54.230> it's<00:05:54.410> more<00:05:55.190> highly

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
because I just think it's more highly

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.490 
because I just think it's more highly
likely<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:56.030> you're<00:05:56.330> going<00:05:56.360> to<00:05:56.510> touch<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.350> to

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
likely that you're going to touch it to

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.380 
likely that you're going to touch it to
something<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:58.310> ground<00:05:58.610> over<00:05:59.000> here<00:05:59.030> on<00:05:59.240> this

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
something to ground over here on this

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.450 
something to ground over here on this
side<00:05:59.450> so<00:05:59.870> I'm<00:05:59.960> going<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.140> stick<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.530> positive

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
side so I'm going to stick the positive

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.920 
side so I'm going to stick the positive
over<00:06:01.730> here<00:06:01.970> out<00:06:02.120> in<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.240> middle<00:06:02.510> of<00:06:02.540> nowhere

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
over here out in the middle of nowhere

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.290 
over here out in the middle of nowhere
and<00:06:03.560> now<00:06:04.040> I<00:06:04.100> need<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.340> tighten<00:06:04.580> it<00:06:04.820> down<00:06:04.850> I

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
and now I need to tighten it down I

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.080 
and now I need to tighten it down I
don't<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.200> the<00:06:06.440> stock<00:06:06.920> strap<00:06:07.820> that<00:06:08.030> goes
