00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.860 
Undertaker that's what the stage looked
like<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:56.280> went<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> made<00:00:56.789> Raw<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
like and I just went and made Raw out of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.399 
like and I just went and made Raw out of
pure<00:00:58.739> raw<00:00:58.980> Legos<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.449> raw<00:01:00.629> right

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.649 

as<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> match<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.450> on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
as you can see you got a match going on

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
as you can see you got a match going on
here<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> looks<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.290> Hollywood<00:01:07.950> Hulk<00:01:08.159> Hogan

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
here it looks like Hollywood Hulk Hogan

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
here it looks like Hollywood Hulk Hogan
and<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:10.500> figurine<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.580> looks<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.939> Brock

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and a figurine that looks like Brock

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
and a figurine that looks like Brock
Lesnar<00:01:13.159> which<00:01:14.159> will<00:01:14.460> probably<00:01:14.820> never<00:01:14.939> see

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
Lesnar which will probably never see

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.800 
Lesnar which will probably never see
that<00:01:15.299> match<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.560> no<00:01:17.040> longer<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.810> in

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that match because they no longer are in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.109 
that match because they no longer are in
the<00:01:18.930> wabe

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
the wabe

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.179 
the wabe
anyway<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> arena<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:24.030> sweet<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.189> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
anyway this arena is pretty sweet and I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
anyway this arena is pretty sweet and I
ended<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.549> leaving<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.240> hold<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> stage

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ended up leaving I hold in the stage

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
ended up leaving I hold in the stage
right<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.189> where<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> titantron<00:01:29.820> should

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
right there where the titantron should

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
right there where the titantron should
be<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.650> ended<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.950> putting<00:01:32.189> my

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
be because I ended up putting my

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.640 
be because I ended up putting my
computer<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.600> shrinking<00:01:34.439> down

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
computer to it and then shrinking down

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.960 
computer to it and then shrinking down
the<00:01:35.040> video<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.820> computer<00:01:36.450> screen<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the video on my computer screen and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
the video on my computer screen and
making<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> fit<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.689> screen<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> can

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
making it fit the screen so you can

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.819 
making it fit the screen so you can
actually<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> live<00:01:42.049> titantron<00:01:43.049> video

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
actually have a live titantron video

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually have a live titantron video
running<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.020> arena<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
running right there in the arena so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.310 
running right there in the arena so
that's<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.130> cool<00:01:47.369> feature<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.320> I'll

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that's pretty cool feature and I'll

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
that's pretty cool feature and I'll
probably<00:01:49.530> make<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> video<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> feature

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
probably make a video with that feature

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.410 
probably make a video with that feature
sooner<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.750> later<00:01:52.430> anyway<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
sooner or later anyway you can see it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
sooner or later anyway you can see it's
a<00:01:54.479> packed<00:01:54.750> crowd<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.890> enough<00:01:56.219> lego
