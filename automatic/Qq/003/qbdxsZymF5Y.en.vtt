00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.949
 good has been a hard final match 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.020
 important because we played against another 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.410
 Argentine team so we enjoyed it 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.410
 very much 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.800
 I think the boys arrived tired 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 it favored us 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.030
 is that they played the semifinal 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.570
 after they were tired and good and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.720
 we always play the same 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 we each kept his role this never 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.579
 change if you see if you saw the 8 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.730
 matches we always play the same 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.640
 way with the same intensity trying 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.420
 to take care of my legs but with my role as 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 stand-in 3 24 minutes what is what 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.509
 lack this and the consistency and do 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.550
 always the same thing I think it was what we 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.380
 favored the final for it was a bit 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.450
 easier to put a question that we 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.220
 we knew a lot and good 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.979
 We were very attentive especially in 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.400
 defend enzo ruiz the best player in 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.890
 they 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.890
 there we had to be in the final 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.440
 I was a little calmer and not but 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.840
 it was a very hard team was one of 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.090
 the best together with us so 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.270
 we are very happy to have 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.130
 faced the final was very hard because 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.960
 we knew we had a good a good 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.750
 team in front and good what 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 we tried to do was try to penetrate 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 a lot for to gather from the defenses and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.350
 can download to find what 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.120
 that has helped us in this tournament and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.010
 winning that is the launching the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.330
 launch of external positions as well 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.970
 I think the shots were very accurate 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.220
 from outside and we have worked very well 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.390
 the defense and not allowing rebounds to 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.390
 them that they took many bounces 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.960
 thanks thanks
