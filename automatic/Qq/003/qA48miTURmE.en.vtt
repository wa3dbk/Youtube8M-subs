 Yes, he writes his story with 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.770
 work and result proven earnings 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.320
 in the growth of the breed in Brazil and that 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.900
 return to the market in the third auction without 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.670
 decency of the Ox Channel Race shows 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.670
 this May 9 during the expozebu 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.470
 the expansion of the sind is not just because 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 evident evidence of this size of the 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.540
 muscles or udder full of these 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 dairy heifers this case of double 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.740
 natural aptitude has shown numbers that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 bring more and more interested people 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.510
 in earning money from livestock 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.600
 was proven on the field day performed 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.450
 in new horizon by the diffuser family 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.750
 of this zebu species that stayed away from 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.940
 media for over 20 years and now has 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 impressed even the most 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840
 renowned technicians but the important thing is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.009
 that in the meantime the creators 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.509
 keep working and working 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.509
 Very well. 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.119
 so much so that when it was decided to 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.810
 race she is there showing results 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.270
 are concrete and they are little 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.420
 birds are audited by third parties 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 entities abc participates with a program 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 improvement is then really the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 sind resurfaced and this was shown 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.220
 cumulative improvement consultant 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 fernando m costa showed numbers of the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 the last five technical slaugh- 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.700
 have occurred since 2006 in refrigerators 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.340
 until arriving in February of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.010
 2013 with animals under 24 months 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.470
 leaving the farm with an average of 550 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.640
 kg in weight and yield 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.440
 carcass that never dropped from 58% with peak 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 more than fifty-nine percent 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.650
 well above the average for zebu in the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.390
 up to 54% 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.479
 this is what remunerates because the industry 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.459
 have more meat per animal to sell 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.830
 is what attracted so many important people 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.100
 for the trustee like this famous 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.380
 cattle rancher living on farm in August 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.470
 he visited a property in jataí 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.650
 goiás and found the syndic eating 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.959
 almost nothing and converting everything I was a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.840
 passion at first sight I went crazy 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.070
 times there were two-year days this year 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 papary, all body very good to 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.200
 time of year and conditions are being 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.370
 servants and from here to here where my 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.330
 Today I have 97 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.400
 fines acquire four basic herds and 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.870
 Now I'm going to start multiplying 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 Indians 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.030
 I like the question has no business 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.360
 other source of income do not know farm of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.340
 and I can not play has to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.730
 to raise cattle that pay my bills 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.670
 understand then trying to make a business 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.079
 productive're already well differentiated from 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.510
 Most watches do not always and have seen each other 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.569
 I told you that, I 'm going to go head-on 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.359
 Once farm is ready 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.030
 I'm very enthusiastic about the Indians 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.549
 they believe too the evolution of their race 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.190
 so other influential names also 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.359
 started to invest in the sind and adir 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.000
 carmo leonel does not need some 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.010
 presentations but last year 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.859
 noted the race's auction in 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.540
 expozebu together with the mark together with 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.730
 all your experience by investing a lot 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.569
 and a gene for enhancing 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.849
 produce animals that can multiply 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.440
 this potential all your money and is not 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.630
 because the staff is cool is not because the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.260
 race of the final result would only come 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.109
 No doubt I visited the farm sees the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.900
 cattle procedure I already knew the 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.629
 times I've come here for 56 years and 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.910
 I saw that I was going to buy the ox and improver 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.609
 the current one of 15 thousand goias who at the moment 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.620
 the ox is written uberaba auction 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.900
 I said then we are going Jorge and us 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.000
 arnaldo and we bought the ox is in the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.459
 today because it gave us a result 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.349
 fabulous then we invested in 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.949
 animal that will work and that gives 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.320
 result believed in the race to get us 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.110
 more chances if it guides him I seek 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.180
 doing too much in the north of the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.910
 customer then we have to believe 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.910
 I believe in the race and we go deep 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.979
 and I think you have already 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.120
 observed that this breed has a potential 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.970
 very large 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.979
 of the small calf grows as 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.410
 these 13-month-old bulls that are in 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.080
 proof of weight gain to pasture up to 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.349
 to arrive at the uirapuru that he did to the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.830
 brazil from 2006 or cherub that 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.750
 had marbling measured at 2.76 near the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.180
 three points of a taurine 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.820
 or Indian who had several children 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.430
 in technical slaughterings and puts 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.200
 kjarkas in their children as it shows 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.110
 stool radius 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.270
 everyone here goes through field trials 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.820
 before making track history 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.360
 this concern to identify who 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.090
 must if it be the bulls and the matrices 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.870
 who should leave descendants is this is the 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.990
 essence of the selection, do not you do it well 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.640
 or poorly depending on the technologies that 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.880
 is used to help you choose 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.010
 logical that the feeling of the creator 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.100
 choosing the animal is very important not 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.080
 and here we see the bulls still 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.540
 are on the counter that also shows your 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.570
 potential as these mothers up to 15 years of age 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.030
 of life and with good breeding on foot thanks to 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.430
 condition of breastfeeding well without 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.250
 specific handling for milk that 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.510
 was the focus of this selection this moment the 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.080
 Field Day gathered farms 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.320
 cast proof from time to time 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.050
 a drug addict demonstrated here these 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.660
 cows were the first recorded by 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.800
 arnaldo castilho in the dairy control of 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.030
 ABC 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.280
 these females view all mothers of large 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.940
 calves that will produce meat from 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.979
 quality 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.110
 the dell de castilho before left all 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.760
 cow's milk for the young but 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.040
 decided to control production until 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.130
 to turn a heifer into a bisector 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.540
 in feileite champion with up production 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.360
 two pounds 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.330
 other mothers also show this highlight 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.740
 that turns the economic result in 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.530
 terms of volume 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.350
 she stares at her if at the pit they give because 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.700
 she leaves a weaned product then a 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.300
 source of income of the milk producer 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.700
 wanting or not and the milk itself the volume 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.650
 with quality also because everyone 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.510
 today's race data compiled 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.040
 in terms of milk quality comes 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.800
 showing that the breed has up to one 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.500
 development than we do 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.600
 we expect the potential growth of 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.930
 percentage of fat and protein in the 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.940
 milk there, not only his product 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.280
 calf 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.550
 milk the quality milk that will give a 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.980
 economic return for him is fantastic 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.530
 is cut in milk or in the SIM 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.780
 complete is tested with half way 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.360
 to those who want income in the 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.100
 field looks at the eyes eyes the bacteria that 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.250
 We came today, right? 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.760
 in the lectures he presents is small 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.840
 but not steal had good valeu boi is a 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.840
 enterprise is this result 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.230
 economic economy with even when 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.420
 same and if we need you to 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.000
 can not lose the chance to gain weight 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.500
 the team of fattening the pocket with a 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.500
 race that only grows
