00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
effective is the way that I'm going to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.880 
effective is the way that I'm going to
tie<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.610> legs<00:03:19.880> or<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.310> strips<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.380> I'm

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
tie in the legs or the strips so I'm

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.729 
tie in the legs or the strips so I'm
going<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.070> turn<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.489> back<00:03:25.550> over<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.739> I'm

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
going to turn this back over and I'm

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.020 
going to turn this back over and I'm
going<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.040> grab<00:03:28.310> two<00:03:29.770> pine<00:03:30.770> squirrel<00:03:31.100> zonked

going to grab two pine squirrel zonked
crawdad<00:03:32.989> orange<00:03:33.410> strips<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.690> way<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:35.840> do

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
crawdad orange strips and the way I do

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.960 
crawdad orange strips and the way I do
this<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.350> I'm<00:03:36.590> going<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.830> tie<00:03:37.040> these<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:37.489> right

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
this is I'm going to tie these in right

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.400 
this is I'm going to tie these in right
at<00:03:38.840> where<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.709> tail<00:03:40.040> would<00:03:40.340> be<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:42.260> what

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
at where the tail would be but what

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.290 
at where the tail would be but what
happens<00:03:42.770> is<00:03:42.890> these<00:03:43.160> are<00:03:43.220> going<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.520> move<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:44.090> lot

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
happens is these are going to move a lot

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.880 
happens is these are going to move a lot
more<00:03:44.330> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> water<00:03:44.900> than<00:03:45.110> if<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.500> tied

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
more in the water than if I just tied

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.910 
more in the water than if I just tied
them<00:03:46.070> right<00:03:46.220> here<00:03:46.459> as<00:03:46.610> claws<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:48.350> it's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
them right here as claws so it's it's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.949 
them right here as claws so it's it's
not<00:03:49.040> an<00:03:49.310> exact<00:03:49.730> imitation<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.360> crawdad<00:03:50.630> but

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
not an exact imitation of a crawdad but

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.690 
not an exact imitation of a crawdad but
the<00:03:51.050> way<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.440> moves<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:51.890> water<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.459> just

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
the way it moves in the water is just

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.910 
the way it moves in the water is just
phenomenal<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.959> I'm<00:03:54.110> just<00:03:54.290> tie<00:03:54.500> these<00:03:54.560> in

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
phenomenal so I'm just tie these in

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.590 
phenomenal so I'm just tie these in
right<00:03:55.130> there<00:03:55.370> again<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.209> should<00:03:56.390> get<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
right there again I should get the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.090 
right there again I should get the
length<00:03:56.810> though<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.380> if<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.709> know<00:03:57.800> if<00:03:57.890> there

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
length though so if you know if there

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.070 
length though so if you know if there
are<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:59.000> would<00:03:59.209> be<00:03:59.330> about<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> same<00:03:59.810> as<00:03:59.870> the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
are they would be about the same as the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.570 
are they would be about the same as the
claws<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.650> stuff<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.980> tied<00:04:01.190> in<00:04:01.340> at<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.550> eye

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
claws and the stuff I tied in at the eye

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.530 
claws and the stuff I tied in at the eye
again<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:02.630> more<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.930> an<00:04:03.019> imitation

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
again it's more of an imitation

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
again it's more of an imitation
suggested<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.660> not<00:04:05.810> an<00:04:05.959> exact<00:04:06.350> imitation

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
suggested it's not an exact imitation

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.980 
suggested it's not an exact imitation
I'm<00:04:09.560> gonna<00:04:09.830> cinch<00:04:10.130> these<00:04:10.370> down

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.800 

okay<00:04:14.990> and<00:04:16.209> again<00:04:17.209> those<00:04:17.390> are<00:04:17.420> going<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> go

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
okay and again those are going to go

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.900 
okay and again those are going to go
back<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.290> way<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.890> fly<00:04:19.070> will<00:04:19.250> sit<00:04:19.490> of<00:04:19.640> course

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
back the way the fly will sit of course

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.810 
back the way the fly will sit of course
is<00:04:20.120> upside<00:04:20.450> down<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:21.020> so<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.950> see<00:04:22.190> that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
is upside down and so you can see that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.010 
is upside down and so you can see that
these<00:04:23.000> will<00:04:24.070> will<00:04:25.070> flap<00:04:25.670> freely<00:04:26.180> once<00:04:26.750> this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
these will will flap freely once this

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.220 
these will will flap freely once this
fly<00:04:27.260> is<00:04:27.320> moving<00:04:27.680> through<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.950> water<00:04:29.230> and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
fly is moving through the water and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.560 
fly is moving through the water and
because<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.160> weedless<00:04:31.670> with<00:04:32.030> this<00:04:32.180> wire<00:04:32.360> we

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
because it's weedless with this wire we

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.810 
because it's weedless with this wire we
guard<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.140> going<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.350> foul<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.610> last

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
guard it's not going to foul so the last

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.070 
guard it's not going to foul so the last
thing<00:04:35.060> I'm<00:04:35.240> going<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.420> do<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.750> I'm<00:04:35.900> going<00:04:36.020> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.320 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
tie<00:04:36.320> in<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.530> little<00:04:36.770> fan<00:04:37.070> tail<00:04:37.340> then<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.240> I'm

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
tie in a little fan tail then what I'm

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.820

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
is that you get this end of the fly with

is that you get this end of the fly with
the<00:04:44.540> barbell<00:04:45.050> eyes<00:04:45.250> that's<00:04:46.250> going<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.580> be

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
the barbell eyes that's going to be

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
going to be buoyed up by the foam so you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.650 
going to be buoyed up by the foam so you
you<00:04:51.560> get<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> lot<00:04:52.160> of<00:04:52.460> movement<00:04:52.820> as<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.420> thing

you get a lot of movement as this thing

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.460 
you get a lot of movement as this thing
goes<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.050> water

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
goes in the water

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.530 
goes in the water
couple<00:04:55.040> that<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:55.280> these<00:04:55.700> legs<00:04:56.000> going<00:04:56.270> up<00:04:56.360> and

down<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.930> it's<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.980> really<00:04:58.370> really<00:04:58.550> good

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
down and it's a really really good

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.540 
down and it's a really really good
pattern<00:04:59.420> for<00:04:59.630> when<00:05:00.500> you've<00:05:00.620> got<00:05:00.800> crawdads<00:05:01.400> in
