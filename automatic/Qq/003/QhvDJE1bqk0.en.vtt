00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it was close which it was went close to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
it was close which it was went close to
that<00:00:58.020> sure<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> fact<00:00:58.800> let's<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.460> at

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that sure that in fact let's look at

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.240 
that sure that in fact let's look at
what<00:00:59.850> she<00:01:00.539> wouldn't<00:01:00.719> wriggles<00:01:00.989> first<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
what she wouldn't wriggles first so that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.529 
what she wouldn't wriggles first so that
would<00:01:02.399> explain<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.730> wriggles<00:01:03.210> an<00:01:03.270> attack

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
would explain it wriggles an attack

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.710 
would explain it wriggles an attack
speed<00:01:03.930> you'll<00:01:04.830> notice<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
speed you'll notice that I actually you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
speed you'll notice that I actually you
know<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> 1400<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> hadn't<00:01:08.159> spent<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.760> she

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
know I 1400 that I hadn't spent so she

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
know I 1400 that I hadn't spent so she
had<00:01:09.659> armor<00:01:10.340> she<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:11.939> this

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
had armor she actually think at this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
had armor she actually think at this
point<00:01:12.119> she's<00:01:13.080> armed<00:01:13.680> acquainted<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.400> on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
point she's armed acquainted or on

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
point she's armed acquainted or on
marooned<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.049> well<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.560> she<00:01:16.710> had

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
marooned as well so I think she had

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.320 
marooned as well so I think she had
almost<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> hundred<00:01:17.250> armor<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
almost a hundred armor so now at this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.890 
almost a hundred armor so now at this
point<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:19.680> low<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
point out and is pretty low so if you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
point out and is pretty low so if you
had<00:01:22.110> better<00:01:22.259> lifesteal<00:01:22.920> better<00:01:23.850> armor<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
had better lifesteal better armor so

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.260 
had better lifesteal better armor so
that<00:01:25.439> would

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
that would

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.660 
that would
sense<00:01:26.659> why<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.770> was<00:01:27.859> closer<00:01:28.130> than<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.490> should

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
sense why that was closer than it should

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.270 
sense why that was closer than it should
have<00:01:28.700> been<00:01:29.469> but<00:01:30.469> luckily<00:01:30.649> it<00:01:30.890> was<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.159> we

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
have been but luckily it was that we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.130 
have been but luckily it was that we
