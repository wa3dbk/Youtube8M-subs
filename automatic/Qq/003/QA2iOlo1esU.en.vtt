then<00:02:49.830> such<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> planet<00:02:51.240> becomes<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> best

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
then such a planet becomes the best

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.710 
then such a planet becomes the best
planet<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.010> case<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.090> here

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
planet and in this case you can see here

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.410 
planet and in this case you can see here
that<00:02:54.990> Venus<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> lord<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.120> this

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that Venus is the lord of this and this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.520 
that Venus is the lord of this and this
house<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:58.740> Venus<00:02:59.730> has<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.600> Maracana<00:03:01.260> over

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.699 
house and Venus has the Maracana over
here<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> Venus<00:03:03.720> will<00:03:04.140> predominantly

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
here and so Venus will predominantly

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.350 
here and so Venus will predominantly
give<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> results<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> ninth<00:03:05.910> Oh<00:03:06.120> which

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
give the results of the ninth Oh which

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.380 
give the results of the ninth Oh which
is<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.720> house<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.020> watch<00:03:07.290> oh<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.390> hopelessly

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
is the house of watch oh and hopelessly

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.320 
is the house of watch oh and hopelessly
Venus<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.900> number<00:03:10.230> one<00:03:10.410> good<00:03:10.680> planet<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
Venus is the number one good planet and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.199 
Venus is the number one good planet and
when<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> comes<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> functional<00:03:13.470> malefic

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
when it comes to the functional malefic

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.090 
when it comes to the functional malefic
Jupiter<00:03:15.209> tops<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.660> list<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.890> if

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
Jupiter tops the list that is because if

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.130 
Jupiter tops the list that is because if
it<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> owner<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> LA<00:03:17.940> with<00:03:18.090> house<00:03:18.300> you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it is the owner of the LA with house you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.050 
it is the owner of the LA with house you
can<00:03:19.320> see<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.530> over<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.190> there<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
can see it over here and there is a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.470 
can see it over here and there is a
negative<00:03:21.720> house<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:24.650> therefore<00:03:26.269> Jupiter<00:03:27.269> is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
negative house and therefore Jupiter is

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.860 
negative house and therefore Jupiter is
the<00:03:27.989> number<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.680> malefic<00:03:29.519> another<00:03:30.480> reason

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
the number one malefic another reason

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.949 
the number one malefic another reason
for<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.880> Jupiter<00:03:32.880> also<00:03:33.030> rules<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.660> second

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
for that is Jupiter also rules a second

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.590 
for that is Jupiter also rules a second
house<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.410> high-stress<00:03:35.370> house<00:03:35.580> also<00:03:36.209> known<00:03:36.390> as

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the second house which usually causes

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.509 
the second house which usually causes
great<00:03:42.239> danger<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.690> life<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.489> that

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
great danger to life so with all that

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.630 
great danger to life so with all that
you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.330> surely<00:03:45.720> say<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.170> tip<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.040> the

sixth of the bad moves and therefore
moon<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.140> number<00:04:09.380> two<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:11.390> number

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
moon is the number two and the number

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.240 
moon is the number two and the number
three<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.260> marsh<00:04:13.930> functional<00:04:14.930> malefic<00:04:15.250> that

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
three is marsh functional malefic that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.250 
three is marsh functional malefic that
is<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:16.640> mass<00:04:16.880> owns<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.630> third<00:04:17.870> hose<00:04:18.049> you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
is because mass owns the third hose you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.099 
is because mass owns the third hose you
can<00:04:18.290> see<00:04:18.650> third<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.220> over<00:04:19.459> here<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.109> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
can see third is over here and the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.500 
can see third is over here and the
Mallick<00:04:21.440> economist<00:04:22.100> falls<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:23.240> the

Mallick economist falls in in the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
pharaohs and that is the reason why he

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.650 
pharaohs and that is the reason why he
is<00:04:26.360> listed<00:04:27.290> here<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:28.000> wonder<00:04:29.000> what<00:04:29.150> happened<00:04:29.510> to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
is listed here I wonder what happened to

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.870 
is listed here I wonder what happened to
the<00:04:29.810> tenth<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.230> lordship<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.920> tenth<00:04:31.670> house

the tenth of lordship the tenth house

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.590 
the tenth of lordship the tenth house
not<00:04:33.010> actually<00:04:34.010> should<00:04:34.640> have<00:04:34.760> made<00:04:34.970> much<00:04:35.270> very

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
not actually should have made much very

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.830 
not actually should have made much very
good<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:37.400> unfortunately<00:04:37.610> what<00:04:38.390> has<00:04:38.510> happened

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
good but unfortunately what has happened

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.440 
good but unfortunately what has happened
is<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:38.960> can<00:04:39.230> see<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.700> more<00:04:40.700> of<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.240> third

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
is you can see that more of the third

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.350 
is you can see that more of the third
hose<00:04:41.630> reserves<00:04:42.020> will<00:04:42.230> be<00:04:43.100> delivered<00:04:43.910> by<00:04:44.090> mass

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
hose reserves will be delivered by mass

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.409 
hose reserves will be delivered by mass
because<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.620> molecular<00:04:46.070> Cana<00:04:46.250> falls<00:04:46.610> in<00:04:47.300> the

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
because the molecular Cana falls in the

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.940 
because the molecular Cana falls in the
third<00:04:47.600> house<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:49.780> when<00:04:50.780> talking<00:04:51.440> about<00:04:51.650> the

third house and when talking about the

may wonder why not include Sun in the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.500 
may wonder why not include Sun in the
functional<00:05:07.370> malefic<00:05:07.970> list<00:05:08.450> but<00:05:09.910> sudden<00:05:10.910> the

functional malefic list but sudden the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.430 
functional malefic list but sudden the
sound<00:05:11.750> cloud<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.169> not<00:05:12.320> all<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.650> bad<00:05:12.890> except

sound cloud is not all that bad except

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
once or twice in life he can cause the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.560 
once or twice in life he can cause the
danger<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.470> life<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.919> try<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.000> she<00:05:20.180> can<00:05:20.360> give

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
danger to life and try and she can give

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.409 
danger to life and try and she can give
stress<00:05:20.900> which<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.830> usually<00:05:22.640> part<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:23.090> human

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
stress which is usually part of human

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.630 
stress which is usually part of human
existence<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.560> therefore<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:25.070> is<00:05:25.190> not<00:05:25.340> such<00:05:25.610> a

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
existence so therefore it is not such a

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.450 
existence so therefore it is not such a
negative<00:05:26.540> house<00:05:26.960> when<00:05:27.260> compared<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.950> these

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
negative house when compared to these

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.600 
negative house when compared to these
three<00:05:28.700> then<00:05:29.419> we<00:05:29.630> have<00:05:29.810> one<00:05:29.990> more<00:05:30.229> which<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
three then we have one more which is the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.790 
three then we have one more which is the
last<00:05:31.850> one<00:05:32.120> mercury<00:05:32.600> and<00:05:33.310> mercury<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:36.680> out

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
last one mercury and mercury is that out

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.350 
last one mercury and mercury is that out
of<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.010> fifth<00:05:37.250> house<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.760> lot<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.150> eighth

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
of the fifth house and lot of the eighth

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.040 
of the fifth house and lot of the eighth
of<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:40.160> fifth<00:05:40.370> is<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.700> good<00:05:40.970> house<00:05:41.180> so<00:05:41.990> you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
of so the fifth is a good house so you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.969 
of so the fifth is a good house so you
should<00:05:42.470> say<00:05:42.650> that

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
should say that

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.210 
should say that
mercury<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:43.550> good<00:05:44.200> more<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.350> good<00:05:45.560> will<00:05:46.040> come

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
mercury is good more of good will come

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.210 
mercury is good more of good will come
from<00:05:46.280> mercury<00:05:46.820> but<00:05:47.510> also<00:05:47.870> sometimes<00:05:48.560> on<00:05:48.919> and

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
from mercury but also sometimes on and

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.790 
from mercury but also sometimes on and
off<00:05:49.340> negative<00:05:49.880> things<00:05:50.180> can<00:05:50.470> come<00:05:51.470> from

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
off negative things can come from

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800 
off negative things can come from
mercury<00:05:52.340> because<00:05:52.729> he<00:05:52.880> is<00:05:52.940> a<00:05:53.090> lot<00:05:53.510> of<00:05:53.690> the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
mercury because he is a lot of the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.200 
mercury because he is a lot of the
eighth<00:05:53.990> house<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:54.530> mercury<00:05:55.430> has<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.910> mood<00:05:56.120> of
