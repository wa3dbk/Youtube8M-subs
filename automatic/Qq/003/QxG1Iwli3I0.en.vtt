00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.860
 mini worlds constructions in few 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.570
 seconds hello friends welcome to the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.599
 first chapter of mini worlds in this 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.570
 I will not teach you how to do anything 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.090
 but I'm going to show you a city 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.460
 good in this on this occasion the city 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.900
 is the metropolis built by the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.919
 user 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.919
 velux 30 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.119
 that belongs to the community of kingdoms 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.680
 íberos it good if you want I visited 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.590
 this city, why do you make uan 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 metropolis appreciate 'aces' for here it's worth 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.170
 good as you can see is a city 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.860
 modern with very modern buildings like 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.000
 It can be this east of chalets flats 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.160
 skyscraper as we can see in the distance 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.040
 like here 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.220
 in smaller houses with their 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.880
 east road for example is the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.740
 town hall 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.860
 and good 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.630
 the included hospital that must be of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.490
 private health since it does not have 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.410
 absolutely nothing inside this 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.540
 user there are not many times that you do not 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.820
 like they do not like to save them for 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.190
 inside and makes them good outside now 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.250
 for example, let's see, I'm here 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.880
 There are some houses that seem to walk 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 beach then it has its metro network 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 that other cities are tied by 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 example the one of holy grass the right in 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 ataun that is foolish and good to see what 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.500
 more similar there in the distance we have what 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.390
 which is the cinema with 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.450
 with its parking and everything is good 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.700
 pretty good inside with his 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.340
 popcorn box their two of the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.850
 cinema rooms of central bathrooms 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.830
 let's see for example a movie theater 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.580
 Well, as you can see, there is a 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.460
 movie that apart from lights bastard ay 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.140
 sorry forgiveness is these problems the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.920
 direct here there was 1 watching it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.820
 the wool in order to see that other things like that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.650
 for example the mcdonald's what 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 that this I think is not his design 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.310
 exactly but good here until there is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.610
 pretty nice one try to jump the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 typical fence and we will see that a 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.690
 administrator brand 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.810
 here as if to see if he eats all 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.210
 days even if they are potatoes or rotten meat 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.790
 the typical 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.150
 here we have the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.530
 well a gas station that is pretty 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.420
 pretty curious inside even 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.519
 you can buy things and here is the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.950
 hotel this hotel is pretty nice what 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.739
 built in a very short time but for 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 example let's go to the area of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.629
 reception 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.940
 a receptionist here how are you going to 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.580
 record the administrator sucking camera 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.410
 good for example with its free buffet 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.210
 with its tables etc 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.530
 then more rooms are very 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.640
 well decorated that I had told you a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.580
 like to decorate because they do it when 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.760
 decorate look for example is here with 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 your bathroom your stone bed the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.360
 typical not everyone tastes me clean and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.740
 well look at the pool although you have 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.410
 hot, I can talk there 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.240
 outside yes without any problem 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.850
 and not all are rooms for example 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.819
 up here the congress hall here to 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.219
 the spies 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.159
 and that building there has the 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.959
 Rooms the rooms vips that 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.760
 they are moving festering inside me 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.800
 in his day I said I wanted a so I 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.960
 stay 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.450
 the plant below I think if we go to the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.600
 downstairs and we have the first room 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.880
 vip that is also with all its luxuries and 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.080
 your TV kitchen living room 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.570
 jacuzzi 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.610
 another stone bed in here all 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.280
 they will use and good 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.430
 we already have the shopping center 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 down here with its parking and everything 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.150
 I have seen the center is connected 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.030
 commercial has a very central style 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.299
 I think it's also not his the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.040
 style of your site but good with your 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.650
 small trees and all that typical 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.400
 they have this and good before when I told you 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.500

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.150
 good that it took to make this church 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.940
