when<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> got<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.970> knife<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.450> thought<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> would

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when I got this knife I thought it would

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.630 
when I got this knife I thought it would
be<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.710> bit<00:01:22.979> bigger<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.220> mean

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
be a little bit bigger but when I I mean

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.670 
be a little bit bigger but when I I mean
I<00:01:26.670> had<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> knife<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> week<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I had this knife for about a week now I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
I had this knife for about a week now I
think<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.670> haven't<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> through

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
think I mean I haven't put it through

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.620 
think I mean I haven't put it through
the<00:01:30.540> ultimate<00:01:30.570> test<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.979> sharpened<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the ultimate test by sharpened it got a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
the ultimate test by sharpened it got a
little<00:01:33.869> cut<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> mean<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.759> not

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
little cut from it but I mean I'm not

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
little cut from it but I mean I'm not
gonna<00:01:36.119> hold<00:01:36.299> any<00:01:36.570> grudge<00:01:36.750> against<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
gonna hold any grudge against it so you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
gonna hold any grudge against it so you
actually<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> open<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> hold

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
actually when you open when you hold

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.550 
actually when you open when you hold
this<00:01:40.049> down<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.520> actually<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.200> pull<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
this down you actually can pull the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.569 
this down you actually can pull the
little<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.340> don't<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.430> what

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
little you know like I don't know what

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.660 
little you know like I don't know what
you<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> call<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.350> spines<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:50.360> grips<00:01:51.360> or

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
you want to call it spines or grips or

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
you want to call it spines or grips or
whatever<00:01:53.930> close<00:01:54.950> open<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> close<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
whatever close open and close it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.440 
whatever close open and close it
beforehand<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.930> mean<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.159> might<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.329> as

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
beforehand I mean it might not be as

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.310 
beforehand I mean it might not be as
fast<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.590> hands<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.869> it's<00:02:03.869> most

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
fast with one two hands but it's most

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.180 
fast with one two hands but it's most
definitely<00:02:04.469> easier<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.310> two<00:02:05.490> pans<00:02:06.979> there<00:02:07.979> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
definitely easier with two pans there is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.330 
definitely easier with two pans there is
a<00:02:08.220> couple<00:02:08.700> models<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.709> there's<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:10.800> model

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a couple models of it there's one model

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.720 
a couple models of it there's one model
where<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
where it's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.009 
where it's
this<00:02:13.360> handle<00:02:14.879> coders<00:02:15.879> handle<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.840> also

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
this handle coders handle and it also

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.530 
this handle coders handle and it also
has<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.349> coated<00:02:17.709> blade<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:18.700> sure<00:02:18.849> there's<00:02:19.390> an

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
has a coated blade for sure there's an

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
has a coated blade for sure there's an
orange<00:02:19.900> handle<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.830> there's<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.250> light

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
orange handle then there's just a light

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.080 
orange handle then there's just a light
blue<00:02:21.610> handle<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.530> specs<00:02:23.860> are<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:25.360> blade<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.900> 2

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
blue handle the specs are the blade is 2

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.070 
blue handle the specs are the blade is 2
7<00:02:28.090> 8<00:02:28.299> inches<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:34.000> knife<00:02:34.269> has<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.569> bottle

7 8 inches the this knife has a bottle
opener<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:36.150> don't<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.750> how<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.579> a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
opener I don't really see how this is a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.630 
opener I don't really see how this is a
bottle<00:02:40.000> opener<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.860> review<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.340> did<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
bottle opener like with a review I did a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.410 
bottle opener like with a review I did a
little<00:02:42.849> bit<00:02:43.030> ago

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
little bit ago

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.729 
little bit ago
the<00:02:43.840> CRC<00:02:44.170> hole-in-one<00:02:45.629> it<00:02:46.629> had<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.470> same

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
the CRC hole-in-one it had like the same

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.170 
the CRC hole-in-one it had like the same
thing<00:02:48.099> on<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.459> see<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.849> how<00:02:51.879> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
thing on it see I don't know how that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.309 
thing on it see I don't know how that
works<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.900> bottle<00:02:53.769> opener<00:02:54.359> but<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.660> mean<00:02:56.109> I

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
works so bottle opener but I mean I

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.020 
works so bottle opener but I mean I
guess<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.890> would<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.040> better<00:02:57.400> than<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.819> using

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
guess it would be better than just using

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.690 
guess it would be better than just using
their<00:02:58.329> hands<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.650> don't<00:02:59.920> really<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.489> how

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
their hands but I don't really see how

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.319 
their hands but I don't really see how
it's<00:03:01.739> classified<00:03:02.739> as<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.069> bottle<00:03:03.519> opener<00:03:04.709> um

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
okay this knife has a pocket clip so you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.670 
okay this knife has a pocket clip so you
can't<00:03:12.640> really<00:03:13.000> use<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.450> knife<00:03:13.690> for<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> lefty

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049

then opening and closing and so but it's

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.599 
then opening and closing and so but it's
not<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.290> easy<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:50.769> if<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.310> had

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
not as easy you just if you just had

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.950 
not as easy you just if you just had
your<00:03:51.639> right<00:03:51.849> hand<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.329> it

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.990 

so<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.380> knife<00:03:58.590> was<00:03:58.740> fairly<00:03:59.340> sharp<00:03:59.760> when<00:03:59.910> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
so this knife was fairly sharp when I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.150 
so this knife was fairly sharp when I
opened<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.720> wasn't<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.740> some<00:04:02.010> knives

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
opened it it wasn't like some knives

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
words you can't even cut through rope

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.840 
words you can't even cut through rope
this<00:04:06.270> knife<00:04:06.570> was<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.900> very<00:04:07.290> good<00:04:07.530> knife<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:08.700> has

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
I think I mentioned earlier how it was a

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.510 
I think I mentioned earlier how it was a
little<00:05:22.650> bit<00:05:22.830> smaller<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:24.770> don't<00:05:25.770> actually<00:05:26.010> know

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520

little bit smaller I don't actually know
how<00:05:27.240> long<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.200> could<00:05:29.070> measure<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.820> just

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
how long it is I could measure it I just

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.659 
how long it is I could measure it I just
don't<00:05:30.210> know<00:05:30.360> where<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.650> ruler<00:05:31.650> is<00:05:31.860> don't<00:05:32.550> want

don't know where a ruler is don't want
to<00:05:32.730> take<00:05:32.850> too<00:05:33.000> long<00:05:33.380> but<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:36.770> mean<00:05:37.770> if<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.640> want

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
to take too long but I mean if you want

if you're looking for a good sturdy work

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.550 
if you're looking for a good sturdy work
knife<00:05:41.850> I<00:05:42.210> would<00:05:42.600> have<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.020> say<00:05:43.169> this<00:05:43.350> is

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
knife I would have to say this is

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.790 
knife I would have to say this is
probably<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.040> one<00:05:44.160> for<00:05:44.370> you<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:45.350> mean<00:05:46.350> I'm<00:05:46.470> if

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
probably the one for you I mean I'm if

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.719 
probably the one for you I mean I'm if
you're<00:05:47.370> lefty<00:05:48.710> that's<00:05:49.710> where<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.160> problem<00:05:50.580> is

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
you're lefty that's where the problem is

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.890 
you're lefty that's where the problem is
I<00:05:51.000> mean<00:05:51.620> it'd<00:05:52.620> be<00:05:52.650> nice<00:05:52.950> if<00:05:53.010> they<00:05:53.400> had<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.900> maybe

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
I mean it'd be nice if they had a maybe

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.920 
I mean it'd be nice if they had a maybe
move<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:56.010> lock<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.610> put<00:05:56.940> it<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.810> other

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
move this lock and put it on the other

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.659 
move this lock and put it on the other
side<00:05:58.229> and<00:05:58.440> took<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.650> pocket<00:05:58.979> clip<00:05:59.130> off<00:05:59.310> or

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
side and took the pocket clip off or

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.719 
side and took the pocket clip off or
move<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.419> pocket<00:06:00.750> clip<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.169> other<00:06:01.200> side

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
move the pocket clip to the other side

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.920 
move the pocket clip to the other side
so<00:06:02.729> then<00:06:02.880> you<00:06:03.000> could<00:06:03.120> just<00:06:03.150> have<00:06:03.390> it<00:06:03.479> down<00:06:03.600> here

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
so then you could just have it down here

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.860 
so then you could just have it down here
and<00:06:04.080> have<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.530> lock<00:06:04.740> here<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.160> lock<00:06:05.310> here<00:06:05.870> so
