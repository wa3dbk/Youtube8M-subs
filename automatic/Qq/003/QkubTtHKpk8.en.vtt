00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
I have bought one and a half kilos here

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.360 
I have bought one and a half kilos here
I'm<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.299> have<00:03:09.540> used<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.439> required<00:03:11.040> amount<00:03:11.159> of

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
that there are three steps in this the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.390 
that there are three steps in this the
first<00:03:24.569> step<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.810> roasting<00:03:25.469> the<00:03:25.620> spices<00:03:26.250> and
