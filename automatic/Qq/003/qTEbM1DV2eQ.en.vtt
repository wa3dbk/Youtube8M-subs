00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello dear friends and today we are 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.210
 We will consider a mod which 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 called arma status is thin which is needed 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.270
 for version 146, see our example 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.830
 have leather armor we dress her like 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.310
 just as soon as we put it on 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 we have in the lower left shows 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 the status of this armor 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.930
 white then try pit to us us 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.140
 weaned under rise we take a look 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.210
 falling approximate scheme and we removed 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.520
 hp but from the armor of what is the world as soon as we 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.239
 take another item on the list 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.809
 quantity 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.820
 still available broken globe help 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 this for this example, I still can 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 break 248 example items here 248 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.189
 alma 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.560
 I still fit in I take in hand 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.570
 The diamond block example is unusual for how many 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 I also have it in stock to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 example from take so many applovin 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 immersed warehouse writes to me yet 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.330
 there are three hundred seventy seven blocks 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 diamond it is very convenient when you 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 build a house and it helps to know enough 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.439
 whether you still have the resources or not and here in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 than this plus what you see you can 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.780
 only about maybe you need 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.290
 go for a new pickax since your 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.990
 because already slowly we begin to break 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.079
 always save what is this little 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 the green line at the bottom so it is sometimes 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.290
 that imperceptibly it is not clear yet 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.500
 how many blocks and and enough this mod 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.659
 he is very good at helping with this 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 now let's for example 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.880
 sleep like a skeleton constantly night 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:10.830
 she shoots us 5585 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:20.660
 taken away all that takes away too 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:20.660
 a sublease would kill us was going to happen 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.560
 Bashkir you want is equally subtracted 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.519
 the same number of units now 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.780
 example now for what i love 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:50.100
 you have arrows you fight on which 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.459
 Well, very difficult club arena and you need 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.900
 always know how many arrows you have here 2 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.470
 stack are arrows and so you have 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:07.410
 how much more power is being written from 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.720
 your stop and execute about creative here it is 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.239
 yet how many arrows do you have 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.329
 example throw out ninety on our nose 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.690
 three arrows back 256 3 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.120
 it is very comfortable and then especially when 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.010
 was your you know an example you may not 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.680
 kill the enemy you need to know how much 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.930
 you have to learn a plate 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.480
 when you can run back but for new 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.810
 batches of arrows it is very convenient just 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.290
 even though we have arrows, but they 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.030
 as long as you still have them left 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 actually the mod is very small but he 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.549
 very simple well complements maykravt 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:49.579
 I advise everyone to put it like 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.579
