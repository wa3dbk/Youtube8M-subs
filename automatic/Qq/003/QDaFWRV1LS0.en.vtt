00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 i 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.180
 hi how good are we going towards 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.420
 most outstanding statistics of 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.789
 volkswagen golf gti 2015 as you see 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.920
 the initials gti are everywhere and 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.440
 the tires of our unit on 18 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 otegi series series are very 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.429
 well and also if we sing them some rubber bands 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 245 40 30 18 have a grip 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.269
 spectacular 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.010
 from behind it may look like a volkswagen 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.090
 normal golf but if we go to the engine 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.060
 no the engine is the 2 liter turbo engine 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.040
 of the loop volkswagen golf gti this one is 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.300
 coupled to a manual gearbox 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.210
 6 speeds allowing you 240 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.950
 horsepower and reach 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.450
 perfectly the 270 kilometers by 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.220
 hour 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.930
 now we go to the interior 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.430
 inside nothing else we enter 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.350
 we see the initials gt 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.650
 and now let's sit in the seat 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.180
 of the product 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.500
 the scorecard as we see 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.030
 odometer marks to 300 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.040
 and the girls that you will go on 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.080
 finding on the steering wheel and in the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.350
 seats that have very good support 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 side 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.159
 and the change is the six manual 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.159
 speeds 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.830
 the interior is that of a volkswagen golf 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.900
 anyone but with small touches 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 sports so we do not forget about 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.080
 that we are inside a sports car 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.240
 that can sing perfectly of the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.660
 270 to 280 kilometers per hour as a brand 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.660
 the odometer 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.230
 and although you can not miss in a car 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.900
 this power and gasoline is an escape 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.240
 appropriate this car and bring it though to 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.860
 simple sight may seem normal this 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.490
 exhaust produces a very beautiful sound that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.110
 it was worth listening 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 and good to see today's video 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.770
 I hope you liked and good until 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770
 soon
