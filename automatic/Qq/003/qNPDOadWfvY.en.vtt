00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 just four months very easy very short 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 only those who can tilt for you anyway 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:31.199
 So we'll do it if it's alright 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 tells me that I have as yet 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.079
 never made so the key w acts 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.260
 as a catalyst of a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.600
 when they move against 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 directed radical objects 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 in combination with the space bar to one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 Overcoming these obstacles I say 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:04.850
 Mum could also dodge there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.810
 Brakes loses 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.579
 I was about it 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.649
 just jumping so well can raise 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.649
 thoughts continue to leap 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 okay that's it with the way to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.030
 Collector I do not know that is 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.690
 actually a bit on the job or 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:33.490
 the beginning was that at the beginning of the set 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:35.640
 also be harmless here okay the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.570
 problem so detailed 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.540
 We say yes, these are the simple ones 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.760
 the easy ones are the problem though 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.080
 Here we present here at this 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 by the lack 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.590
 that is populism sometimes again 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.509
 know there are many nice jumping 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.490
 devils just have to see more and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.340
 So again just go up high 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.930
 wishes or completely disoriented 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.420
 and you jump through the wall here 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.070
 is the second thing you need to know 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.869
 that's right there I'm looking for a while 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:12.440
 well that can happen then 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:16.640
 that you can do twice or not 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.330
 where are we headed for ? 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.959
 prevents this band determined and then 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.850
 It's all over this little path 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.500
 on so the interior and now have to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:38.630
 Let's turn back I turn 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 the 74 small should the topic yes 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.260
 exactly meet 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 I often need a little bit circumstance 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.030
 that you can just in the first day or 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.350
 Orientation that you know again 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.930
 where to be on rain order this is endboss 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.340
 great opponent 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.380
 I trustingly press one 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.970
 button two buttons three buttons and 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.459
 clearly a bit, namely clone and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.049
 then I read exploding and somehow 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.049
 were poor what was in the window 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:24.530
 well, the half has something extra 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.790
 actually clooneys would come on 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.170
 do nothing and then you leave them 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.480
 explode and be 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.540
 well I Sale me with the people 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.230
 to be dementia christian prince is already 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.830
 that's the focus 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.849
 ok well even without the opponent from 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.540
 Okay what's the time 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.159
 klosters disappears badly 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.980
 okay those are with a computer game 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.840
 but we have to work effectively yes 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.959
 okay and just jump down and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.530
 is where that comes portal beginning of 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.490
