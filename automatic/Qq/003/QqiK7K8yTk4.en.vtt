00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
need to find a new job but here's where

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.480 
need to find a new job but here's where
we<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.600> let's<00:01:58.079> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
we are so let's take a look at the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
we are so let's take a look at the
actual<00:01:59.700> compartments<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.680> fit

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
actual compartments and what you fit

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
actual compartments and what you fit
inside<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.060> some<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> internal

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
inside them and so some of the internal

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.889
