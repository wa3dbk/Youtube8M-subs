00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.000 

I<00:00:16.240> give<00:00:16.960> them<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.170> hand<00:00:17.380> cleaning<00:00:17.740> their

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
I give them a hand cleaning their

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.610 
I give them a hand cleaning their
celebrity<00:00:18.610> red<00:00:18.880> carpet<00:00:19.420> they're<00:00:20.080> gonna<00:00:20.260> help

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.620 
celebrity red carpet they're gonna help

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:38.590 
celebrity red carpet they're gonna help
me<00:00:20.800> out<00:00:20.830> with<00:00:21.160> an<00:00:21.280> investigation

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.020 

Tom<00:00:39.260> having<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:39.860> do<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.160> cleaning<00:00:40.400> I<00:00:40.700> keep

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
Tom having to do the cleaning I keep

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.960 
Tom having to do the cleaning I keep
getting<00:00:41.239> these<00:00:41.510> shots<00:00:41.870> ouch<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.220> soles<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:43.790> my

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
getting these shots ouch the soles of my

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.240 
getting these shots ouch the soles of my
shoes<00:00:44.000> are<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.900> carpet<00:00:45.380> there<00:00:46.130> are

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
shoes are on the carpet there are

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.670 
shoes are on the carpet there are
millions<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.820> tiny<00:00:47.150> positive<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.140> negative

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
millions of tiny positive and negative

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.610 
millions of tiny positive and negative
charges<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.309> my<00:00:49.520> shoe<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.570> carpet<00:00:51.020> you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
charges on my shoe and the carpet you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.939 
charges on my shoe and the carpet you
can't<00:00:51.860> see<00:00:52.160> them<00:00:52.430> because<00:00:52.550> they're<00:00:52.879> invisible

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
can't see them because they're invisible

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.680 
can't see them because they're invisible
but<00:00:54.949> when<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.220> rub<00:00:55.489> my<00:00:55.699> shoe<00:00:55.970> on<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.150> carpet

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
but when I rub my shoe on the carpet

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.660 
but when I rub my shoe on the carpet
some<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.559> negative<00:00:58.010> charges<00:00:58.430> are

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
some of the negative charges are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.200 
some of the negative charges are
transferred<00:00:59.239> from<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.570> carpet<00:01:00.019> to<00:01:00.620> my<00:01:00.769> shoe

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
transferred from the carpet to my shoe

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.240 
transferred from the carpet to my shoe
the<00:01:02.210> negative<00:01:02.629> charges<00:01:03.080> appear<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.710> stay<00:01:03.920> put

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the negative charges appear to stay put

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.880 
the negative charges appear to stay put
on<00:01:04.460> my<00:01:04.729> shoe<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:05.690> my<00:01:06.020> shoes<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.380> made<00:01:06.710> out

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
on my shoe because my shoes are made out

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.550 
on my shoe because my shoes are made out
of<00:01:06.920> plastic<00:01:07.900> materials<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.050> behave<00:01:09.229> like

a negative charge on my body which

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.620 
a negative charge on my body which
suddenly<00:01:30.770> flows<00:01:31.220> when<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:31.759> touch<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.180> carpet

suddenly flows when I touch the carpet
sweeper<00:01:33.520> ouch<00:01:34.520> that's<00:01:35.509> because<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.440> made

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
sweeper ouch that's because it's made

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.940 
sweeper ouch that's because it's made
out<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:36.920> metal<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.610> conductor<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.950> conductor

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
out of metal a conductor a conductor

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.570 
out of metal a conductor a conductor
allows<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.520> electrical<00:01:41.119> charge<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.899> flow

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
allows the electrical charge to flow

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.850 
allows the electrical charge to flow
let's<00:01:43.580> take<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> look<00:01:44.119> at<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.420> again<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:45.650> I

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
let's take a look at that again as I

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.340 
let's take a look at that again as I
touched<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.490> sweeper<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.509> negative<00:01:47.960> charges

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
touched the sweeper the negative charges

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.710 
touched the sweeper the negative charges
flow<00:01:48.830> through<00:01:49.130> my<00:01:49.280> arm<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.759> down<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.420> metal

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
flow through my arm and down the metal

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.990 
flow through my arm and down the metal
handle<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:51.920> get<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.220> tiny<00:01:52.610> shock<00:01:53.500> ouch<00:01:55.000> this

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
handle so I get a tiny shock ouch this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.090 
handle so I get a tiny shock ouch this
helicopter<00:01:56.540> might<00:01:56.960> look<00:01:57.200> very<00:01:57.560> different<00:01:57.950> to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
helicopter might look very different to

helicopter might look very different to
my<00:01:58.250> shoes<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.390> very<00:01:59.869> similar<00:02:00.290> thing

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
my shoes but a very similar thing

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.100 
my shoes but a very similar thing
happens<00:02:01.159> here<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:02.030> are<00:02:02.240> going<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.630> investigate

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
happens here we are going to investigate

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.980 
happens here we are going to investigate
it<00:02:03.520> when<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.549> helicopter<00:02:05.210> flies<00:02:05.540> through<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
it when a helicopter flies through the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.350 
it when a helicopter flies through the

air dust particles in the air perhaps

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.120 
air dust particles in the air perhaps
off<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> blades<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.709> body<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.040> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the charge can't escape because the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.770 
the charge can't escape because the
