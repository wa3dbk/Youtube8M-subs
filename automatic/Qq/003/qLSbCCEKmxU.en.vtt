as<00:00:16.109> well<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.070> from<00:00:17.250> here<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.699> i'll

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
as well in it but from here on out i'll

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.599 
as well in it but from here on out i'll
be<00:00:18.150> using<00:00:18.330> xcode<00:00:18.960> four<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.590> anything<00:00:20.220> else

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
be using xcode four for anything else

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.029 
be using xcode four for anything else
that<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:20.789> add<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> series<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.470> later

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that i add to the series or a later

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.029 
that i add to the series or a later
version<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.609> xcode<00:00:23.850> whenever<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.510> comes<00:00:25.039> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
version of xcode whenever that comes so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
version of xcode whenever that comes so
anyway<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> tutorial<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
anyway the point of this tutorial is to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
anyway the point of this tutorial is to
show<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.130> how<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> use<00:00:29.519> code<00:00:30.119> snippets<00:00:30.599> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
show you how to use code snippets in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.560 
show you how to use code snippets in
xcode<00:00:31.019> four<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.669> this<00:00:32.669> should<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.059> available

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
xcode four and this should be available

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350 
xcode four and this should be available
for<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.320> versions<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.980> xcode<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.940> ran

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
for all versions of xcode for that ran

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
for all versions of xcode for that ran
on<00:00:36.390> snow<00:00:37.290> leopard<00:00:37.320> lion<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.879> point

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
on snow leopard lion and at this point

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.680 
on snow leopard lion and at this point
mountain<00:00:39.510> lion<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.620> anyway<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
mountain lion so anyway with that to get

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.440 
mountain lion so anyway with that to get
to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.469> code<00:00:43.890> snippets<00:00:44.399> library<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to the code snippets library you just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
to the code snippets library you just
have<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> hit<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> till<00:00:46.680> ities<00:00:46.890> bar<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
have to hit the till ities bar on the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
have to hit the till ities bar on the
right<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> bottom<00:00:49.500> section

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
right there and at the bottom section

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
right there and at the bottom section
you'll<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.260> curly

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you'll see that there are the curly

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
you'll see that there are the curly
braces<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
braces right there and that will get you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.369 
braces right there and that will get you
to<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.260> code<00:00:55.980> snippet<00:00:56.489> library<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:58.230> can

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to your code snippet library and you can

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.950 
to your code snippet library and you can
scroll<00:00:58.680> through<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.129> whole<00:00:59.340> library<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
scroll through this whole library of

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.880 
scroll through this whole library of
different<00:01:00.960> things<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different things and you can see that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
different things and you can see that
there's<00:01:02.250> tons<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.059> different<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.470> code

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
there's tons of different you know code

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
there's tons of different you know code
snippets<00:01:05.489> already<00:01:05.790> available<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> might

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
snippets already available now you might

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
snippets already available now you might
be<00:01:07.170> wondering<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> heck<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> code

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
be wondering what the heck is a code

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
be wondering what the heck is a code
snippet<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.869> basically<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> way

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
snippet well basically it's just a way

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
snippet well basically it's just a way
that<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.760> save<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.659> nice<00:01:13.229> chunk<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that you can save this nice chunk of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.539 
that you can save this nice chunk of
code<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.360> later<00:01:15.750> use<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.920> example<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.400> i

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
code for a later use so for example if i

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.510 
code for a later use so for example if i
look<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> do-while<00:01:18.900> statement<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
look at this do-while statement and just

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
look at this do-while statement and just
clicked<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
clicked on it there and you can see that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.230 
clicked on it there and you can see that
this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.100> do-while<00:01:23.400> statement<00:01:23.460> will

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this is what the do-while statement will

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570 
this is what the do-while statement will
give<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.530> wanted<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> use<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
give me and if i wanted to use this in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.929 
give me and if i wanted to use this in
my<00:01:26.700> code<00:01:27.000> i<00:01:27.299> could<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.900> drag<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
my code i could just drag this out and

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
my code i could just drag this out and
drop<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.390> project<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.799> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
drop in my project and you can see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.210 
drop in my project and you can see
that's<00:01:32.189> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:33.450> indent<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.650> indented

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that's kind of not indent not indented

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.370 
that's kind of not indent not indented
correctly<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.479> i<00:01:36.600> wanted<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> fix<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
correctly but if i wanted to fix this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.399 
correctly but if i wanted to fix this
all<00:01:37.619> I'd<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.490> hit<00:01:38.549> control<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
all I'd have to do is hit control I and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.249 
all I'd have to do is hit control I and
that<00:01:40.890> would<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.400> Lyrian<00:01:42.030> dent<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.840> what

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that would nice Lyrian dent it to what

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
that would nice Lyrian dent it to what
it<00:01:43.350> should<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> also

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it should be now you can see it also

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
it should be now you can see it also
gives<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> nice<00:01:46.110> tokens<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.159> can

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
gives you the nice tokens that you can

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
gives you the nice tokens that you can
you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.479> through<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.470> put

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you know kind of go through so I can put

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.560 
you know kind of go through so I can put
something<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.119> can't<00:01:51.329> add

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
something in there and then I can't add

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
something in there and then I can't add
to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> next<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> nice<00:01:53.520> neat

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to the next one so that's a nice neat

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
to the next one so that's a nice neat
little<00:01:54.390> thing<00:01:54.540> about<00:01:54.840> code<00:01:55.140> snippets<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
little thing about code snippets is that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
little thing about code snippets is that
you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.700> nicely<00:01:57.000> drag<00:01:57.509> them<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can just nicely drag them out to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.340 
you can just nicely drag them out to
your<00:01:58.920> code<00:01:59.360> now<00:02:00.360> another<00:02:00.689> thing<00:02:00.869> about<00:02:01.110> code

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
your code now another thing about code

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.200 
your code now another thing about code
snippets<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.520> sort<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
snippets is that you can have sort of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.499 
snippets is that you can have sort of
text<00:02:03.829> expansions<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:04.950> completions<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.820> each

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
text expansions or completions for each

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.559 
text expansions or completions for each
one<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:08.280> had<00:02:08.610> under<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
one so you can see they had under if I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.229 
one so you can see they had under if I
just<00:02:09.750> hit<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.410> while<00:02:10.790> code<00:02:11.790> snippet<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
just hit the do while code snippet here

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.900 
just hit the do while code snippet here
in<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
in it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.090 
in it
it<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.990> code<00:02:14.260> completion<00:02:14.740> or

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
it you can see the code completion or

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.610 
it you can see the code completion or
the<00:02:15.220> completion<00:02:15.670> shortcut<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.230> do-while

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the completion shortcut for the do-while

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.960 
the completion shortcut for the do-while
so<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.550> do-while<00:02:20.070> text<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.280> basically<00:02:21.760> going

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
so the do-while text is basically going

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.870 
so the do-while text is basically going
to<00:02:22.240> expand<00:02:23.230> into<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.310> whole<00:02:24.580> statement

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to expand into this whole statement

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.200 
to expand into this whole statement
right<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.320> just<00:02:26.590> did<00:02:26.770> do<00:02:27.400> while<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
right here so if I just did do while you

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.630 
right here so if I just did do while you
can<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.110> hit<00:02:29.320> return<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.430> would

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
can see that if I hit return it would

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.150 
can see that if I hit return it would
expand<00:02:31.180> into<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.870> whole<00:02:32.200> code<00:02:32.620> snippet

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
expand into that whole code snippet

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.000 
expand into that whole code snippet
that's<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:33.640> my<00:02:33.790> code<00:02:34.360> snippet<00:02:34.780> library<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.740> if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
that's in my code snippet library so if

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.530 
that's in my code snippet library so if
you<00:02:36.190> ever<00:02:36.370> want<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.760> know<00:02:36.940> all<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.420> different

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
you ever want to know all the different

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.110 
you ever want to know all the different
code<00:02:37.960> snippets<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.470> are<00:02:38.620> available<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.970> can

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
code snippets that are available you can

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.570 
code snippets that are available you can
just<00:02:40.360> glance<00:02:40.780> over<00:02:41.080> into<00:02:41.530> your<00:02:41.650> code<00:02:42.220> snippet

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
just glance over into your code snippet

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.220 
just glance over into your code snippet
library<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.600> know<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.900> through<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
library and just you know go through a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
library and just you know go through a
bunch<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.590> them<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.830> there's<00:02:44.980> some<00:02:45.190> fairly

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
bunch of them and there's some fairly

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.940 
bunch of them and there's some fairly
useful<00:02:46.090> ones<00:02:46.510> uh<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.800> know<00:02:47.830> really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
useful ones uh if you you know really

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
useful ones uh if you you know really
want<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> glance<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.510> them<00:02:49.660> there's<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.320> know

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
want to glance at them there's you know

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.640 
want to glance at them there's you know
the<00:02:50.590> init<00:02:50.890> method<00:02:50.920> they're<00:02:51.460> two<00:02:51.730> completely

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the init method they're two completely

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.350 
the init method they're two completely
autofill<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.680> init<00:02:54.400> method<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
autofill the init method for you and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.570 
autofill the init method for you and
there's<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:56.230> whole<00:02:56.470> bunch<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.010> others<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.310> you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
there's a whole bunch of others that you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.920 
there's a whole bunch of others that you
can<00:02:57.910> go<00:02:58.330> through<00:02:58.570> as<00:02:58.690> well<00:02:59.130> so<00:03:00.130> with<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
can go through as well so with that the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
can go through as well so with that the
coolest<00:03:02.350> part<00:03:02.560> though<00:03:02.740> about<00:03:03.070> code<00:03:03.400> snippets

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
coolest part though about code snippets

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.850 
coolest part though about code snippets
is<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.330> make<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.630> own<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.410> made

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
is that you can make your own so I made

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.620 
is that you can make your own so I made
a<00:03:06.100> little<00:03:06.370> one<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.760> I've<00:03:06.850> used<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.360> some<00:03:07.570> of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
a little one that I've used in some of

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.170 
a little one that I've used in some of
the<00:03:07.720> tutorials<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:09.250> basically<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.850> quick

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
the tutorials and it's basically a quick

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.050 
the tutorials and it's basically a quick
NS<00:03:10.600> log<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.320> if<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.920> drag<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.820> see

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
NS log and if I drag this in you can see

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.470 
NS log and if I drag this in you can see
that<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.480> just<00:03:13.780> gives<00:03:14.320> me<00:03:14.470> an<00:03:14.560> NS<00:03:14.800> log<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
that it just gives me an NS log but the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.300 
that it just gives me an NS log but the
cool<00:03:16.720> thing<00:03:16.750> about<00:03:17.020> this<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.680> i<00:03:18.070> also

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
cool thing about this is that i also

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.310 
cool thing about this is that i also
have<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:20.020> NS<00:03:20.830> log<00:03:21.100> attached<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.660> completion

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
have the NS log attached to a completion

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.860 
have the NS log attached to a completion
shortcut<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:24.010> when<00:03:24.130> i<00:03:24.160> hit<00:03:24.459> our<00:03:24.700> type<00:03:25.209> i<00:03:25.420> would

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
shortcut so when i hit our type i would

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.590 
shortcut so when i hit our type i would
type<00:03:26.230> log<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.890> will<00:03:27.160> actually<00:03:27.340> expand<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.209> this

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
type log it will actually expand to this

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.800 
type log it will actually expand to this
whole<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> slog<00:03:29.380> thing<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.370> see<00:03:30.550> here<00:03:30.810> so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
whole a slog thing that you see here so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.410 
whole a slog thing that you see here so
for<00:03:32.020> example<00:03:32.050> if<00:03:32.470> i<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.830> say<00:03:33.040> type<00:03:33.490> log<00:03:33.730> it

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
for example if i just say type log it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.180 
for example if i just say type log it
will<00:03:34.540> expand<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.410> my<00:03:35.620> end<00:03:35.800> this<00:03:35.890> log

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
will expand right to my end this log

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.760 
will expand right to my end this log
that<00:03:36.850> will<00:03:37.000> print<00:03:37.270> out<00:03:37.420> an<00:03:37.690> object<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.380> then

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
that will print out an object and then

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.350 
that will print out an object and then
you<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.070> also<00:03:39.220> see<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.610> i<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:40.000> even<00:03:40.150> get

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
you can also see that i can even get

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.140 
you can also see that i can even get
tokens<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:42.190> code<00:03:42.430> snippet<00:03:42.850> as<00:03:42.940> well

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
tokens to be in the code snippet as well

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.940 
tokens to be in the code snippet as well
which<00:03:43.360> means<00:03:43.600> i<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.900> quickly<00:03:44.050> tab<00:03:44.500> through

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
which means i can quickly tab through

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.400 
which means i can quickly tab through
any<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.880> tokens<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.480> want<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:47.050> the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
any of the tokens that I want in the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.830 
any of the tokens that I want in the
analog<00:03:47.890> it's<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.459> quicker<00:03:49.030> way<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.300> kind

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
analog it's just a quicker way to kind

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.530 
analog it's just a quicker way to kind
of<00:03:49.900> code<00:03:50.110> through<00:03:50.470> what<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.830> want<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.120> how<00:03:52.480> do

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
of code through what you want so how do

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.840 
of code through what you want so how do
you<00:03:52.690> create<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.260> code<00:03:53.650> snippet<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.310> I'm<00:03:54.730> just

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
you create a code snippet well I'm just

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.340 
you create a code snippet well I'm just
going<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.060> go<00:03:55.150> ahead<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.540> delete<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.200> one<00:03:56.320> I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
going to go ahead and delete the one I

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.830 
going to go ahead and delete the one I
have<00:03:56.680> here<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:58.080> delete<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.380> and<00:04:00.570> let's<00:04:01.570> say

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
have here and delete that and let's say

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.650 
have here and delete that and let's say
I<00:04:01.870> want<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.320> create<00:04:02.590> my<00:04:02.830> own<00:04:02.860> NS<00:04:03.459> log<00:04:03.760> for<00:04:04.360> my

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
I want to create my own NS log for my

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.770 
I want to create my own NS log for my
own<00:04:04.780> use<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:06.550> do<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.209> just<00:04:07.360> type

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
own use so to do this I can just type

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.080 
own use so to do this I can just type
whatever<00:04:07.989> text<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.709> want<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.070> eventually<00:04:09.670> put

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
whatever text I want to eventually put

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.610 
whatever text I want to eventually put
in<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.239> code<00:04:10.390> snippet<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:10.930> then<00:04:11.110> i<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.410> just

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
in the code snippet and then i can just

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.130 
in the code snippet and then i can just
later<00:04:11.920> drag<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.459> into<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.270> code<00:04:13.750> snippet

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
later drag it into the code snippet

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.710 
later drag it into the code snippet
library<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.860> if<00:04:15.370> i<00:04:15.550> want<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.000> make<00:04:16.120> an<00:04:16.270> NS<00:04:16.510> log

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
library so if i want to make an NS log

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.080 
library so if i want to make an NS log
just<00:04:17.109> print<00:04:17.470> out<00:04:17.560> an<00:04:17.770> object<00:04:18.250> that's<00:04:18.820> a

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
just print out an object that's a

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.080 
just print out an object that's a
percent<00:04:19.510> at<00:04:19.690> sign<00:04:19.750> and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
percent at sign and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.600 
percent at sign and
then<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.139> nice<00:04:22.290> little<00:04:22.620> token<00:04:23.070> you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
then to get the nice little token you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.970 
then to get the nice little token you
just<00:04:23.850> kind<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.360> create<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:25.199> little<00:04:25.530> syntax

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
just kind of create this little syntax

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.430 
just kind of create this little syntax
to<00:04:26.220> create<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:26.790> tokens<00:04:27.180> which<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.750> lesson

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
to create the tokens which is the lesson

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.860 
to create the tokens which is the lesson
side<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.250> then<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.610> number<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.150> then<00:04:30.720> you'll

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
side and then the number and then you'll

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
side and then the number and then you'll
finish<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.350> off<00:04:31.470> with<00:04:31.500> another<00:04:31.919> number<00:04:32.669> and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
finish it off with another number and

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.600 
finish it off with another number and
then<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.210> greater<00:04:33.479> than<00:04:33.720> or<00:04:33.900> other<00:04:34.139> sign<00:04:34.830> so

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
then the greater than or other sign so

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.659 
then the greater than or other sign so
basically<00:04:36.210> if<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.750> want<00:04:37.070> let's<00:04:38.070> just<00:04:38.190> say<00:04:38.370> i'll

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
basically if I want let's just say i'll

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.870 
basically if I want let's just say i'll
put<00:04:39.000> some<00:04:39.180> object<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.400> then<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.580> finish<00:04:41.699> it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
put some object and then to finish it

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.460 
put some object and then to finish it
off<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.240> just<00:04:42.270> do<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.660> number<00:04:42.930> sign<00:04:43.139> again

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
off you just do the number sign again

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.980 
off you just do the number sign again
and<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.160> closing<00:04:44.699> greater<00:04:45.630> than<00:04:45.840> or

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
and with the closing greater than or

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.379 
and with the closing greater than or
less<00:04:46.020> than<00:04:46.169> sign<00:04:46.590> whatever<00:04:47.010> those<00:04:47.970> are<00:04:48.000> called

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
less than sign whatever those are called

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.050 
less than sign whatever those are called
so<00:04:49.050> when<00:04:49.410> that's<00:04:49.620> done<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:50.070> can<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:50.550> end<00:04:50.850> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
so when that's done I can just end it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.810 
so when that's done I can just end it
like<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:52.410> would<00:04:52.560> finish<00:04:52.800> off<00:04:53.100> my<00:04:53.430> s

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
like that and that would finish off my s

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.230 
like that and that would finish off my s
log<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.110> if<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.530> want<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.770> put<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:56.070> now<00:04:56.310> into<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
log so if I want to put this now into a

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.800 
log so if I want to put this now into a
code<00:04:57.660> snippet<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.290> can<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.740> add<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.729> can<00:05:00.660> just

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
code snippet I can just add I can just

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.930 
code snippet I can just add I can just
leave<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.139> like<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.260> drag<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.400> over<00:05:02.580> into

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
leave it like this drag this over into

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.210 
leave it like this drag this over into
the<00:05:02.970> code<00:05:03.270> snippet<00:05:03.660> library<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.710> drop<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.100> in

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
the code snippet library and drop it in

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.070 
the code snippet library and drop it in
and<00:05:05.370> then<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.300> see<00:05:06.510> that<00:05:06.720> at<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.930> bottom

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
and then you can see that at the bottom

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.100 
and then you can see that at the bottom
here<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.590> get<00:05:07.950> my<00:05:08.250> code<00:05:08.550> snippet<00:05:08.970> now<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.930> want

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
here I get my code snippet now if I want

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
right here it has a nice little code

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.629 
right here it has a nice little code
token<00:05:30.660> for<00:05:30.960> me<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.770> i<00:05:31.800> can<00:05:31.919> quickly<00:05:32.190> jump

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
token for me so that i can quickly jump

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.170 
token for me so that i can quickly jump
to<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.510> some<00:05:34.020> object<00:05:34.470> placeholder<00:05:35.100> so<00:05:36.000> i'll

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
to that some object placeholder so i'll

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.990 
to that some object placeholder so i'll
just<00:05:36.210> hit<00:05:36.479> done<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:38.070> now<00:05:38.310> if<00:05:38.580> I<00:05:38.760> want

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
just hit done on that and now if I want

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.210 
just hit done on that and now if I want
to<00:05:39.090> use<00:05:39.300> my<00:05:39.330> type<00:05:40.080> log<00:05:40.289> command<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.919> just<00:05:41.099> have

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
to use my type log command I just have

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.610 
to use my type log command I just have
to<00:05:41.340> hit<00:05:41.460> type<00:05:41.729> log<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.300> as<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.050> can<00:05:43.169> see<00:05:43.200> it

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
to hit type log and as you can see it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.159 
to hit type log and as you can see it
will<00:05:43.710> expand<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.880> code<00:05:45.450> snippet<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.050> I

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
will expand to that code snippet and I

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.510 
will expand to that code snippet and I
just<00:05:46.410> have<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.650> put<00:05:46.860> in<00:05:46.979> some<00:05:47.220> object<00:05:47.940> and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
just have to put in some object and

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.460 
just have to put in some object and
there<00:05:50.520> we<00:05:50.639> go<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:51.570> that's<00:05:51.780> all<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:51.960> have<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.320> do

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
there we go so that's all I have to do

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.129 
there we go so that's all I have to do
to<00:05:52.500> use<00:05:53.310> code<00:05:53.610> snippets<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.240> i<00:05:54.690> highly

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
to use code snippets and i highly

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.980 
to use code snippets and i highly
suggest<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.860> try<00:05:56.669> it<00:05:56.729> out<00:05:56.849> for<00:05:57.000> yourself<00:05:57.060> it's

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
suggest you try it out for yourself it's

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.960 
suggest you try it out for yourself it's
a<00:05:58.050> pretty<00:05:58.260> neat<00:05:58.500> feature<00:05:58.770> in<00:05:59.070> xcode<00:05:59.430> four<00:05:59.700> and

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
a pretty neat feature in xcode four and

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.520 
a pretty neat feature in xcode four and
um<00:06:00.810> just<00:06:01.349> for<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.789> probably<00:06:03.150> the<00:06:03.210> most<00:06:03.389> useful

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
um just for the probably the most useful

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.010 
um just for the probably the most useful
part<00:06:04.530> is<00:06:04.650> that<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:04.800> can<00:06:05.039> add<00:06:05.250> those<00:06:05.700> nice

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
part is that you can add those nice

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.230 
part is that you can add those nice
completion<00:06:07.020> shortcuts<00:06:07.560> with<00:06:07.910> just<00:06:08.910> by<00:06:09.030> typing

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
completion shortcuts with just by typing

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.870 
completion shortcuts with just by typing
whatever<00:06:09.720> you<00:06:09.870> want<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.830> get<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.729> whole

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
whatever you want and you get the whole

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.960 
whatever you want and you get the whole
code<00:06:12.599> completion<00:06:12.990> or<00:06:13.320> code<00:06:13.740> snippet<00:06:14.160> so

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
code completion or code snippet so

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.300 
code completion or code snippet so
anyway<00:06:15.389> yeah<00:06:16.260> just<00:06:16.590> try<00:06:16.800> it<00:06:16.830> out<00:06:17.039> for<00:06:17.250> yourself

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
anyway yeah just try it out for yourself

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.219 
anyway yeah just try it out for yourself
and<00:06:17.940> if<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.330> have<00:06:18.419> any<00:06:18.450> questions<00:06:18.960> about<00:06:19.110> it

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
and if you have any questions about it

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.170 
and if you have any questions about it

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
just leave in the comments below but I

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.839 
just leave in the comments below but I
think<00:06:21.479> it's<00:06:21.599> pretty<00:06:21.810> self-explanatory

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
think it's pretty self-explanatory

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.600 
think it's pretty self-explanatory
