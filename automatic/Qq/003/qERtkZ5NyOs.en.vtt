00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi captains welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.370
 video of your questions two no no 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 we have an acronym not yet anyway 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.410
 today we will never tell you we will explain 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.450
 how to install the jap version of the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 one piece touchwiz game on a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.330
 android device 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 any android device is fine 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 but must have enabled 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 to the installation of applications 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.760
 outside the store 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.580
 the first thing to do is to open yours 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 nice browser and try going on this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.030
 site apk point q dash up.com a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.090
 once done this you will go to download 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.920
 this cute little free program e 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.300
 sure no life no problem is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 an alternative to the store 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 in short, it also allows you to download 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.649
 up that have not been localized 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 widespread in our country but above all 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.300
 in asia 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.090
 once downloaded this application 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 we will install once 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.129
 installed the application will allow us 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.640
 through a special menu to search 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.820
 one piece thatcher cruise is to download it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.619
 now you will have noticed that the interface 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 slightly different because I use 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.340
 an ipad to play usually for 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.929
 record though 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 since this guide was for users 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.969
 android I had to make an emulator 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.679
 in short, but it can be very well done 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.439
 from your mobile without any 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:32.250
 problem we will download the first one 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.520
 version 3.0.1 here will not be there 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 never problems with regards to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 update the game because from 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.060
 club team makes all the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.829
 applications are always up to date 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.219
 to the latest version released and this 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.630
 it's a good thing 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.489
 will now make a small check on the login e 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.380
 start downloading the game once 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.469
 who will have downloaded the game from here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.829
 you will only need to install and you will have 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.140
 a surplus jap track on your account 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.200
 I don't recommend playing this anyway 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.259
 version of the game for the simple 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.900
 reason that preferring the global for one 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.340
 language question 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.099
 I prefer to understand something but not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.079
 ruining the surprises too much is that 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.400
 that will happen then I remember that the 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:26.459
 Japanese version of the game is about 7 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.370
 8 months later than ours 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.440
 but all or almost all the features that are there 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.819
 in the jap version there will be the global 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.180
 so at your discretion it can be 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.590
 available 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.930
 simply also on our phone 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.660
 I greet you and refer you to the next 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.049
 video that should be or a tutorial 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.389
 on this for our shopper or a lot 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.430
 probably with those then stay 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.080
 on the channel subscribe like if it is 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.630
 evident 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.430
 everything is told to everyone 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.230
 pleasure a cool one piece game 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.780
 for mobile phones 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.780
