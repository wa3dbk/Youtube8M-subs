00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
pages the night before I've done this in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
pages the night before I've done this in
college<00:02:07.560> too<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.069> very<00:02:08.310> bad<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.030> know

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
college too and it's very bad you know

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.280 
college too and it's very bad you know
what<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.720> worth<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
what it's worth it

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.080 
what it's worth it
I<00:02:11.319> find<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.739> it's<00:02:11.950> definitely<00:02:12.189> worth<00:02:12.579> it<00:02:12.760> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
