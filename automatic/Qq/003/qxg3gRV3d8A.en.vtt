00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.680 
would have to be free for all just
because<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.030> many<00:02:16.120> people<00:02:16.450> are<00:02:16.510> running

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
because so many people are running

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
because so many people are running
around<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.470> lot<00:02:17.620> easier<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.010> find<00:02:18.280> like

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
around so it's a lot easier to find like

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.520 
around so it's a lot easier to find like
opponents<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.629> kill<00:02:19.840> because<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.260> know<00:02:20.319> what<00:02:20.500> I

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
on my team like enemies it'll just be

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.180 
on my team like enemies it'll just be
slick<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.720> complicated<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.590> unless<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.040> have

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
slick so complicated like unless I have

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.059 
slick so complicated like unless I have
a<00:02:30.220> UAV<00:02:30.670> or<00:02:30.940> something<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:32.140> cannot<00:02:33.010> find

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
a UAV or something I just cannot find

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.280 
a UAV or something I just cannot find
anybody<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.120> struggle<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.720> think<00:02:35.140> my

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
anybody and it's the struggle I think my

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.930 
anybody and it's the struggle I think my
weirdest<00:02:35.620> experience<00:02:35.920> would<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
weirdest experience would have to be

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.080 
weirdest experience would have to be
having<00:02:37.269> catfishes<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.170> milk<00:02:39.040> made<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.549> me<00:02:39.790> like

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
having catfishes of milk made of me like

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.479 
having catfishes of milk made of me like
I<00:02:40.269> just<00:02:40.329> think<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.049> uncomfortable<00:02:41.530> but

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
I just think it's so uncomfortable but

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.059 
I just think it's so uncomfortable but
like<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:42.849> bound<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.569> happen<00:02:43.829> obviously<00:02:44.829> but

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
like it's bound to happen obviously but

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.190 
like it's bound to happen obviously but
it's<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> fact<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.090> someone<00:02:46.989> can

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
it's just like the fact that someone can

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.319 
it's just like the fact that someone can
just<00:02:47.410> take<00:02:48.069> my<00:02:48.190> pictures<00:02:48.519> from<00:02:48.700> anywhere<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
just take my pictures from anywhere and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.110 
just take my pictures from anywhere and
just<00:02:49.440> pretend<00:02:50.440> through<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.310> really

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
just pretend through me it just really

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.910 
just pretend through me it just really
just<00:02:52.209> give<00:02:52.390> me<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> weird<00:02:52.870> feeling<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.379> I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
just give me a weird feeling like I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920 
just give me a weird feeling like I
don't<00:02:54.489> know<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.910> makes<00:02:55.060> me<00:02:55.180> uncomfortable<00:02:55.599> but

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
don't know it makes me uncomfortable but

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.839 
don't know it makes me uncomfortable but
at<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.140> same<00:02:56.290> time<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.560> can't<00:02:56.860> stop<00:02:57.129> it<00:02:57.340> I've
