00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and I was going up the stairs and I shot

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
and I was going up the stairs and I shot
this<00:02:01.320> guy<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.799> square<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> chest<00:02:02.790> with

this guy right square in the chest with
a<00:02:03.299> rocket<00:02:03.570> launcher<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.229> how<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
a rocket launcher I don't know how it
didn't<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.159> make<00:02:05.369> an<00:02:05.460> explosion<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
didn't like make an explosion but I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.710 
didn't like make an explosion but I
guess<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.740> why<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.369> made<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> beta<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
guess that's why they made a beta and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.809 
guess that's why they made a beta and
this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> new<00:02:10.349> thing<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.129> flashlight

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819

you<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.170> guess<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.409> really<00:02:18.650> good<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> use

if<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.150> are<00:02:20.239> using<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.719> against<00:02:21.019> other<00:02:21.109> people

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
if you are using it against other people

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.080 
if you are using it against other people
even<00:02:21.890> though<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.250> doesn't<00:02:22.370> seem<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.790> it's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
even though it doesn't seem like it's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.209 
even though it doesn't seem like it's
doing<00:02:23.269> much<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.959> them<00:02:24.230> you're<00:02:24.530> blinding<00:02:25.099> the
