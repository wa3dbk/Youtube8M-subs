dull<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.369> faster<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:33.810> they're

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
dull a little faster but because they're

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.450 
dull a little faster but because they're
they're<00:01:34.259> even<00:01:34.710> composition<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.369> they're

they're even composition and they're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
they're even composition and they're
easier<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> sharpen<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.920> they're<00:01:37.920> less

single edge and this knife here is a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
single edge and this knife here is a
good<00:01:44.280> example<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> blade

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
good example of it you can see the blade

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
good example of it you can see the blade
edge<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.310> side<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> nothing

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
edge is all on this one side and nothing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
edge is all on this one side and nothing
on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> other<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.530> makes<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> thinner

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
on the other it makes for a thinner

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
on the other it makes for a thinner
blade<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> less<00:01:51.780> damaging<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> food

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
blade that is a less damaging to food

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
blade that is a less damaging to food
but<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.880> fragile<00:01:54.500> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
but it's also a little more fragile the
