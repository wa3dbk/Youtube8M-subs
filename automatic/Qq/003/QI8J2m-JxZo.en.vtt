00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
of this a big deal the reason why it's a

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.439 
of this a big deal the reason why it's a
big<00:00:41.829> deal<00:00:42.039> is<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.340> we<00:00:42.610> don't<00:00:42.879> have<00:00:43.180> cable

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
big deal is that we don't have cable

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.150 
big deal is that we don't have cable
we're<00:00:44.050> doing<00:00:44.289> all<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.800> with<00:00:45.010> an

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
we're doing all of this with an

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.310 
we're doing all of this with an
over-the-air<00:00:45.670> antenna<00:00:46.059> we're<00:00:46.899> gonna<00:00:47.079> take<00:00:47.289> a

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
over-the-air antenna we're gonna take a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.590 
over-the-air antenna we're gonna take a
look<00:00:47.500> from<00:00:47.680> HD<00:00:48.280> frequency<00:00:48.969> it's<00:00:49.239> called<00:00:49.510> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
look from HD frequency it's called the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.959 
look from HD frequency it's called the
cable<00:00:50.050> cutter<00:00:50.350> area<00:00:50.949> wave<00:00:51.190> let's<00:00:51.699> take<00:00:51.940> a

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
cable cutter area wave let's take a

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.119 
cable cutter area wave let's take a
closer<00:00:52.329> look<00:00:52.449> so<00:00:53.020> here<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.739> cable

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
closer look so here it is the cable

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.400 
closer look so here it is the cable
cutter<00:00:54.399> area<00:00:54.820> wave<00:00:55.120> not<00:00:55.719> much<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.140> look<00:00:56.260> at

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
cutter area wave not much to look at

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.950 
cutter area wave not much to look at
because<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.039> small<00:00:57.430> light<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.059> thin<00:00:58.390> no

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
because it's so small light and thin no

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.080 
because it's so small light and thin no
AC<00:00:59.199> power<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.949> is<00:01:00.070> not<00:01:00.190> amplified<00:01:00.730> all<00:01:00.940> you

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
AC power this is not amplified all you

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.669 
AC power this is not amplified all you
have<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.359> coaxial<00:01:01.899> cable<00:01:01.929> hook<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.500> up<00:01:02.590> to

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
have is a coaxial cable hook it up to

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.529 
have is a coaxial cable hook it up to
your<00:01:02.739> TV<00:01:02.949> so<00:01:03.219> super<00:01:03.670> simple<00:01:04.000> super<00:01:04.210> light

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
your TV so super simple super light

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.540 
your TV so super simple super light
probably<00:01:04.839> weighs<00:01:05.080> about<00:01:05.289> six<00:01:05.710> seven<00:01:06.009> ounces<00:01:06.369> I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
probably weighs about six seven ounces I

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.430 
probably weighs about six seven ounces I
mean<00:01:06.910> look<00:01:07.060> how<00:01:07.090> thin<00:01:07.479> this<00:01:07.660> thing<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:08.020> into

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
mean look how thin this thing is into

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.620 
mean look how thin this thing is into
our<00:01:08.530> antenna<00:01:08.860> picks<00:01:09.130> up<00:01:09.340> HDTV<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.420> picks

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
our antenna picks up HDTV and it picks

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.199 
our antenna picks up HDTV and it picks
it<00:01:10.690> up<00:01:10.810> really<00:01:11.110> well<00:01:11.289> set<00:01:11.950> up<00:01:11.979> three<00:01:12.520> steps<00:01:12.820> but

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
it up really well set up three steps but

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.669 
it up really well set up three steps but
it's<00:01:13.390> really<00:01:13.569> as<00:01:13.840> simple<00:01:13.929> as<00:01:14.229> maybe<00:01:14.440> we'll

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
it's really as simple as maybe we'll

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.279 
it's really as simple as maybe we'll
only<00:01:14.860> one<00:01:15.130> step<00:01:15.429> two<00:01:15.819> steps<00:01:16.090> at<00:01:16.240> most<00:01:16.569> you

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
only one step two steps at most you

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.290 
only one step two steps at most you
attach<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.830> coaxial<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.789> antenna<00:01:19.149> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
attach the coaxial to the antenna and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.120 
attach the coaxial to the antenna and
then<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.630> back<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.929> your<00:01:19.990> TV<00:01:20.289> you<00:01:20.470> can<00:01:21.009> put

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
then to the back of your TV you can put

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430 
then to the back of your TV you can put
these<00:01:21.220> little<00:01:21.459> sticker<00:01:22.420> dots<00:01:22.720> on<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.170> stick

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
these little sticker dots on it to stick

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.020 
these little sticker dots on it to stick
it<00:01:23.590> someplace<00:01:23.770> we<00:01:24.160> didn't<00:01:24.489> we<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.729> propped

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it someplace we didn't we just propped

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.180 
it someplace we didn't we just propped
it<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.239> and<00:01:25.479> then<00:01:25.989> the<00:01:26.140> third<00:01:26.349> step<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:27.069> do

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
it up and then the third step is you do

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.550 
it up and then the third step is you do
a<00:01:27.220> scan<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.940> see<00:01:28.119> what<00:01:28.509> HD<00:01:28.989> channels<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.500> can

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
a scan to see what HD channels you can

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.320 
a scan to see what HD channels you can
pick<00:01:29.830> up<00:01:29.860> over-the-air<00:01:30.489> so<00:01:31.000> let's<00:01:31.119> take<00:01:31.300> a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
pick up over-the-air so let's take a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.969 
pick up over-the-air so let's take a
look<00:01:31.479> at<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.720> scan<00:01:32.080> looking<00:01:32.470> at<00:01:32.619> here<00:01:32.830> what

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
look at that scan looking at here what

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.229 
look at that scan looking at here what
we<00:01:33.099> picked<00:01:33.340> up<00:01:33.459> we<00:01:33.610> got<00:01:33.759> all<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.090> major

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.239 
we picked up we got all the major

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.089 
we picked up we got all the major
networks<00:01:34.750> there's<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.349> lot<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:35.649> other<00:01:35.800> things

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
networks there's a lot of other things

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.620

and<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.799> could<00:03:29.919> pull<00:03:30.129> in<00:03:30.280> off<00:03:30.549> the

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
and what you could pull in off the

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.460 
and what you could pull in off the
airwaves<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.239> HD<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:31.840> that's<00:03:32.019> cool<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.440> should

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
we were really impressed with it we've

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.170 
we were really impressed with it we've
tested<00:04:14.859> a<00:04:15.069> couple<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.430> different<00:04:15.729> antennas

up put in a whole bunch of channels
