00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.730
 It is strange to see this kind of roe 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 horror nowadays and this premiered 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.840
 until recently so taking advantage of that 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.160
 it's halloween I'll finally be able to see 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 a series of horror works that do not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.360
 have nothing to do with the mod 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.360
 I have moto nor having 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.910
 but the whore who gave birth to him was too 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.290
 ask that in a series of savings there is no 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.290
 a bitch, little sister 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.660
 and I am a curse and the warren of 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.880
 a school is cast by spirits 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.340
 vengeful thirsting blood for anger 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.100
 of a spectrum today I present the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.830
 review of poly cabbages 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.270
 south coast guard and the adaptation of a 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.040
 Japanese game that came out the season 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.140
 passed over a school full of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.699
 psychopathic ghosts with a bunch of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.530
 character more flat than a plain and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.270
 with your typical horror story that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.040
 tells the story of a super group 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.080
 friends who decide to cast a spell 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 friendship to always be together in the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.729
 that accidentally conjures up in a 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.380
 curse and as a result they fall into 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.780
 a school from which the closest the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.400
 tipa del hoop and very spiteful will try 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 of killing our characters and the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.330
 that they are going to have to try to survive 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.190
 in a rather hostile environment what 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.350
 curious is that it is based on a game 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.720
 of the year 97 and shortly after 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.910
 They released the film the rain in japan 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.920
 maybe the subject has already based the design 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.899
 of the character in the ring type and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.979
 made the theme of the open and also has 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.979
 something to do with a hoop 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 of course that falling when dealing with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 a school full of ghost 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 psychopath everywhere normal 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.049
 it would be that the characters back for 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.670
 solve the mystery exorcise them or 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.619
 give him some kind of eternal rest to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.600
 return to the normal world all healthy and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.000
 saved after all of that is about 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.470
 the game and if it is not so much the case here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.539
 that instead of doing it in a style of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.979
 typical persecution will not fall raising the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.539
 feeling of danger and resolving 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 many of the riddles turning into 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.500
 the school in a huge and diverse place 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.690
 for exploring his director he had the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.220
 incredible idea to focus on a 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.140
 experience of death and desecration 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.660
 reducing the amount of scenarios and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.069
 possible details without mentioning that for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.959
 the amount of elements in the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.959
 game have adapted it to four casualties 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.030
 it was abysmally compressed and as 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.010
 consequence several things are lost in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.569
 the process the investigations in the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.430
 broad school that were part of the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.680
 intense journey of the characters and their 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 personality because beyond the arc 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.500
 equipment and if you want I showed you in 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.390
 a flashback about the past of the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.880
 characters to sympathize more with them 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.280
 things that end up giving the same if the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.720
 they ended up killing and now that he touched the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.519
 subject of the people who had said it 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 at first that people who are 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.810
 re plans and are summarized in 3 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.610
 four words six with the best friend 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.319
 of naomi naomi in the best friend of 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 sayco and is in love with the protagonist 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.580
 because you are kind you have the teacher 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.260
 protective if you do not know that the puffed up that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.810
 is in love with the protagonist because 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.970
 kind the tender and sweet sisters 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.440
 they have all the demolished first in 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.750
 subject that has face to die too 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.269
 the bad deep although inside it is very 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.239
 kind and finally satoshi that has 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.920
 personality problems for example to 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.709
 principle I come that the subject is a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.750
 fucking shit and eye I would also be 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.190
 shit if I fall in the middle of a school 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.319
 that is full of corpses and ghosts 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.090
 psychopaths trying to kill me one 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.750
 serious normal reaction for example as 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 Naomi's 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.060
 but it happens and it turns out that the subject does not 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.060
 he seems to know 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 that is, the subject is going down a 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.310
 staircase full of corpses and go to 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.849
 ghost of a girl and that is the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.849
 reaction 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.790
 not for what I see not on the subject of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.740
 production was pretty good at 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.630
 comparison of what they did in looks and 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.740
 nicky the level of detail of the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.390
 people that is still pretty 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.220
 simple yet but the background art is 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.900
 detailed the soundtrack follows the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.420
 style of the game setting it in a way 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.130
 very gloomy the comparison of dan 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.410
 they won for here there was no pérez 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.670
 audiovisual and it's not because such merit 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.080
 but that could not be a good 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.270
 scenography and so on when the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.040
 budget that could be allocated to three 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.380
 episode they sent him to four or you're going 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.450
 having juicier resources the 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.850
 problem is that that made it end 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.380
 very linear and is summarized and ximo by 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.690
 the time constraints when having to 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.070
 reset all those four eggs there's no 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.870
 Scenes pool there but 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.370
 aida equipment there is no past of the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.840
 characters and leave nothing memorable 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.450
 causing it to be lost in oblivion 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.100
 along with many other series what yes 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.200
 I appreciate is that the ovas if not that 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.290
 it's not dense like in the game that is 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.810
 unbearable he spends his time leaving 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.730
 complaining and crying but ultimately 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.350
 It was not what I expected and I said in a 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.360
 principle that I would have preferred it to 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.580
 will focus more on exploring the whole school 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.350
 because the air of frightening showing you 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.110
 every three minutes guts and innards is 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.210
 hard 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.560
 and that has leaned to the worst 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.000
 game options that take you to all 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.830
 the bad endings had and for having 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.390
 It makes you end up importing three 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.790
 fuck the characters are going to 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.860
 die and for the end everything ends 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.130
 bad the casting of voices remained 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.780
 regarding the game that is very 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:19.030
 known for example the seal of his life 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.030
 that made the voice of rain the one of giúdici 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.250
 you would like to have a little sister 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.790
 and among other voices we have a queen and 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.930
 I'll house my house in the same number and tola 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.930
 epic of other series 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.100
 and how to forget about the classic scene of 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.980
 fan services being the lahoud point 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.930
 ecosport and I did not like me 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.740
 particularly the gor I do not like to 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.740
 nothing and 99 99 9% of the adaptations 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.480
 of the games are usually very bad and 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.090
 note everywhere that this is done 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.190
 On request, what I do recommend is that 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.870
 play it I particularly played it and 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.520
 as a person from the old what can I 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.009
 say that it is very 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.330
 his style is where the music is 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.430
 engaging and the school is a place 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.440
 huge and explorable from which you're going to 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.629
 be a good time looking for things the 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.979
 difficulty is not that high but having 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.470
 occasions from which you will die for 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.270
 cause of trial and error and what were you looking for 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.430
 a series of horror and much more fear 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.810
 then you will not be able to sleep and you're going to 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.950
 contemplate suicide when you see the 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.270
 keiko movies 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.040
 Indian 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.610
 best of May each with the series of 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.610
 blackrock 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.550
 ah 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.180
 already cut 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.080
 and
