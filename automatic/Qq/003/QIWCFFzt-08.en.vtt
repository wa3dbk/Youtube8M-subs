 he had been feeling better and better 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 as a comparison by brightsource 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.780

 at wall street 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 we will see here 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 video capsules it's a sign of weakness 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 the trend is down 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.010
 I do not know if we come back to the public at the level of the colors it remains very 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.720
 very well 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.780
 on stage the characters and its thousands of euros of debt

 it's something pretty 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 pretty impressive 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.830
 the little novelty but one thing is sure if so right now 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.010
 the site the gold cross 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.640
 remote control 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 it's still a lot 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.670
 c afp something easy 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.930

 the team of mauges 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.519
 Sunday - which limits a little less than five simple dishes that had lined up a 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.079
 micro and disseminates meaning 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.079
 holder with telly these rules provide 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.279
 we find exactly the same thing 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.249
 we had taken the advantage 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.909
 the 26 year old pilot 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.799
 from the TV remote control 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.859
 and I drop appreciable 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.099

 we will show that the club fadoq obama 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 but at the point of the draw 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.799
 we thought lost 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.239
 as for the same source 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 all with lucidity vis-a-vis the Swiss 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.839
 it is necessary for example when we will get back Jean Charest at the university 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.329
 exactly the same 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.619
 for having changed at once 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.619

 brammertz that you like done ticking on the hip succeeded to 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.939
 find necessarily 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 we have video links and xstrata 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.109
 strengthening the wireless internet connection 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.729
