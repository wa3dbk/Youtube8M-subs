00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
origami and this particular one like I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.699 
origami and this particular one like I
said<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.399> in<00:01:29.579> 2005<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.439> price<00:01:31.469> for

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
said was in 2005 the going price for

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:33.620 
said was in 2005 the going price for
this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.219> thousand<00:01:32.729> two<00:01:32.880> hundred<00:01:32.909> yen<00:01:33.389> but

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this is a thousand two hundred yen but

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
this is a thousand two hundred yen but
because<00:01:34.139> it<00:01:34.289> is<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.619> old<00:01:34.859> you<00:01:35.399> might

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because it is a little old you might

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.099 
because it is a little old you might
only<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.819> able<00:01:35.969> to<00:01:36.060> find<00:01:36.270> used<00:01:36.509> copies<00:01:36.959> and

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
only be able to find used copies and

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.330 
only be able to find used copies and
those<00:01:37.259> might<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.859> more<00:01:38.039> expensive

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
those might only be more expensive

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
those might only be more expensive
rather<00:01:38.729> than<00:01:38.969> cheaper<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.929> for<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
rather than cheaper because it is for a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.459 
rather than cheaper because it is for a
little<00:01:40.679> old<00:01:40.859> now<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.959> like<00:01:42.959> I<00:01:43.020> said<00:01:43.289> the

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
little old now but like I said the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.190 
little old now but like I said the
general<00:01:44.310> idea<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.939> gist<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> him<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> what

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
general idea that gist of him and what

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.219 
general idea that gist of him and what
he<00:01:46.319> does<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.859> all<00:01:47.279> here<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.840> some

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
he does is all here but there are some
