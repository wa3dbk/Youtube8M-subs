00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.290
 because they knew it shows this time 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.469
 well Kenneth Klev of MainFirst but he in the pre - program simply Dr 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.670
 Listen and see and be amazed 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.949
 our policemen about the percent 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 Year new covers from May come into force 86 from 6 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.359
 I'm killing myself out for finance 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.289
 one stop after the update hopefully comes in late September 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.510
 yes, meant by Mojang 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.910
 I have it too and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.270
 Actually, I've already thought it's coming today 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.079
 28 percent or 29 10 August but at least 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660
 unfortunately nothing came of it 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.730
 it hardly comes until the end of September here he says and she must show what 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 is because so new second there are in the year around 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.040
 and on 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.340
 Villis Meran is targeted 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.140
 Hunger ad on 9 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.310
 Percent so far still a bonus of 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.100
 May come into force 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 m say Jens Hegeler and measures 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.640
 Do you know what else eat percent you lose hearts again so speak 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.220
 do you have 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 Rome 18 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.760
 like a normal guy 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.840
 then Zion sees this tanned the Rhineland calms down 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.290
 of monsters anyway 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.930
 a very interesting and beautiful yes then you can definitely percent new 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.649
 Learn tricks or sprinter one for example 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.889
 you could see the key w pressed that you just percent off 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.240
 earlier in the sprint 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 um, if I'm so interesting 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.890
 yes then we have just percent 9th the app is the most constant 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 which these tests are populated 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.230
 yes and they are not generated that means if you're lucky and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.850
 Neckar Percent has claimed the probable lot 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.790
 on the map 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.350
 and you read a tip you can negotiate with them 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.340
 Percent and they'll probably be percent smaller as well 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.420
 Quests did not exist 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 give up while moan bring ten eggs and we are friends here I give you 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.400
 then go for that and the percent article or as Mr 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.879
 So that's quite interesting for me that's not cool 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.199
 the evil attracts more and more to play a cohabitation role 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.339
 what the government a boss change 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.769
 and percent years then they have here 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.679
 the next innovation to the bow 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.829
 The bow can be down to 1 point 8 percent 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.429
 Percent year Spain and so to speak percent critical hits Erlangen 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.429
 Price on animals shoot at that time Survey of our 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.659
 one can practically train him the older ones of the peace to entries little 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.240
 say 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.609
 on the opponent 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.669
 and then let go of the mouse button 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.709
 Dieter Frey already off 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.239
 Every day made cool I'm curious how it's percent that 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.450
 Game mechanics because everything is so percent and so no idea 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.279
 I'm definitely looking forward to it 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.429
 Percent of the moreover there is the credit must be office not particularly of 8 and 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:14.359
 So you could tell the dairy farmer you can say I said it was all 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.509
 decided 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.579
 but just 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.310
 Concrete preference then we give them the Novus fabric for each material easy 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:26.169
 so you can fly by putting it twice 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.629
 because I read 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.769
 and we depend, for example, the mode is only there just to Hetty like 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 Let Kate go and build what you really want 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:40.609
 the good thing is that no monsters and there are like Twitter and zombies and 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.089
 what can break 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:47.259
 so really no earnings foot let yourself get kicked out of it all 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.649
 possible what you want that is defeatism there 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:51.859
 the 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.409
 here were 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.129
 I always want to have said that I believe the prayer has people who IG 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.289
 the big wait 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.549
 and around 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.719
 the trains are so gnarled off a similar scale forgetting two wanes 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.779
 so will others be true 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.769
 around ten percent in Italy 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.420
 we need to do a Boston year percent or mine, for example 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.430
 Enemy Endor Manisa Andreia leaves big percent he is black spirit 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.509
 so Denny Chin Meyer 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.409
 and percent yes I want to tell you all too much for me here now 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.090
 Schwizer simple waits until hopefully in late September Dear friends 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.449
 and percent 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.669
 then I hope 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.179
 Simon Seeger Herper estimation now need tires 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.969
 Wikus is rising strongly
