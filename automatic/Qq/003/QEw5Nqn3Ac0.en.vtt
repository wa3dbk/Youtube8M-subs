00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.310
 Welcome from the 10 15 o'clock you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.010
 to have a smartphone from alcatel 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 big selection and the biggest one the pixi 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 four and a half fix ii 3 4 and a half hot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.000
 even in the third generation of the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.160
 pixi smartphones from alcatel in the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.359
 monday series so that we have the big one 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.250
 have names and we can see you too 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.550
 can almost root between android ios 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.170
 but similar to and or firefox os and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 windows phone whereby I do not have any here 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.030
 Windows phone device just can see 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.899
 but then also use its corresponding 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.600
 just make android i believe 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 that's what's most in demand here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:49.260
 we have a 450 wv bvg screen ffw 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 vga screen 180 x 400 854 pixels so 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.300
 the translation with really very 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.300
 bad view angle 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 but this makes the smartphone easy 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.790
 cheaper we have a lot of violence or 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.119
 active optional in it and 512 megabytes 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.360
 or 1 gb ram depending on what you 're looking for 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.619
 model buys megapixel behind or 5 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 megapixel depending on 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.940
 if you buy the fourth version gave 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.720
 it is actually the change behind you 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.330
 behind as a camera front but always only 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.880
 vga and already noticed it 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.950
 There is not an old and old variant 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.790
 Lte variant has only a dual core 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.330
 processor in it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.070
 here the pixi three four and a half inches 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.140
 and here again the camera with lightning 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.830
 always keep an eye on it 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.869
 speakers micro usb microphone and 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.039
 switch and volume control and 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.550
 even then had nothing or 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.380
 top headphone jack and microphones 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.479
 So we go out into the menu of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.520
 chansons lollipop who but it is still 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.320
 not packed but probably an update 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.369
 but we are still the android 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.369
 buttons outside and release the camera start 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.640
 so 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.040
 then the camera will be here shortly 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.390
 look at how we can see 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 the quality is okay 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 but as a result the display has strong 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.330
 is viewing-angle-dependent makes 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.180
 that's not necessarily fun nfc by the way 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.569
 synonymous only in the full version in it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.430
 gps was at all to the channel and then 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.390
 here we see the very bad via 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.799
 camera in front 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.370
 of course slower 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.409
 is and conditionally suitable for self though 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 if you want that you can 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.560
 then still uses so much more wants 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.829
 do not count now except as I said 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.209
 there are also with firefox os but the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.280
 technical data stays pretty much 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.660
 equal but also who now 3g 4g 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640
 and castration does not just tell 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.410
 and you can also between 4 inches and 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.120
 three and a half inches on if we choose 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.950
 no four and a half should smartphone 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.599
 that's what it was with the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.950
 pixi 3 4 and a half to finance gravel 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.970
 until next time and for the first time 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.970
