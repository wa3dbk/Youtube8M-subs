was<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.790> of<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> guess<00:00:30.270> or<00:00:30.809> in<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> sense<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.619> few

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
was kind of I guess or in a sense a few

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.970 
was kind of I guess or in a sense a few
days<00:00:32.009> old<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:33.090> anyway<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.629> know<00:00:33.829> decided<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
days old but anyway you know decided to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
days old but anyway you know decided to
obviously<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> headshots<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.420> was

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
obviously go for the headshots that was

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.570 
obviously go for the headshots that was
the<00:00:36.720> main<00:00:36.870> objective<00:00:36.990> the<00:00:37.710> later<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
the main objective the later on I

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.100 
the main objective the later on I
started<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.970> build<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> streak<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the spawns and this map fully but I'm

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
the spawns and this map fully but I'm
quite<00:01:50.939> confident<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.599> this<00:01:51.779> side<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
quite confident with this side of the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
quite confident with this side of the
map<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.920> saw<00:01:53.219> we're<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.609> when<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.789> first

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
map as you saw we're at when I first

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.059 
map as you saw we're at when I first
started<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.139> can't<00:01:55.349> die<00:01:55.529> no<00:01:55.590> stick<00:01:55.889> and

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
started when the can't die no stick and

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.709 
started when the can't die no stick and
I<00:01:56.130> immediately<00:01:56.490> turned<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.029> my<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.359> you<00:01:57.509> see

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I immediately turned to my right you see

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
I immediately turned to my right you see
that<00:01:57.899> car<00:01:58.139> there<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.619> saw<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.219> blue<00:01:59.429> car

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
towards the second visa if you do get a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.850

UAV<00:02:31.850> after<00:02:32.360> getting<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.660> visa<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:33.530> he<00:02:33.620> saw

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
UAV after getting your visa then he saw

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.620 
UAV after getting your visa then he saw
it<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.130> well<00:02:34.160> but<00:02:34.520> sometimes<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.330> I'm

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
it as well but sometimes what I do I'm

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.230 
it as well but sometimes what I do I'm
so<00:02:35.810> lazy<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.770> call<00:02:36.980> out<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> UAV<00:02:37.640> as

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
so lazy that I just call out the UAV as

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.760 
so lazy that I just call out the UAV as
soon<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:38.660> again<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.560> now

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
soon as again I just like that now

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.240 
soon as again I just like that now
things<00:02:40.040> that's<00:02:40.250> kind<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.610> waste<00:02:41.230> because

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
things that's kind of a waste because

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.440 
things that's kind of a waste because
well<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.400> what's<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.700> point<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.000> calling<00:02:44.240> it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
well it what's the point of calling it

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.110 
well it what's the point of calling it
when<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> already<00:02:45.080> got<00:02:45.260> my<00:02:45.380> visa<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.850> was

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
when I already got my visa so that was

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.830 
when I already got my visa so that was
kind<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:48.200> dumb<00:02:49.070> dumb<00:02:49.700> mistake<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.330> my<00:02:50.480> behalf

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
kind of a dumb dumb mistake on my behalf

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.260 
kind of a dumb dumb mistake on my behalf
but<00:02:51.230> still<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.040> guess<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.460> didn't<00:02:52.760> affect<00:02:53.000> as

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
but still I guess that didn't affect as

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.690 
but still I guess that didn't affect as
much<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:54.050> hope<00:02:54.230> would<00:02:54.500> reason<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.980> me<00:02:55.130> dying<00:02:55.370> I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
much the hope would reason of me dying I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.320 
much the hope would reason of me dying I
died

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
died

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.810 
died
even<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.050> another<00:02:57.350> visa<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.070> another<00:02:58.250> EMP

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
even with another visa and another EMP

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.610 
even with another visa and another EMP
yeah<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> was<00:02:59.330> so<00:02:59.540> confused<00:02:59.810> at<00:03:00.260> how<00:03:00.290> is

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
yeah but I was so confused at how is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.040 
yeah but I was so confused at how is
that<00:03:00.770> possible<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> underestimated<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
that possible but I underestimated the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.630 
that possible but I underestimated the
play<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.560> was<00:03:03.650> going<00:03:03.920> against<00:03:04.310> because<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
play that I was going against because I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.270 
play that I was going against because I
did<00:03:04.940> kill<00:03:05.180> him<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.530> then<00:03:06.680> he<00:03:06.740> spawned<00:03:07.040> right

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
did kill him and then he spawned right

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.760 
did kill him and then he spawned right
next<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.700> me<00:03:07.820> at<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.090> area<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.140> he<00:03:09.560> came

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
next to me at this area here so he came

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.990 
next to me at this area here so he came
and<00:03:09.830> challenged<00:03:10.340> me<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.640> shouldn't<00:03:10.880> have

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
and challenged me and I shouldn't have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.490 
and challenged me and I shouldn't have
challenged<00:03:11.480> him<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.690> should<00:03:11.900> have<00:03:11.990> hit<00:03:12.260> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
challenged him I should have hit I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.010 
challenged him I should have hit I
should<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.160> taken<00:03:13.370> my<00:03:13.700> time<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.360> shouldn't
