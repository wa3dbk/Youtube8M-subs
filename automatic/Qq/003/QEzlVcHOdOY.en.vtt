00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
threshing box this is a week called

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.139 
threshing box this is a week called
akmal<00:01:50.009> vinca<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.810> process<00:01:51.990> of

akmal vinca so it's just a process of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.380 
akmal vinca so it's just a process of
rubbing<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> seeds<00:01:54.570> against<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> glass<00:01:55.830> I

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
rubbing the seeds against the glass I

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
rubbing the seeds against the glass I
could<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.539> do<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
could just do it right on see that's a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.430 
could just do it right on see that's a
major<00:01:59.490> new<00:01:59.850> invention<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.930> little<00:02:01.110> /

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
major new invention just a little /

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.980 
major new invention just a little /
because<00:02:01.800> without<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.340> slats<00:02:02.670> give<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because without the slats give you like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.559 
because without the slats give you like
this<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:05.550> with<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> slats<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.390> have

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
this but with the slats you have

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.340 
this but with the slats you have
something<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.819> rub<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:09.000> against<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.990> makes<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
something to rub them against it makes a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.980 
something to rub them against it makes a
huge<00:02:10.530> difference<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.060> way<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.660> trash

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
huge difference this is the way we trash

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.890 
huge difference this is the way we trash
our<00:02:13.350> seeds<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.670> way<00:02:14.880> refresh<00:02:15.599> our

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
our seeds this is the way refresh our

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.470 
our seeds this is the way refresh our
scenes<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.630> anyone<00:02:18.630> know

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.180 

so<00:02:22.489> when<00:02:23.489> your<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.879> grower<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:25.190> just

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so when your see grower you can see just

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.509 
so when your see grower you can see just
how<00:02:26.519> prolific<00:02:27.060> mother<00:02:27.420> nature<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.519> because

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
how prolific mother nature is because

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.130 
how prolific mother nature is because
you<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> quarter<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.299> million<00:02:30.540> seeds<00:02:30.930> in

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
you have a quarter of a million seeds in

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.100 
you have a quarter of a million seeds in
in<00:02:31.319> one<00:02:31.769> healthy<00:02:32.370> imran's<00:02:32.819> plant<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.870> save

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
in one healthy imran's plant if you save

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.070 
in one healthy imran's plant if you save
the<00:02:34.260> seeds<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.849> year<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> then

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the seeds of that for one year and then

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
the seeds of that for one year and then
planted<00:02:37.739> all<00:02:37.860> those<00:02:38.069> seeds<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.700> had<00:02:38.879> the
