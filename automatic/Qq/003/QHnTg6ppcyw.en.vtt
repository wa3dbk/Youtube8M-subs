hip-hop you certainly find it in jazz I

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.450 
hip-hop you certainly find it in jazz I
think<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.100> key<00:00:46.429> to<00:00:47.679> providing<00:00:48.679> good<00:00:48.949> solid

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
think the key to providing good solid

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.779 
think the key to providing good solid
fills<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.870> understand<00:00:51.469> number<00:00:52.219> one<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
fills is to understand number one the

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.540 
fills is to understand number one the
subdivision<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.809> chart<00:00:54.109> or<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.370> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
subdivision of the chart or the of the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.130 
subdivision of the chart or the of the
piece<00:00:55.730> of<00:00:55.910> music<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.539> we've<00:00:56.660> talked<00:00:56.989> about

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
piece of music and we've talked about

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.810 
piece of music and we've talked about
that<00:00:57.499> and<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.699> provide<00:00:59.570> good<00:01:00.260> fill<00:01:00.920> vocabulary

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
that and to provide good fill vocabulary

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.439 
that and to provide good fill vocabulary
for<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.690> film<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:04.129> if<00:01:04.430> we're<00:01:04.909> playing<00:01:05.120> in<00:01:05.390> a

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
for the film so if we're playing in a

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.090 
for the film so if we're playing in a
certain<00:01:05.780> style<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.230> music<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:06.890> don't

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
certain style of music and we don't

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.550 
certain style of music and we don't
understand<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.760> subdivision<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.659> our

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
understand the subdivision and our

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.310 
understand the subdivision and our
rhythmic<00:01:09.890> ideas<00:01:10.550> aren't<00:01:11.000> clear<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:11.990> going

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
rhythmic ideas aren't clear it's going

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.890 
rhythmic ideas aren't clear it's going
to<00:01:12.409> be<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> weak<00:01:12.800> sounding<00:01:13.310> fill<00:01:13.550> so<00:01:14.510> let<00:01:14.780> me

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
to be a weak sounding fill so let me

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.930 
to be a weak sounding fill so let me
give<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.200> an<00:01:15.290> example<00:01:15.460> here<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.640> an<00:01:16.670> eighth

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
give you an example here is an eighth

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.230 
give you an example here is an eighth
note<00:01:17.080> subdivision<00:01:18.080> with<00:01:19.010> an<00:01:19.250> unclear<00:01:19.820> fill

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
note subdivision with an unclear fill

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:41.649 
note subdivision with an unclear fill
concept

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.139 

now<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:43.530> poor<00:01:43.799> playing<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.970> it's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
now that's some poor playing but it's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.560 
now that's some poor playing but it's
also<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.590> unsure<00:01:47.039> concept<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.330> I'm

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
also I think an unsure concept now I'm

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
also I think an unsure concept now I'm
going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.460> focus<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.850> eighth<00:01:51.119> notes

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
going to really focus on eighth notes

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
going to really focus on eighth notes
and<00:01:51.780> sixteenth<00:01:52.649> notes<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> try<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> sharpen

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and sixteenth notes and try to sharpen

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:24.979 
and sixteenth notes and try to sharpen
everything<00:01:55.110> up<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.549> ideas<00:02:24.180> were<00:02:24.360> definite

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
everything up so my ideas were definite

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.729 
everything up so my ideas were definite
but<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.739> were<00:02:25.799> really<00:02:26.280> based<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.739> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
but they were really based on the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.309 
but they were really based on the
subdivisions<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.819> certain<00:02:30.150> groove<00:02:30.420> same

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
subdivisions of this certain groove same

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:52.490 
subdivisions of this certain groove same
thing<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.799> sixteenth<00:02:32.280> notes

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.130 

the<00:02:53.500> fill<00:02:53.950> should<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> continuation<00:02:55.599> of

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the fill should be a continuation of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.370 
the fill should be a continuation of
that<00:02:56.260> rhythmic<00:02:57.040> idea<00:02:57.670> if<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.510> break<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.080> flow

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
that rhythmic idea if you break the flow

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.430 
that rhythmic idea if you break the flow
it<00:03:00.010> breaks<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.390> sequence<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.200> song

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
it breaks the the sequence of the song

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.800 
it breaks the the sequence of the song
let<00:03:03.220> me<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.520> let<00:03:03.790> me<00:03:03.849> break<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.300> flow<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> little

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
let me do let me break the flow a little

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:27.270 
let me do let me break the flow a little
bit<00:03:24.569> if<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.630> change<00:03:26.110> note<00:03:26.440> values<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.250> change

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
bit if you change note values and change

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.030 
bit if you change note values and change
your<00:03:27.910> intensity<00:03:28.480> then<00:03:29.049> everything<00:03:29.709> kind<00:03:29.890> of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
your intensity then everything kind of

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.180 
your intensity then everything kind of
gets<00:03:30.160> ripped<00:03:30.519> apart<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.959> try<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> continue

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
gets ripped apart so I try to continue

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.910 
gets ripped apart so I try to continue
with<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.730> idea<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.170> basis<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.739> my

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
with the idea that was the basis of my

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.910 
with the idea that was the basis of my
groove<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.180> will<00:03:37.420> help<00:03:37.690> us<00:03:37.959> connect<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
groove so that will help us connect the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.150 
groove so that will help us connect the
phrases<00:03:39.580> or<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> sections<00:03:40.330> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.569> song<00:03:41.160> same

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
phrases or the sections of the song same

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.400 
phrases or the sections of the song same

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.860 

if<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.709> go<00:04:19.010> away<00:04:19.160> from<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.700> style<00:04:20.060> inch<00:04:20.480> and

like<00:04:25.970> this<00:04:43.389> so<00:04:44.389> I'm<00:04:44.840> mixing<00:04:45.080> straight<00:04:45.740> eighth

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919

notes within the triplet concept and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.280 
notes within the triplet concept and
