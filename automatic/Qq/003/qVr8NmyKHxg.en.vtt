ringing quick video to show you how to
fix<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.429> old<00:00:08.700> pulse<00:00:09.389> limiter<00:00:10.429> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.790> was

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
fix the old pulse limiter so this was

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.350 
fix the old pulse limiter so this was
the<00:00:12.530> old<00:00:13.530> design<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.519> old<00:00:14.670> pulse<00:00:14.969> limiter

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the old design for the old pulse limiter

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.910 
the old design for the old pulse limiter
old<00:00:15.570> design<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:18.270> previous<00:00:18.869> design<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.830> the

post<00:00:20.160> limiter<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.080> try<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
post limiter so if you try it in the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.589 
post limiter so if you try it in the
news<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> new<00:00:24.000> snapshot<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.840> 30<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
because since Jeb improved redstone it's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.690

again<00:01:51.240> pulls<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> block<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.610> works

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
again pulls in the block it just works

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
again pulls in the block it just works
like<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> normal<00:01:54.420> pulse<00:01:54.630> limiter<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.740> i'm

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
like a normal pulse limiter now i'm

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.929 
like a normal pulse limiter now i'm
gonna<00:01:56.280> take<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> saddle<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
gonna take the saddle of it and if you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.300 
gonna take the saddle of it and if you
or<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.590> look<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.890> trial

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
or if you want it to have look at trial

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.590 
or if you want it to have look at trial
with<00:02:03.299> proud<00:02:04.229> i<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.680> probably<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
with proud i don't know probably look a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
with proud i don't know probably look a
lighting<00:02:06.600> system<00:02:06.780> well<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> new<00:02:08.039> snapshot

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
lighting system well in the new snapshot

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
lighting system well in the new snapshot
you<00:02:08.520> wouldn't<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:08.879> need<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.780> existing

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you wouldn't really need a like existing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.630 
you wouldn't really need a like existing
with<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> daylight<00:02:10.679> sensor<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.190> stuff

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
with the daylight sensor and stuff

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.309 
with the daylight sensor and stuff
yeah<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.330> yeah<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.810> could

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
yeah so just like this yeah so you could

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.140 
yeah so just like this yeah so you could
power<00:02:18.500> any<00:02:18.800> any<00:02:19.099> type<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> redstone<00:02:19.760> device

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
power any any type of redstone device

just<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.690> post<00:02:20.959> limiter<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.800> was<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
just with this post limiter it was one

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.729 
just with this post limiter it was one
of<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.370> most<00:02:22.550> efficient<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.450> effective

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
of the most efficient and effective

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.050 
of the most efficient and effective
devices<00:02:24.739> there<00:02:24.980> at<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.280> end<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.670> like

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
devices there at that end that like

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.320 
devices there at that end that like
helped<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> red<00:02:28.550> zone<00:02:28.580> things<00:02:29.090> all

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
helped the all the red zone things all

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.960 
helped the all the red zone things all
the<00:02:29.720> redstone<00:02:30.170> McCann<00:02:30.739> mechanisms<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.850> were

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
the redstone McCann mechanisms that were

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.080 
the redstone McCann mechanisms that were
made<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.530> kind<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.920> broke<00:02:34.400> because<00:02:34.640> Jeb

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
made but it kind of broke because Jeb

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.250 
made but it kind of broke because Jeb
messed<00:02:35.660> everything<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:37.340> no<00:02:37.880> worries<00:02:38.260> here

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
messed everything up but no worries here

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.920 
messed everything up but no worries here
is<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.500> solution<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.780> works

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
is a solution for that and it works

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.350 
is a solution for that and it works
properly<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:43.790> what<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> did

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
properly so just that's just what I did

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.809 
properly so just that's just what I did
there<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:45.680> did<00:02:45.890> one<00:02:46.130> example<00:02:46.550> because

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
there is I just did one example because

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.500 
there is I just did one example because
i<00:02:46.940> was<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.209> bored<00:02:47.569> yeah<00:02:48.819> they're<00:02:49.819> yeah<00:02:49.850> so

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
i was really bored yeah they're yeah so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
i was really bored yeah they're yeah so
works<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> light<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.100> what<00:02:52.730> else<00:02:52.880> could

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
works like a light and what else could

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
works like a light and what else could
you<00:02:53.120> have<00:02:54.430> what<00:02:55.430> else<00:02:55.730> could<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.120> have<00:02:57.880> hmm

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
you have what else could you have hmm

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:09.000 
you have what else could you have hmm
what<00:03:00.709> else<00:03:00.739> could<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.989> know<00:03:03.140> what

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.460 

well<00:03:10.010> oh<00:03:10.250> I'm<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.180> old<00:03:11.360> snapshots<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
well oh I'm in the old snapshots in it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.220 
well oh I'm in the old snapshots in it
that's<00:03:13.160> why<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.430> looks<00:03:13.610> like<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.049> not<00:03:15.049> to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
that's why it looks like this not to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.900 
that's why it looks like this not to
worry<00:03:15.380> that's<00:03:15.739> already<00:03:16.069> been<00:03:16.280> fixed<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:21.910> don't

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
worry that's already been fixed I don't

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.490 
worry that's already been fixed I don't
know<00:03:22.970> if<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:23.120> gonna<00:03:23.269> work<00:03:23.359> but<00:03:23.840> let's<00:03:24.140> get<00:03:24.320> it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
know if it's gonna work but let's get it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.670 
know if it's gonna work but let's get it
right<00:03:25.810> okay<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:27.170> doesn't<00:03:27.560> work<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:29.680> just

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
right okay so it doesn't work you just

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.130 
right okay so it doesn't work you just
got<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:30.980> work<00:03:31.160> really<00:03:31.400> fast

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.320 

it's<00:03:38.740> not<00:03:38.890> really<00:03:39.069> robust<00:03:39.640> because<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.120> like

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
it's not really robust because it like

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.730 
it's not really robust because it like
if<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.569> do<00:03:40.780> too<00:03:40.990> fast<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.440> breaks<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:44.440> doesn't

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
if you do too fast it breaks it doesn't

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.650 
if you do too fast it breaks it doesn't
break<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.190> still<00:03:45.430> works<00:03:45.670> but<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.330> doesn't

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
break it still works but it just doesn't

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.080 
break it still works but it just doesn't
work<00:03:46.990> as<00:03:47.260> efficiently<00:03:47.709> or<00:03:48.160> as<00:03:48.340> fast<00:03:48.580> enough<00:03:48.880> I

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
work as efficiently or as fast enough I

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.880 
work as efficiently or as fast enough I
should<00:03:49.600> because<00:03:49.840> there's<00:03:50.230> two<00:03:50.410> Pistons<00:03:50.830> that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
should because there's two Pistons that

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.830 
should because there's two Pistons that
need<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:52.180> into<00:03:52.209> play<00:03:52.600> I'm<00:03:53.470> saying<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.330> yeah

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
need to go into play I'm saying so yeah

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.560 
need to go into play I'm saying so yeah
that's<00:03:56.110> about<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.970> fun<00:03:58.240> with<00:03:58.420> this

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
that's about it I have fun with this

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.350 
that's about it I have fun with this
