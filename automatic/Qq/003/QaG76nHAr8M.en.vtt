a Volkswagen Audi or anything in Libby W
family<00:00:15.030> okay<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> did<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
family okay so the first thing I did to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
family okay so the first thing I did to
diagnose<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.670> issues<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.359> car<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.840> went

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
diagnose the issues with the car I went

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.540 
diagnose the issues with the car I went
into<00:00:19.289> back<00:00:19.560> home<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> looked<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.220> anything

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
into back home and looked for anything

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.920 
into back home and looked for anything
that<00:00:20.699> stood<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.270> fault<00:00:21.510> codes<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that stood out in the fault codes and I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.380 
that stood out in the fault codes and I
didn't<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.619> anything<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> car<00:00:24.180> was

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
didn't really get anything the car was

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.460 
didn't really get anything the car was
very<00:00:24.689> flat<00:00:25.170> over<00:00:25.590> 3,000<00:00:26.340> rpm<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.750> more<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.439> over

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
very flat over 3,000 rpm in more so over

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.769 
very flat over 3,000 rpm in more so over
2,000<00:00:29.220> rpm<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.150> wasn't<00:00:30.539> really

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
2,000 rpm as well I just wasn't really

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.420 
2,000 rpm as well I just wasn't really
seeing<00:00:31.050> any<00:00:31.199> power<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.980> seeing<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
seeing any power but I was seeing it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
seeing any power but I was seeing it
right<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> bottom<00:00:33.149> end<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:33.960> got<00:00:34.230> into

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
right at the bottom end so I've got into

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
right at the bottom end so I've got into
vacum<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> I've<00:00:35.399> pulled<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> data<00:00:36.600> log<00:00:36.840> in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
vacum and I've pulled some a data log in

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
vacum and I've pulled some a data log in
and<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.950> screen<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.370> yellow<00:00:38.760> line

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and you can see on screen a yellow line

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.139 
and you can see on screen a yellow line
around<00:00:39.390> 550<00:00:40.050> mark<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> air<00:00:41.070> mass

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
around 550 mark that's the air mass

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.639 
around 550 mark that's the air mass
reading<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> MAF<00:00:42.780> sensor<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.290> getting

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
reading that the MAF sensor is getting

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.209 
reading that the MAF sensor is getting
its<00:00:44.100> seen<00:00:44.420> 550<00:00:45.420> air<00:00:45.570> mass<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.440> red<00:00:46.770> line<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
its seen 550 air mass the red line is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
its seen 550 air mass the red line is
what<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> car<00:00:47.700> expects<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.450> seen<00:00:48.719> all

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
what the car expects to be seen all

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.619 
what the car expects to be seen all
about<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.489> seeing<00:00:50.730> because

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
about what you should be seeing because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
about what you should be seeing because
of<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.260> seeing<00:00:52.530> less<00:00:53.010> fuel<00:00:53.399> put<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.789> now

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
of this was seeing less fuel put in now

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.760 
of this was seeing less fuel put in now
wanted<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> walls<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> sense<00:00:55.350> check<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
wanted to walls to do a sense check to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
wanted to walls to do a sense check to
make<00:00:55.860> sure<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> didn't<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> boost<00:00:56.879> leak<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
make sure I didn't have a boost leak I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.580 
make sure I didn't have a boost leak I
did<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:57.930> at<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> couple<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.500> things

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
did have a look at a couple of things

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
did have a look at a couple of things
and<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.640> had<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> split<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and I thought I had to split in the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
and I thought I had to split in the
pipes<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.750> replaced<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.680> just

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
pipes I replaced it but it was just

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
pipes I replaced it but it was just
wearing<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.239> added<00:01:03.449> tiniest

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
wearing out I also for added tiniest

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.750 
wearing out I also for added tiniest
leak<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.979> must<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.309> been<00:01:05.400> ever<00:01:05.549> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
leak which it must have been ever so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
leak which it must have been ever so
slightly<00:01:06.030> didn't<00:01:06.360> affect<00:01:06.689> things<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.500> can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
slightly didn't affect things you can

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
slightly didn't affect things you can
see<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> graph<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> boost

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
see on this graph here that the boost

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
see on this graph here that the boost
that<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.840> specified<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> booster<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> seen

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that is specified in the booster is seen

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
that is specified in the booster is seen
a<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.240> less<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.510> same<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.049> fact<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> cars

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
a more or less the same in fact the cars

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
a more or less the same in fact the cars
probably<00:01:14.580> producing<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.210> more<00:01:15.570> boost<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
probably producing a bit more boost and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
probably producing a bit more boost and
it<00:01:16.049> should<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> final<00:01:17.520> part<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it should do in the final part of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
it should do in the final part of
logging<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.409> looking<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
logging you can see just looking at the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
logging you can see just looking at the
Green<00:01:20.250> Line<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> fuel<00:01:21.450> line

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
Green Line there where the fuel line

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.810 
Green Line there where the fuel line
should<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> been<00:01:23.189> limited<00:01:23.610> by<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
should be that it's been limited by the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840 
should be that it's been limited by the
smoke<00:01:24.150> limitation<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:26.040> influenced

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
smoke limitation and that is influenced

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
smoke limitation and that is influenced
by<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.330> air<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.840> seeing<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
by how much air it's seeing through the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.560 
by how much air it's seeing through the
MAF<00:01:28.439> sensor<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> Green<00:01:29.820> Line<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> running

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
MAF sensor so the Green Line is running

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
MAF sensor so the Green Line is running
well<00:01:30.780> under<00:01:31.140> everything<00:01:31.590> else<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.070> blue<00:01:32.250> line

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
well under everything else the blue line

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.859 
well under everything else the blue line
is<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> engine<00:01:33.270> speed<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
is just the engine speed so that is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.359 
is just the engine speed so that is
going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
going to be all over but we can see that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
going to be all over but we can see that
the<00:01:35.549> yellow<00:01:36.180> line<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.810> talked<00:01:37.470> limitation

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the yellow line for talked limitation

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580 
the yellow line for talked limitation
and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.150> talk<00:01:39.390> west<00:01:39.750> line<00:01:39.930> which<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.350> red

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and the talk west line which is in red

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
and the talk west line which is in red
are<00:01:40.799> both<00:01:41.040> moving<00:01:41.460> around<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> little

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
are both moving around there is a little

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
are both moving around there is a little
bit<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> deviation<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> engine<00:01:43.710> speed

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bit of deviation with the engine speed

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
bit of deviation with the engine speed
but<00:01:44.130> they're<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.579> moving<00:01:45.000> around

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
but they're pretty much moving around

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
but they're pretty much moving around
with<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> Green<00:01:45.689> Line<00:01:45.869> running<00:01:46.229> underneath

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with the Green Line running underneath

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
with the Green Line running underneath
so<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> point<00:01:47.909> I'm<00:01:48.030> fairly<00:01:48.270> sure<00:01:48.360> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
so at this point I'm fairly sure it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.940 
so at this point I'm fairly sure it's
the<00:01:48.750> math<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.229> gone<00:01:49.380> however<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the math that's gone however all the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
the math that's gone however all the
triac<00:01:50.430> I've<00:01:50.579> read<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.180> line<00:01:51.390> which<00:01:51.659> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
triac I've read about on line which is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
triac I've read about on line which is
called<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> diode<00:01:52.229> hack<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> diet<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
called a diode hack see the diet on

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
called a diode hack see the diet on
screen<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:54.990> already<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.619> place

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
screen I've already put this in place

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.020 
screen I've already put this in place
but<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.430> illustrate<00:01:56.820> where<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but I'm just going to illustrate where I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
but I'm just going to illustrate where I
put<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> take<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> taping

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
put it so I'm going to take the taping

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
put it so I'm going to take the taping
off<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.979> diode<00:01:59.399> sits<00:01:59.700> between<00:01:59.820> pins<00:02:00.360> four<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
off the diode sits between pins four and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.830 
off the diode sits between pins four and
five<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.310> flows<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.939> left<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
five and it flows to the left so to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.219 
five and it flows to the left so to
speak<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:06.180> into<00:02:06.509> pin<00:02:06.750> four<00:02:07.049> would

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
speak so the going into pin four would

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
speak so the going into pin four would
be<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> wire<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:08.940> pin<00:02:09.119> five

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
be the wire and going into pin five

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
be the wire and going into pin five
would<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.660> other<00:02:09.810> wire<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.470> has<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> red

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
would be the other wire that has the red

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
would be the other wire that has the red
mark<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> side<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.959> I've

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
mark on the side of it so just as I've

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
mark on the side of it so just as I've
taken<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.440> tape

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
taken the tape

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
taken the tape
now<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.280> illustrate<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.120> -<00:02:15.540> it's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
now I can illustrate to you - it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.450 
now I can illustrate to you - it's
exactly<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.200> goals<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> D<00:02:17.190> that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
exactly that's goals you have the D that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.550 
exactly that's goals you have the D that
runs<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> right<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> connector<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
runs to the right of the connector and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
runs to the right of the connector and
just<00:02:20.550> moving<00:02:20.850> across<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> left<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> can

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
just moving across to the left you can

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
just moving across to the left you can
see<00:02:22.020> where<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> red<00:02:22.860> side<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.310> diode<00:02:23.580> is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
see where the red side of the diode is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000 
see where the red side of the diode is
put<00:02:24.060> area<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> pin<00:02:24.600> five<00:02:24.870> position<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.590> there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
put area the pin five position is there

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.250 
put area the pin five position is there
so<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:27.480> done<00:02:27.750> let's<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.110> look

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
so with that now done let's have a look

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.750 
so with that now done let's have a look
at<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> output<00:02:28.590> we've<00:02:28.950> seen<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.340> back<00:02:29.520> on

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
at the output we've seen from back on

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.330 
at the output we've seen from back on
okay<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.110> snapshot<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:31.950> we

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
okay so this is just a snapshot but we

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.670 
okay so this is just a snapshot but we
can<00:02:32.490> see<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.270> stays<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.630> flat<00:02:34.110> line<00:02:34.380> with

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
can see that it stays a flat line with

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.500 
can see that it stays a flat line with
the<00:02:34.770> diode<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.310> until<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.670> hit<00:02:35.850> three<00:02:36.090> thousand

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the diode in until I hit three thousand

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.390 
the diode in until I hit three thousand
rpm<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.050> thereabout<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.100> see<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
rpm or thereabout and then we see the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.040 
rpm or thereabout and then we see the
air<00:02:38.520> must<00:02:38.760> pick<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.390> tells<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.840> put

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
air must pick up and it tells it to put

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.900 
air must pick up and it tells it to put
in<00:02:40.140> its<00:02:40.290> maximum<00:02:40.680> fuel<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.670> look<00:02:41.790> at

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
in its maximum fuel in so if we look at

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.700 
in its maximum fuel in so if we look at
the<00:02:41.970> green<00:02:42.180> line<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.660> fuel<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.560> now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the green line for the fuel in I can now

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.350 
the green line for the fuel in I can now
see<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.040> moving<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.550> line<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:44.940> everything

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
see it moving in line with everything

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.510 
see it moving in line with everything
else<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.750> only<00:02:45.960> over<00:02:46.380> three<00:02:46.740> thousand<00:02:47.130> rpm

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
else but only over three thousand rpm

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.550 
else but only over three thousand rpm
and<00:02:47.760> again<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.690> wanted<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.170> check<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and again I just wanted to check the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
and again I just wanted to check the
boost<00:02:49.770> make<00:02:50.100> sure<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.460> working<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:51.000> line

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
boost make sure that's working in line

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.060 
boost make sure that's working in line
what<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.540> should<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.260> I'm<00:02:52.620> happy<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:52.950> what

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
what it should be and I'm happy of what

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.220 
what it should be and I'm happy of what
I'm<00:02:53.160> seeing<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.520> screen<00:02:53.610> there<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.020> at<00:02:55.140> this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
I'm seeing on screen there so at this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750 
I'm seeing on screen there so at this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
point through driving and also through

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760 
point through driving and also through
feel<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.210> everything<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.410> kind<00:02:58.650> of

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
feel of everything I can kind of

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.500 
feel of everything I can kind of
guarantee<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> mass<00:02:59.970> sensor<00:03:00.360> but

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
guarantee that it is the mass sensor but

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
guarantee that it is the mass sensor but
what<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:00.750> need<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.050> do<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.440> replace<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.800> so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
what I do need to do is to replace it so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.150 
what I do need to do is to replace it so
if<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> diode<00:03:02.760> model<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.480> 3000<00:03:04.380> rpm<00:03:04.740> I've<00:03:04.890> seen

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
if the diode model of 3000 rpm I've seen

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.190 
if the diode model of 3000 rpm I've seen
four<00:03:05.490> if<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:06.150> power<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.930> fact<00:03:07.110> that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
four if not more power for the fact that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.620 
four if not more power for the fact that
the<00:03:07.350> ECU<00:03:07.770> was<00:03:07.920> being<00:03:08.100> told<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.300> getting

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the ECU was being told it was getting

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.750 
the ECU was being told it was getting
fir<00:03:09.780> there<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.830> put<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.130> full<00:03:11.430> amount

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
fir there so you can put the full amount

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
fir there so you can put the full amount
of<00:03:11.940> fuel<00:03:12.180> into<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> what<00:03:14.100> we're<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.340> to

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
of fuel into it so what we're going to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.920 
of fuel into it so what we're going to
do<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.060> we're<00:03:15.210> just<00:03:15.330> going<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.510> watch<00:03:15.750> as

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
do here is we're just going to watch as

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.710 
do here is we're just going to watch as
I<00:03:16.020> take<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.680> old<00:03:17.040> map<00:03:17.310> sensor<00:03:17.610> off<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
I take the old map sensor off so you

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.199 
I take the old map sensor off so you
take<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.020> intake<00:03:19.530> pipe<00:03:19.770> off<00:03:20.010> first<00:03:20.280> there's<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
take the intake pipe off first there's a

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.180 
take the intake pipe off first there's a
couple<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.780> screws<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.530> we're<00:03:22.830> just<00:03:22.860> going<00:03:23.130> to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
couple of screws so we're just going to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.660 
couple of screws so we're just going to
undo<00:03:23.520> those<00:03:24.590> now<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:25.830> people<00:03:26.190> after<00:03:26.489> that

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
undo those now some people after that

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.600 
undo those now some people after that
you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.000> clean<00:03:27.209> map<00:03:27.540> sensors<00:03:28.280> I've<00:03:29.280> decided

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
you can clean map sensors I've decided

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.400 
you can clean map sensors I've decided
it<00:03:29.760> was<00:03:29.850> best<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.090> go<00:03:30.270> over<00:03:30.450> new<00:03:30.600> one<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.989> went

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
it was best to go over new one I went

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
it was best to go over new one I went
with<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.190> about<00:03:32.250> twenty<00:03:33.180> eight<00:03:33.209> thirty

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
with one for about twenty eight thirty

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.199 
with one for about twenty eight thirty
pounds<00:03:34.260> delivered<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.830> think<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> might<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
pounds delivered I think it might be a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.500 
pounds delivered I think it might be a
remanufactured<00:03:36.989> one<00:03:37.910> we'll<00:03:38.910> show<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.360> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
remanufactured one we'll show that in a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.800 
remanufactured one we'll show that in a
minute

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
minute

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.020 
minute
so<00:03:40.590> these<00:03:40.680> screws<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.100> be<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.310> bit<00:03:41.520> tricky<00:03:41.880> just

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
so these screws can be a bit tricky just

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.729 
so these screws can be a bit tricky just
getting<00:03:42.420> over<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.690> right<00:03:42.900> sized<00:03:43.230> screwdriver

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
getting over the right sized screwdriver

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.910 
getting over the right sized screwdriver
which<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.100> didn't<00:03:44.459> quite<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.739> will

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
which I didn't quite do but they will

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.000 
which I didn't quite do but they will
just<00:03:47.100> come<00:03:47.250> off<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> diode<00:03:49.410> module<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
just come off so with a diode module I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.860 
just come off so with a diode module I
felt<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> power<00:03:50.550> coming<00:03:50.850> back<00:03:51.030> over<00:03:51.270> 3,000

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
felt the power coming back over 3,000

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
felt the power coming back over 3,000
rpm<00:03:52.230> bit<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.500> still<00:03:52.770> sluggish<00:03:53.250> before<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:53.940> so

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
rpm bit of still sluggish before then so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.090 
rpm bit of still sluggish before then so
up<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.330> about<00:03:54.480> 2,000<00:03:55.170> rpm<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:55.800> there<00:03:55.980> where

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
up to about 2,000 rpm it was there where

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.270 
up to about 2,000 rpm it was there where
there<00:03:56.220> abouts<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.020> left<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:59.070> new

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
there abouts so on the left is the new

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.850 
there abouts so on the left is the new
MAF<00:03:59.459> sensor<00:03:59.489> on<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.930> right<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.470> old<00:04:01.620> one

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
MAF sensor on the right is the old one

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.760 
MAF sensor on the right is the old one
it<00:04:02.280> doesn't<00:04:02.790> really<00:04:02.940> look<00:04:03.390> much<00:04:04.110> different<00:04:04.170> so

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
it doesn't really look much different so

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.900 
it doesn't really look much different so
it<00:04:04.890> must<00:04:05.100> be<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> wire<00:04:05.520> that's<00:04:05.730> running

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
it must be the wire that's running

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.150 
it must be the wire that's running
inside<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.680> completely<00:04:07.680> worn<00:04:08.010> out

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
inside of it just completely worn out

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.110 
inside of it just completely worn out
and<00:04:08.370> not<00:04:08.459> working<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.970> should<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:11.120> again

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and not working as it should do again

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.090 
and not working as it should do again
this<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.690> show<00:04:12.959> how<00:04:13.470> they<00:04:13.620> look<00:04:13.830> you

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
this is just to show how they look you

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.860 
this is just to show how they look you
can't<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:14.910> tell<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.209> difference<00:04:15.239> popping

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
can't really tell the difference popping

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.360 
can't really tell the difference popping
maybe<00:04:16.140> one<00:04:16.530> doesn't<00:04:16.830> look<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:17.310> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
maybe one doesn't look like it's the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.810 
maybe one doesn't look like it's the
most<00:04:17.609> shiny<00:04:17.880> new<00:04:18.180> plastic<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.609> we're<00:04:20.730> gonna

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
most shiny new plastic so we're gonna

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.950 
most shiny new plastic so we're gonna
get<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> new<00:04:21.180> mouth<00:04:21.450> we're<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> pop

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
get the new mouth we're going to pop

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.260 
get the new mouth we're going to pop
that<00:04:21.989> on<00:04:22.580> stick<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.669> screws<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.150> there

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
that on stick the screws in there

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.890 
that on stick the screws in there
and<00:04:27.669> then<00:04:28.669> we're<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.419> do<00:04:29.569> all<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
and then we're going to do all the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.350 
and then we're going to do all the
piping<00:04:30.289> up<00:04:30.440> we're<00:04:31.400> going<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> check<00:04:31.819> that<00:04:31.849> I'm

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
piping up we're going to check that I'm

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.270 
piping up we're going to check that I'm
going<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.569> get<00:04:32.750> some<00:04:32.930> new<00:04:33.139> logs<00:04:33.410> done<00:04:33.949> as<00:04:34.099> well

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
going to get some new logs done as well

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370 
going to get some new logs done as well
and<00:04:35.000> let's<00:04:35.180> see<00:04:35.419> what<00:04:35.599> we<00:04:35.690> get<00:04:35.870> out<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.229> new

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
and let's see what we get out the new

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.610 
and let's see what we get out the new
logs<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.750> want<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> take<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.110> moment<00:04:39.319> to<00:04:39.530> do

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
logs so you want to take a moment to do

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.040 
logs so you want to take a moment to do
it<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:39.860> up<00:04:40.069> and<00:04:40.340> almost<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.479> last<00:04:41.630> thing<00:04:41.900> is

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
it all up and almost the last thing is

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.510 
it all up and almost the last thing is
just<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.349> put<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.590> spring<00:04:42.949> clip<00:04:43.160> over<00:04:43.430> the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
just to put the spring clip over the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.570 
just to put the spring clip over the
hose<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.930> can<00:04:45.199> be<00:04:45.319> a<00:04:45.349> bit<00:04:45.500> tricky<00:04:45.620> using<00:04:46.400> more

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
hose this can be a bit tricky using more

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.460 
hose this can be a bit tricky using more
grips<00:04:46.789> or<00:04:46.940> wood<00:04:47.090> lines<00:04:47.300> get<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.509> spring<00:04:47.840> clip

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
grips or wood lines get a spring clip

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.140 
grips or wood lines get a spring clip
tool<00:04:48.710> at<00:04:48.860> some<00:04:49.069> point<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.580> this<00:04:49.669> tends<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.060> do

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
tool at some point but this tends to do

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.760 
tool at some point but this tends to do
weak<00:04:50.300> sometimes<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.259> takes<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.470> couple<00:04:51.500> of

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
weak sometimes it takes a couple of

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.800 
weak sometimes it takes a couple of
attempts<00:04:52.099> to<00:04:52.190> do<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.639> saw<00:04:52.819> earlier<00:04:53.270> they<00:04:53.780> can

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
attempts to do you saw earlier they can

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.809 
attempts to do you saw earlier they can
fly<00:04:54.199> off<00:04:54.349> when<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.620> take<00:04:54.800> them<00:04:54.979> off<00:04:55.099> just<00:04:55.669> be

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
fly off when you take them off just be

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.960 
fly off when you take them off just be
patient<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.330> adjust<00:04:56.660> your<00:04:56.690> grips<00:04:57.199> and<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
patient and adjust your grips and the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.570 
patient and adjust your grips and the
very<00:04:59.240> last<00:04:59.449> thing<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.919> put<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.250> connector

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
very last thing is to put the connector

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.230 
very last thing is to put the connector
on<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:03.380> we'll<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:03.710> put<00:05:03.889> that<00:05:03.949> on<00:05:04.159> and<00:05:04.580> let's

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
on so we'll just put that on and let's

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.350 
on so we'll just put that on and let's
pull<00:05:05.509> up<00:05:05.539> some<00:05:05.810> results<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:06.409> look<00:05:06.590> at<00:05:06.710> how<00:05:06.919> the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
pull up some results and look at how the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.879 
pull up some results and look at how the
vacuum<00:05:08.360> results<00:05:08.810> differ<00:05:09.229> so<00:05:09.560> we'll<00:05:09.710> have<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
vacuum results differ so we'll have a

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.980 
vacuum results differ so we'll have a
look<00:05:10.159> at<00:05:10.370> what<00:05:10.520> we<00:05:10.699> had<00:05:10.970> now<00:05:11.509> is<00:05:11.690> all<00:05:11.840> been

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
look at what we had now is all been

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.300 
look at what we had now is all been
fitted<00:05:12.349> and<00:05:12.530> I'll<00:05:12.949> give<00:05:13.099> you<00:05:13.159> some

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
fitted and I'll give you some

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.129 
fitted and I'll give you some
side-by-side<00:05:13.849> comparisons<00:05:14.509> to<00:05:14.630> show<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:14.900> how

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
side-by-side comparisons to show you how

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.290 
side-by-side comparisons to show you how
it's<00:05:15.289> all<00:05:15.440> turned<00:05:15.470> out<00:05:15.919> so<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:16.880> first<00:05:16.909> thing

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
it's all turned out so the first thing

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.820 
it's all turned out so the first thing
we<00:05:17.449> see<00:05:17.690> with<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.199> comparison

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
we see with the to comparison

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.040 
we see with the to comparison
side-by-side<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.610> right<00:05:19.849> is<00:05:20.120> after<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.930> left

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
side-by-side the right is after the left

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.899 
side-by-side the right is after the left
is<00:05:21.229> before<00:05:21.560> we<00:05:22.009> see<00:05:22.190> on<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.370> right<00:05:22.580> one<00:05:22.880> that

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
is before we see on the right one that

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.140 
is before we see on the right one that
the<00:05:23.180> yellow<00:05:23.479> air<00:05:23.690> mass<00:05:24.199> is<00:05:24.440> moving<00:05:24.770> around<00:05:25.190> all

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
the yellow air mass is moving around all

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.520 
the yellow air mass is moving around all
over<00:05:26.569> with<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> revs<00:05:27.050> which<00:05:27.229> is<00:05:27.349> fantastic

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
over with the revs which is fantastic

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.129 
over with the revs which is fantastic
and<00:05:28.069> again<00:05:28.789> here<00:05:29.030> with<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.360> four<00:05:29.659> on<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> left

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
and again here with the four on the left

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.570 
and again here with the four on the left
and<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.380> after<00:05:30.650> on<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.830> right<00:05:30.979> we<00:05:31.159> can<00:05:31.310> see<00:05:31.370> on

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
and the after on the right we can see on

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.430 
and the after on the right we can see on
the<00:05:31.729> right<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.240> fuel<00:05:32.539> is<00:05:32.719> moving<00:05:33.229> in

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
the right that the fuel is moving in

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.870 
the right that the fuel is moving in
line<00:05:33.680> with<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.039> reps<00:05:34.280> with<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.550> taught

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
line with the reps with the taught

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.159 
line with the reps with the taught
requests<00:05:35.389> with<00:05:35.539> everything<00:05:35.930> that's<00:05:36.020> being

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
requests with everything that's being

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.439 
requests with everything that's being
put<00:05:36.469> through<00:05:36.500> there<00:05:36.919> so<00:05:37.550> again<00:05:37.820> really<00:05:38.120> happy

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
put through there so again really happy

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.450 
put through there so again really happy
with<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.080> lastly<00:05:39.740> just<00:05:39.830> looking<00:05:40.280> at<00:05:40.370> the

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
with that and lastly just looking at the

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.430 
with that and lastly just looking at the
boost<00:05:40.669> this<00:05:41.240> wasn't<00:05:41.630> an<00:05:41.719> issue<00:05:41.870> but<00:05:42.169> I<00:05:42.259> just

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
boost this wasn't an issue but I just

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.350 
boost this wasn't an issue but I just
wanted<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.740> show<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.159> it<00:05:43.460> was<00:05:43.789> working<00:05:44.270> in

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
wanted to show that it was working in

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.149 
wanted to show that it was working in
line<00:05:44.539> before<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.229> after<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.620> muffler<00:05:45.979> fixed

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
line before and after the muffler fixed

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.399 
line before and after the muffler fixed
again<00:05:46.699> maybe<00:05:47.419> boosting<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.900> bit<00:05:48.020> higher<00:05:48.229> than

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
again maybe boosting a bit higher than

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.020 
again maybe boosting a bit higher than
it<00:05:48.500> should<00:05:48.560> do<00:05:48.889> but<00:05:49.130> I'm<00:05:49.219> happy<00:05:49.550> with<00:05:49.639> that

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
it should do but I'm happy with that

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.240 
it should do but I'm happy with that
so<00:05:50.719> the<00:05:50.990> overall<00:05:51.289> result<00:05:51.680> is<00:05:51.770> that<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.039> have

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
so the overall result is that I have

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.610 
so the overall result is that I have
seen<00:05:52.490> my<00:05:52.610> normal<00:05:53.060> power<00:05:53.270> back<00:05:53.630> in<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.960> car<00:05:54.139> it

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
seen my normal power back in the car it

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.379 
seen my normal power back in the car it
now<00:05:54.830> behaves<00:05:55.159> as<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.550> did<00:05:55.669> before<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:56.030> map

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
now behaves as it did before the map

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.420 
now behaves as it did before the map
when<00:05:56.659> what<00:05:57.560> I'm<00:05:57.650> showing<00:05:57.830> you<00:05:57.919> here<00:05:58.130> is<00:05:58.190> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
when what I'm showing you here is the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.339 
when what I'm showing you here is the
process<00:05:58.789> I've<00:05:58.940> gone<00:05:59.150> through<00:05:59.479> so<00:05:59.780> I<00:06:00.020> believe

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
process I've gone through so I believe

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.170 
process I've gone through so I believe
that<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.710> math<00:06:00.860> was<00:06:01.069> at<00:06:01.219> full<00:06:01.490> but<00:06:01.819> I<00:06:01.849> didn't

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
that the math was at full but I didn't

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.550 
that the math was at full but I didn't
want<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.389> go<00:06:02.479> out<00:06:02.599> and<00:06:02.719> spend<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:03.080> money<00:06:03.259> on<00:06:03.469> a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
want to go out and spend the money on a

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.439 
want to go out and spend the money on a
new<00:06:03.919> math<00:06:04.130> until<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.550> could<00:06:04.789> confirm<00:06:05.120> that<00:06:05.180> it

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
new math until I could confirm that it

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.959 
new math until I could confirm that it
was<00:06:05.599> so<00:06:06.380> I've<00:06:06.650> used<00:06:06.860> a<00:06:06.949> diode<00:06:07.159> mod<00:06:07.580> which

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
was so I've used a diode mod which

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.959 
was so I've used a diode mod which
showed<00:06:08.360> me<00:06:08.539> that<00:06:09.039> given<00:06:10.039> a<00:06:10.130> circuit<00:06:10.340> that<00:06:10.819> it

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
showed me that given a circuit that it

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.700 
showed me that given a circuit that it
would<00:06:11.150> make<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.479> power<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:12.169> reason<00:06:12.469> for<00:06:12.590> the

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
would make the power the reason for the

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.760 
would make the power the reason for the
delay<00:06:12.889> up<00:06:13.159> to<00:06:13.370> 3000<00:06:13.969> rpm<00:06:14.360> is<00:06:14.599> the<00:06:14.900> voltage<00:06:15.740> drop

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
delay up to 3000 rpm is the voltage drop

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.520 
delay up to 3000 rpm is the voltage drop
that<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:16.370> get<00:06:16.580> over<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:16.969> diode<00:06:17.330> after<00:06:18.110> 3,000

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
that you get over the diode after 3,000

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.140 
that you get over the diode after 3,000
rpm<00:06:18.889> voltage<00:06:19.219> picks<00:06:19.490> up<00:06:19.610> enough<00:06:19.819> to<00:06:19.940> put

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
rpm voltage picks up enough to put

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.990 
rpm voltage picks up enough to put
across<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.419> full<00:06:20.719> reading<00:06:21.550> when<00:06:22.550> I<00:06:22.580> put<00:06:22.789> the<00:06:22.880> new

across a full reading when I put the new
math<00:06:23.180> in<00:06:23.419> we<00:06:23.630> can<00:06:23.750> see<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:23.960> everything<00:06:24.440> is

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
math in we can see that everything is

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.189 
math in we can see that everything is
working<00:06:25.069> fine<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:25.669> ok<00:06:26.030> there<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.539> part<00:06:27.139> of

working fine and ok there and part of

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.839 
working fine and ok there and part of
the<00:06:27.289> reason<00:06:27.530> I've<00:06:27.650> gone<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:28.009> do<00:06:28.130> is<00:06:28.250> extensive

everything is to illustrate to people

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.089 
everything is to illustrate to people
you<00:06:32.240> know<00:06:32.330> what<00:06:32.569> this<00:06:32.690> can<00:06:32.930> be<00:06:33.139> but<00:06:33.650> also<00:06:33.830> I've

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.099 
you know what this can be but also I've

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:35.529 
you know what this can be but also I've
