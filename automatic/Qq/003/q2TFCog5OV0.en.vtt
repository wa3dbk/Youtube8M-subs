00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
gonna love it and basically I started

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.880 
gonna love it and basically I started
with<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.360> stock<00:01:45.630> circuit<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> once<00:01:46.710> we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
with the the stock circuit and once we

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.290 
with the the stock circuit and once we
fired<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> working<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
fired it up and got it working and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.270 
fired it up and got it working and
cranking<00:01:48.720> real<00:01:48.899> good

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
cranking real good

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.359 
cranking real good
I<00:01:50.310> saw<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> schematic<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.039> he<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I saw the schematic and you know he and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.609 
I saw the schematic and you know he and
Shelby<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.940> mod<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.360> he<00:01:54.509> recommended<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
Shelby one mod that he recommended and I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.080 
Shelby one mod that he recommended and I
came<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:56.729> mod<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.710> had<00:01:58.710> basically

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
came up with another mod I had basically

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
came up with another mod I had basically
this<00:02:00.090> switch<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> current

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this switch right here in the current

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.760 
this switch right here in the current
position<00:02:02.069> it<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.090> factory<00:02:03.770> position

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
position it is the factory position

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.669 
position it is the factory position
which<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:06.240> allowing<00:02:06.509> negative<00:02:07.020> feedback<00:02:07.350> into

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
which is allowing negative feedback into

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.800 
which is allowing negative feedback into
the<00:02:07.709> power<00:02:08.009> amp<00:02:08.250> circuit<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.299> flip<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the power amp circuit if we flip it this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.949 
the power amp circuit if we flip it this
way<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:11.610> removes<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> negative<00:02:12.600> feedback

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
way and it removes the negative feedback

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.800 
way and it removes the negative feedback
which<00:02:14.000> makes<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.269> bit<00:02:15.360> louder<00:02:15.570> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
which makes a little bit louder and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.319 
which makes a little bit louder and
breaks<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.799> little<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.130> better<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:17.940> worse

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
breaks up a little bit better or worse

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.360 
breaks up a little bit better or worse
depending<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.900> how<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.079> like<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.590> let's<00:02:20.190> do

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
depending on how you like it so let's do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.990 
depending on how you like it so let's do
it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:46.720

fender designed it put it up or you put

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.490 
fender designed it put it up or you put
it<00:03:02.250> well<00:03:02.940> we're<00:03:03.629> looking<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.049> amp<00:03:04.170> upside

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it well we're looking at the amp upside

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.009 
it well we're looking at the amp upside
down<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:06.569> that's<00:03:06.810> doing

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
down but this is down what that's doing

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.330 
down but this is down what that's doing
is<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:07.409> putting<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.069> 25<00:03:08.879> micro<00:03:09.299> farad

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
is it's putting in a 25 micro farad

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.670 
is it's putting in a 25 micro farad
bypass<00:03:11.340> cap<00:03:11.640> at<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> first<00:03:12.420> tube<00:03:12.989> stage<00:03:13.290> so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
bypass cap at the first tube stage so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:35.839 
bypass cap at the first tube stage so
we'll<00:03:13.859> do<00:03:14.159> an<00:03:14.250> a/b<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.640> that

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.100 

makes<00:03:36.849> it<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> little<00:03:37.180> bit<00:03:37.390> base<00:03:37.599> here<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> little

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
makes it a little bit base here a little

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.390 
makes it a little bit base here a little
bit<00:03:38.319> more<00:03:38.470> gain<00:03:38.790> who's<00:03:39.790> back<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.420> factory

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
bit more gain who's back to the factory

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.280 
bit more gain who's back to the factory
now<00:03:43.379> we<00:03:44.379> put<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.920> 50<00:03:45.340> micro<00:03:45.670> farad<00:03:46.000> cap

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
now we put in a 50 micro farad cap

00:03:46.290 --> 00:04:43.680 
now we put in a 50 micro farad cap
larger<00:03:48.030> capacitance<00:03:49.030> more<00:03:49.420> base<00:03:49.599> more<00:03:49.959> gain

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.380 

nice<00:04:45.130> nice<00:04:46.130> break<00:04:46.430> up<00:04:46.640> it's<00:04:46.790> not<00:04:46.910> obscenely

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
nice nice break up it's not obscenely

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.360 
nice nice break up it's not obscenely
loud<00:04:47.690> but<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.200> definitely<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:49.100> can<00:04:49.220> play

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
loud but it's definitely you can play

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.510 
loud but it's definitely you can play
onstage<00:04:49.550> with<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:51.130> say<00:04:52.130> I'm<00:04:52.250> here<00:04:52.430> it's

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
onstage with it say I'm here it's

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.240 
onstage with it say I'm here it's
probably<00:04:52.670> about<00:04:52.910> 90<00:04:53.330> something<00:04:53.570> DB<00:04:54.050> far<00:04:55.010> from

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
probably about 90 something DB far from

probably about 90 something DB far from
here<00:04:55.370> bleeding<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:55.910> definitely<00:04:56.480> my<00:04:57.110> cable

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
laminated two-by-fours and Mason I would

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.770 
laminated two-by-fours and Mason I would
think<00:05:06.200> they<00:05:06.290> called<00:05:06.560> regular<00:05:07.190> maple<00:05:07.780> feather

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
think they called regular maple feather

think they called regular maple feather
style<00:05:09.110> back<00:05:09.380> so<00:05:09.620> it's<00:05:09.790> not<00:05:10.790> necessarily

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
style back so it's not necessarily

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.090 
style back so it's not necessarily
something<00:05:11.630> glorious<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.620> would<00:05:12.740> expect

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
good tones to come from but it actually

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.100 
good tones to come from but it actually
sounds<00:05:15.020> amazing<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:17.510> I'm<00:05:17.690> hooked<00:05:17.840> for<00:05:18.080> life
