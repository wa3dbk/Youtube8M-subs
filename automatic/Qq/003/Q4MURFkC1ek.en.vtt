just going to start off by drawing a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
just going to start off by drawing a
little<00:00:28.619> bar<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:31.940> we've<00:00:32.940> been<00:00:33.180> asked<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.020> how

little bar and we've been asked it's how

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.479 
little bar and we've been asked it's how
to<00:00:34.260> find<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:34.860> much<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> each<00:00:35.430> ingredient

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to find out how much of each ingredient

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.090 
to find out how much of each ingredient
would<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> need<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.780> cake<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.230> six

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
would you need to make a cake for six

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
would you need to make a cake for six
people<00:00:38.600> now<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> reason<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.200> just

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
people now the reason that I'm just

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
people now the reason that I'm just
drawing<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> bar<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
drawing a bar here is I'm just going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.160 
drawing a bar here is I'm just going to
draw<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:42.989> bar<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.559> represent<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> 200<00:00:45.989> grams

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
draw this bar to represent the 200 grams

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
draw this bar to represent the 200 grams
of<00:00:46.350> flour<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.039> need<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> 200

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
of flour that we need so this is the 200

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.459 
of flour that we need so this is the 200
grams<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.120> flour<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.870> using<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
grams of flour that we are using for

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.470 
grams of flour that we are using for
four<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.420> could<00:00:57.539> say<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
four people so what we could say is that

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.250 
four people so what we could say is that
200<00:01:00.480> grams<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.780> flour<00:01:01.670> makes<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.910> makes<00:01:03.329> enough

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
200 grams of flour makes it makes enough

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
200 grams of flour makes it makes enough
cake<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.680> four<00:01:04.920> people<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.570> say

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
cake for four people so what I could say

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
cake for four people so what I could say
is<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.830> split<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:10.080> four<00:01:10.670> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
is that if I split this into four so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.359 
is that if I split this into four so
just<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.860> split<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.729> box<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.330> four

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
just just split in this box into four

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.880 
just just split in this box into four
then<00:01:17.939> by<00:01:18.420> splitting<00:01:18.899> it<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.259> four<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.649> can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
then by splitting it into four I can

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
then by splitting it into four I can
find<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.090> flour<00:01:24.380> each<00:01:25.380> person

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
find out how much flour each person

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.840 
find out how much flour each person
needs<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> I've<00:01:28.950> split<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.399> two<00:01:29.520> forks

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
needs so I've split it in two forks

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
needs so I've split it in two forks
there's<00:01:30.060> four<00:01:30.240> people<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> could<00:01:31.740> say

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
there's four people so what I could say

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.300 
there's four people so what I could say
is<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.069> each<00:01:33.619> each<00:01:36.530> box<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:38.130> each<00:01:38.280> part<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.939> my

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
is that each each box or each part of my

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.690 
is that each each box or each part of my
bar<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.609> worth<00:01:41.909> 50<00:01:42.450> grams<00:01:42.719> each<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
bar is worth 50 grams each so if it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
bar is worth 50 grams each so if it's
worth<00:01:44.880> 50<00:01:45.390> grams<00:01:45.630> each<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.500> enough

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
worth 50 grams each and that's enough

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460 
worth 50 grams each and that's enough
for<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:47.219> person<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:48.000> need<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> make<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.170> six

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
for one person I need to make it for six

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.919 
for one person I need to make it for six
people<00:01:49.819> so<00:01:50.819> what<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.270> say<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
people so what I could say then is that

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.229 
people so what I could say then is that
I<00:01:51.989> need<00:01:52.259> another<00:01:53.189> two<00:01:53.640> lots<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.869> 50<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.789> so<00:01:57.030> how

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
I need another two lots of 50 and so how

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.639 
I need another two lots of 50 and so how
much<00:01:57.479> flour<00:01:57.840> would<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.319> need

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
much flour would I need

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:07.190 
much flour would I need
well<00:01:59.459> flour<00:01:59.789> I'm<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:02.299> 300<00:02:03.299> grams

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.430 

so<00:02:07.770> 50<00:02:08.190> plus<00:02:08.399> 50<00:02:08.550> plus<00:02:08.759> 50<00:02:09.209> plus<00:02:09.240> 50<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:10.289> was

so 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 that was

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.970 
so 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 that was
for<00:02:10.619> four<00:02:10.830> people<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.290> top<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.709> I'll

how<00:02:23.430> much<00:02:23.610> would<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:23.910> need<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.180> make<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:25.350> cake<00:02:25.890> for

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
how much would I need to make a cake for

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.089 
how much would I need to make a cake for
five<00:02:26.340> people<00:02:26.819> or<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.480> would<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.830> 250

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.780 

so<00:02:34.700> one<00:02:34.939> two<00:02:35.299> three<00:02:35.329> four<00:02:35.900> five<00:02:36.469> people<00:02:36.799> now

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
so one two three four five people now

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.729 
so one two three four five people now
what<00:02:38.060> I'll<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.109> I'm<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.260> gonna<00:02:39.469> do

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
what I'll do is I'm just gonna do

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.670 
what I'll do is I'm just gonna do
exactly<00:02:40.249> the<00:02:40.400> same<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:41.209> all<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.530> other

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
exactly the same for all of the other

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.520 
exactly the same for all of the other
ingredients<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.510> now<00:02:44.780> instead<00:02:45.109> of<00:02:45.290> having

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
ingredients so now instead of having

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.770 
ingredients so now instead of having
this<00:02:45.859> box<00:02:46.159> representing<00:02:46.939> my<00:02:47.060> flour<00:02:47.359> I'm<00:02:47.599> gonna

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
this box representing my flour I'm gonna

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.270 
this box representing my flour I'm gonna
call<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.230> mush

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
call it mush

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.610 
call it mush
I'm<00:02:49.670> gonna<00:02:49.790> call<00:02:49.999> it<00:02:50.150> sugar<00:02:50.540> instead<00:02:50.810> and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I'm gonna call it sugar instead and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.309 
I'm gonna call it sugar instead and
that's<00:02:51.709> 100<00:02:52.400> grams<00:02:52.639> now<00:02:54.069> 100<00:02:55.069> grams<00:02:56.109> has<00:02:57.109> been

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
that's 100 grams now 100 grams has been

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.670 
that's 100 grams now 100 grams has been
split<00:02:57.620> into<00:02:57.799> four<00:02:58.159> again<00:02:58.519> because<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.359> makes

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
split into four again because it makes

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.220 
split into four again because it makes
for<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.129> recipe<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:01.819> for<00:03:01.939> four<00:03:02.209> people<00:03:02.659> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
for it the recipe is for four people and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.979 
for it the recipe is for four people and
that<00:03:03.919> means<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.969> if<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.180> splitting<00:03:05.659> 100

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
that means that if I'm splitting 100

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.539 
that means that if I'm splitting 100
grams<00:03:06.200> by<00:03:06.560> four<00:03:06.859> I<00:03:06.889> can<00:03:07.189> say<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.489> I'm

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
grams by four I can say that I'm

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.449 
grams by four I can say that I'm
dividing<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.269> by<00:03:08.419> four<00:03:08.689> so<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.680> 100<00:03:10.040> divided<00:03:10.430> by

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
dividing it by four so I 100 divided by

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.830 
dividing it by four so I 100 divided by
four<00:03:10.760> means<00:03:10.969> that<00:03:11.150> each<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.299> these<00:03:11.599> are<00:03:11.810> going

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
four means that each of these are going

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.250 
four means that each of these are going
to<00:03:11.989> be<00:03:12.079> 25<00:03:12.680> grams<00:03:13.129> each<00:03:14.439> so<00:03:15.439> 25<00:03:16.069> grams<00:03:16.370> each<00:03:17.260> for

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
to be 25 grams each so 25 grams each for

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.490 
to be 25 grams each so 25 grams each for
six<00:03:18.469> people<00:03:18.650> I'm<00:03:19.069> going<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.489> need<00:03:19.730> another

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
six people I'm going to need another

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.830 
six people I'm going to need another
225s<00:03:21.500> on<00:03:21.590> top<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.949> that<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.699> 25<00:03:23.150> plus<00:03:23.389> 25<00:03:23.510> plus

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
225s on top of that so 25 plus 25 plus

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.500 
225s on top of that so 25 plus 25 plus
25<00:03:24.469> plus<00:03:24.500> 25<00:03:25.159> plus<00:03:25.370> 25<00:03:26.180> plus<00:03:26.480> 25<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.790> sugar<00:03:28.790> I'm

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
25 plus 25 plus 25 plus 25 so sugar I'm

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.280 
25 plus 25 plus 25 plus 25 so sugar I'm
going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.079> need<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> hundred<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.919> fifty<00:03:31.250> grams

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
going to need a hundred and fifty grams

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.520 
going to need a hundred and fifty grams
I<00:03:33.340> could<00:03:34.340> also<00:03:34.459> think<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.969> this<00:03:35.150> as<00:03:35.260> six<00:03:36.260> times

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
I could also think of this as six times

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.789 
I could also think of this as six times
25<00:03:37.159> it<00:03:37.310> doesn't<00:03:37.519> matter<00:03:37.730> too<00:03:37.849> much<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:39.290> then

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
25 it doesn't matter too much and then

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.119 
25 it doesn't matter too much and then
for<00:03:40.699> five<00:03:40.939> people<00:03:41.180> well<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.199> need<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:42.560> two

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
for five people well I need one two

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.490 
for five people well I need one two
three<00:03:43.519> four<00:03:43.879> five<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:45.079> that<00:03:45.109> would<00:03:45.349> be<00:03:45.470> a

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
three four five so that would be a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.629 
three four five so that would be a
hundred<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.280> 25<00:03:47.000> grams<00:03:47.620> 5<00:03:48.620> times<00:03:49.840> 25<00:03:51.489> let's<00:03:52.489> do

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
hundred and 25 grams 5 times 25 let's do

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.670 
hundred and 25 grams 5 times 25 let's do
it<00:03:52.699> for<00:03:52.909> the<00:03:53.090> next<00:03:53.209> one<00:03:55.599> so<00:03:56.599> for<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> next<00:03:57.079> 150

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
it for the next one so for the next 150

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.729 
it for the next one so for the next 150
grams<00:03:58.009> of<00:03:58.189> butter<00:03:58.479> so<00:03:59.479> now<00:03:59.659> my<00:04:00.349> bar<00:04:00.560> is

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
grams of butter so now my bar is

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.900 
grams of butter so now my bar is
representing<00:04:01.400> butter

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.890 

which<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.840> 50<00:04:05.140> grams<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:05.910> 50<00:04:06.910> grams<00:04:07.180> split

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
which is 50 grams and so 50 grams split

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.480 
which is 50 grams and so 50 grams split
into<00:04:08.080> four<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.010> 50<00:04:09.990> divided<00:04:10.990> by<00:04:11.020> 4

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.680 

and<00:04:14.790> that's<00:04:15.060> going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.300> give<00:04:15.450> me<00:04:15.480> 12.5<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.450> each

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and that's going to give me 12.5 so each

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.390 
and that's going to give me 12.5 so each
of<00:04:18.720> these<00:04:19.110> are<00:04:19.530> now<00:04:20.040> worth<00:04:20.280> 12.5<00:04:22.010> how<00:04:23.010> much<00:04:23.280> am

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
of these are now worth 12.5 how much am

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.680 
of these are now worth 12.5 how much am
I<00:04:23.490> going<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:23.850> need<00:04:24.030> for<00:04:26.240> how<00:04:27.240> much<00:04:27.390> am<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.600> going

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
I going to need for how much am I going

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.800 
I going to need for how much am I going
to<00:04:27.870> need<00:04:27.990> for<00:04:28.170> six<00:04:28.470> people

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
well I've got four of these already I've

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.230 
well I've got four of these already I've
got<00:04:35.110> four<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.440> these<00:04:35.530> 12.5<00:04:36.160> already<00:04:36.490> I'm<00:04:37.000> going

hopefully you're kind of seeing the
pattern<00:05:12.560> there's<00:05:13.340> forming<00:05:13.729> here

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
pattern there's forming here

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.460 
pattern there's forming here
so<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:15.080> chocolate<00:05:15.500> 80<00:05:15.710> grams<00:05:16.960> and<00:05:17.960> grams<00:05:18.259> of

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
going to be 20 on each and so that means

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.879 
going to be 20 on each and so that means
I<00:05:27.830> need<00:05:27.949> an<00:05:28.070> extra<00:05:28.639> two<00:05:28.880> 20s<00:05:29.449> for<00:05:30.110> six<00:05:30.350> people

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
about

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.240 
about
having<00:06:43.380> half<00:06:43.620> an<00:06:43.800> egg<00:06:43.920> but<00:06:44.660> there<00:06:45.660> you<00:06:45.720> go<00:06:46.250> so

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
having half an egg but there you go so

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.620 
having half an egg but there you go so
I'm<00:06:47.340> hoping<00:06:47.730> that<00:06:47.790> he's<00:06:48.240> kind<00:06:48.480> of<00:06:48.510> making

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
I'm hoping that he's kind of making

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.420 
I'm hoping that he's kind of making
sense<00:06:48.960> this<00:06:49.170> is<00:06:49.320> kind<00:06:49.530> of<00:06:49.560> just<00:06:49.770> quite<00:06:50.160> a<00:06:50.190> basic

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
sense this is kind of just quite a basic

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.680 
sense this is kind of just quite a basic
idea<00:06:51.090> of<00:06:51.300> proportion<00:06:52.400> but<00:06:53.400> people<00:06:53.760> do<00:06:53.910> kind<00:06:54.600> of

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
idea of proportion but people do kind of

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.440 
idea of proportion but people do kind of
tend<00:06:54.930> to<00:06:55.020> get<00:06:55.139> confused<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:56.150> find<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:57.330> is

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
tend to get confused I find it is

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.600 
tend to get confused I find it is
helpful<00:06:57.960> to<00:06:58.110> draw<00:06:58.380> up<00:06:58.620> a<00:06:58.740> bar<00:06:58.919> like<00:06:59.160> I've<00:06:59.340> done

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
helpful to draw up a bar like I've done

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.909 
helpful to draw up a bar like I've done
but<00:06:59.790> there<00:07:00.000> are<00:07:00.090> lots<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.389> different<00:07:00.750> ways<00:07:00.919> in

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
but there are lots of different ways in

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.850 
but there are lots of different ways in
which<00:07:01.980> you<00:07:02.160> can<00:07:02.430> do<00:07:02.610> this
