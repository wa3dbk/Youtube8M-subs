00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
energy for one fighting energy if you

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.370 
energy for one fighting energy if you
have<00:01:09.520> even<00:01:09.670> two<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:10.060> them<00:01:10.240> out<00:01:10.330> there<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:11.170> do<00:01:11.320> a
