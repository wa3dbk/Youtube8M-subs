athleanx.com<00:00:09.360> today<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.650> want<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> talk<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.400> you

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
athleanx.com today I want to talk to you

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120 
athleanx.com today I want to talk to you
about<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.330> difference<00:00:12.929> between<00:00:13.019> two<00:00:13.889> words

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
about the difference between two words

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.550 
about the difference between two words
we<00:00:14.340> hear<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> lot<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:15.410> flexibility<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
we hear a lot about flexibility and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.160 
we hear a lot about flexibility and
mobility<00:00:17.119> there<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.270> two<00:00:18.480> different<00:00:18.990> words

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
mobility there are two different words

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
mobility there are two different words
obviously<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.310> two<00:00:20.550> very

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
obviously what they have two very

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.040 
obviously what they have two very
different<00:00:20.970> meanings<00:00:21.359> when<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.750> comes<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
different meanings when it comes to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590 
different meanings when it comes to
getting<00:00:22.320> your<00:00:22.529> body<00:00:22.769> ready<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:24.029> train<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.449> your

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
getting your body ready to train at your

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
getting your body ready to train at your
best<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.380> difference<00:00:25.859> guys<00:00:26.039> between

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
best the difference guys between

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.080 
best the difference guys between
flexibility<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.630> mobility<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:29.090> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
flexibility and mobility is that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
flexibility and mobility is that
flexibility<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.470> deal<00:00:31.710> mostly<00:00:32.250> with

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
flexibility is going to deal mostly with

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.080 
flexibility is going to deal mostly with
tissue<00:00:33.270> length<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.170> mobility<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:36.030> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
tissue length and mobility is going to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
tissue length and mobility is going to
deal<00:00:36.300> mostly<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.899> tissue<00:00:37.890> temperature<00:00:38.550> or

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
deal mostly with tissue temperature or

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.930 
deal mostly with tissue temperature or
how<00:00:38.910> warm<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.870> body<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.100> loose<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
how warm your body is and how loose you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
how warm your body is and how loose you
feel<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.600> let<00:00:43.110> me<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.469> exactly<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
feel so let me show you exactly what the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
feel so let me show you exactly what the
difference<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> couple<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> examples

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
difference is with a couple of examples

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.049 
difference is with a couple of examples
first<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.100> deal<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.280> flexibility

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
first of all let's deal with flexibility

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
first of all let's deal with flexibility
when<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.629> talk<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.989> flexibility<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> guys

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
when we talk about flexibility you guys

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.889 
when we talk about flexibility you guys
have<00:00:50.070> heard<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.340> talking<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.719> dynamic<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
have heard me talking about dynamic and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
have heard me talking about dynamic and
static<00:00:52.530> flexibility<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> make

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
static flexibility and we want to make

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
static flexibility and we want to make
sure<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.629> we're<00:00:54.780> doing<00:00:54.989> most<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.320> our<00:00:55.440> static

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
sure that we're doing most of our static

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.979 
sure that we're doing most of our static
flexibility<00:00:56.520> static<00:00:56.850> stretching<00:00:57.270> before<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
flexibility static stretching before we

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
flexibility static stretching before we
go<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> bed<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.500> night<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.520> heal<00:00:59.910> our

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
go to bed at night as we heal our

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
go to bed at night as we heal our
muscles<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.199> tend<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> heal<00:01:01.649> shorter<00:01:02.010> we

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
muscles will tend to heal shorter we

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
muscles will tend to heal shorter we
want<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.460> sure<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.840> we

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
want to make sure that we do that and we

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
want to make sure that we do that and we
do<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> over<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> course<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.159> because

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
do that over the course of time because

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
do that over the course of time because
a<00:01:05.790> consistent<00:01:06.659> effort<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.619> static

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a consistent effort on our static

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.880 
a consistent effort on our static
flexibility<00:01:08.640> will<00:01:09.119> produce<00:01:09.500> increases<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
flexibility will produce increases in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
flexibility will produce increases in
length<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> muscle<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> runs

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
length so if you have a muscle that runs

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
length so if you have a muscle that runs
from<00:01:14.010> A<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.790> B<00:01:15.409> here<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.460> person<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> has<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
from A to B here the person that has the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
from A to B here the person that has the
muscle<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.869> runs<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.290> A<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.920> B<00:01:20.960> here<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
muscle that runs from A to B here has a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.030 
muscle that runs from A to B here has a
more<00:01:23.310> flexible<00:01:23.869> muscle<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.229> muscle<00:01:25.500> length

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
more flexible muscle the muscle length

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.730 
more flexible muscle the muscle length
is<00:01:26.280> longer<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.060> literally<00:01:27.630> longer<00:01:28.500> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is longer it's literally longer it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
is longer it's literally longer it's
more<00:01:29.009> flexible<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.150> you're

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
more flexible that is what you're

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
more flexible that is what you're
working<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.380> those<00:01:31.590> types<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
working on when you do those types of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
working on when you do those types of
static<00:01:32.670> stretching<00:01:33.030> drills<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.479> trying

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
static stretching drills you're trying

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
static stretching drills you're trying
to<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> muscle<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> slowly<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.119> surely

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to get the muscle to slowly but surely

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
to get the muscle to slowly but surely
increase<00:01:36.930> its<00:01:37.140> length<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.159> more

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
increase its length so you have more

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.819 
increase its length so you have more
available<00:01:39.119> range<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> motion<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
available range of motion that is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.630 
available range of motion that is
flexibility<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.180> talk<00:01:42.390> about<00:01:42.659> mobility

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
flexibility when we talk about mobility

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
flexibility when we talk about mobility
we're<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:44.850> talking<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we're really talking about the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.980 
we're really talking about the
temperature<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.970> joint<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> have

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
temperature of the joint so if you have

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.310 
temperature of the joint so if you have
a<00:01:49.259> joint<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.130> has<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.880> flexibility<00:01:51.659> from

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a joint that has the flexibility from

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.039 
a joint that has the flexibility from
here<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.790> another<00:01:54.450> person<00:01:54.840> has<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
here to here and another person has a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.459 
here to here and another person has a
flexibility<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
flexibility from here to here but this

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.969 
flexibility from here to here but this
person<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.210> mobile<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:01.320> person<00:02:01.799> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
person is mobile and this person is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.990 
person is mobile and this person is
immobile

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
immobile

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370 
immobile
okay<00:02:03.329> well<00:02:03.479> we'll<00:02:03.810> deal<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
okay well we'll deal with that this

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
okay well we'll deal with that this
visitor<00:02:04.860> extreme<00:02:05.189> range<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.610> motion<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.200> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
visitor extreme range of motion but this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.339 
visitor extreme range of motion but this
person<00:02:07.469> may<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.979> move<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.849> far<00:02:09.179> he<00:02:09.929> may<00:02:10.110> have

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
person may not move this far he may have

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.770 
person may not move this far he may have
the<00:02:10.410> length<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.400> guy<00:02:11.610> has<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the length that this guy has here of the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.170 
the length that this guy has here of the
muscle

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
muscle

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.990 
muscle
belly<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.930> he<00:02:14.079> can't<00:02:14.379> express<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.280> because

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
belly but he can't express that because

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.089 
belly but he can't express that because
he<00:02:16.269> doesn't<00:02:16.510> have<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> mobility<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.769> the

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
he doesn't have the mobility in the

surrounding joint to express the full

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.920 
surrounding joint to express the full
flexibility<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> perfect<00:02:22.120> example<00:02:22.329> so<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
flexibility so a perfect example so you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.339 
flexibility so a perfect example so you
might<00:02:23.079> wind<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.409> being<00:02:23.620> more<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.730> this

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
might wind up being more like this

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.990 
might wind up being more like this
functionally<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:27.159> good<00:02:27.430> example<00:02:27.970> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
functionally so a good example that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.289 
functionally so a good example that
would<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.709> lats<00:02:29.950> okay<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.730> might

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
would be with your lats okay I might

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.619 
would be with your lats okay I might
have<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:32.579> flexibility<00:02:33.579> in<00:02:33.730> my<00:02:33.879> last<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.510> get

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
have the flexibility in my last to get

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.690 
have the flexibility in my last to get
all<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.959> way<00:02:35.049> up<00:02:35.079> through<00:02:35.859> here<00:02:36.069> up<00:02:36.250> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
all the way up through here up to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.630 
all the way up through here up to
vertical<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.329> beyond<00:02:37.599> with<00:02:38.109> my<00:02:38.319> arm<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:39.609> I

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
vertical and beyond with my arm but I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880 
vertical and beyond with my arm but I
may<00:02:39.819> not<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.180> mobility<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.140> my<00:02:41.290> shoulder

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
may not have the mobility in my shoulder

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.960 
may not have the mobility in my shoulder
to<00:02:42.760> get<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.689> point<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.620> my<00:02:45.220> mobility

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
to get up to this point so my mobility

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.960 
to get up to this point so my mobility
is<00:02:46.150> limiting<00:02:47.019> my<00:02:47.500> potential<00:02:47.980> flexibility<00:02:48.819> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
is limiting my potential flexibility and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.899 
is limiting my potential flexibility and
until<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.510> work<00:02:49.900> out<00:02:50.109> my<00:02:50.139> mobility<00:02:50.920> then<00:02:51.790> we're

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
until I work out my mobility then we're

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.610 
until I work out my mobility then we're
going<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.090> realize<00:02:52.629> or<00:02:52.930> fully<00:02:53.139> Express<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
flexibility that I actually have so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.960 
flexibility that I actually have so
where<00:02:56.290> does<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.470> mobility<00:02:56.980> fit<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:57.849> your

where does the mobility fit in with your
training<00:02:58.170> mobility<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.290> something<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.620> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
training mobility is something that you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.099 
training mobility is something that you
could<00:03:00.040> do<00:03:00.280> before<00:03:00.819> your<00:03:01.329> workouts<00:03:01.780> it's<00:03:02.079> a

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
like you know you have great flexibility

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.339

through your arms of your shoulders but
you<00:03:41.470> feel<00:03:41.709> stiff<00:03:42.099> that<00:03:42.909> feeling<00:03:43.449> of<00:03:43.540> stiffness

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
you feel stiff that feeling of stiffness

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.050 
you feel stiff that feeling of stiffness
regardless<00:03:44.739> of<00:03:44.859> what<00:03:45.010> your<00:03:45.129> flexibility<00:03:45.760> is

regardless of what your flexibility is

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.420 
regardless of what your flexibility is
is<00:03:46.440> something<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.590> usually<00:03:47.769> comes<00:03:48.190> with<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
is something that usually comes with a

is something that usually comes with a
mobility<00:03:48.879> issue<00:03:49.329> so<00:03:49.690> if<00:03:49.780> you're<00:03:49.900> finding

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
mobility issue so if you're finding

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.110 
mobility issue so if you're finding
yourself<00:03:50.260> feeling<00:03:50.709> very<00:03:50.889> stiff<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.970> can

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
yourself feeling very stiff that you can

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.420 
yourself feeling very stiff that you can
work<00:03:52.329> through<00:03:52.599> as<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.409> warm<00:03:53.650> up<00:03:53.859> you've<00:03:54.250> got

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
work through as you warm up you've got

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.710 
work through as you warm up you've got
more<00:03:54.639> mobility<00:03:54.909> work<00:03:55.209> because<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.479> have<00:03:55.510> to

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
more mobility work because you have to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.659 
more mobility work because you have to
do<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.930> again<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.229> can<00:03:56.379> do<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.650> before<00:03:57.220> your

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
do it again you can do that before your

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.599 
do it again you can do that before your
workout<00:03:58.090> here's<00:03:58.720> my<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.109> last<00:03:59.290> example<00:03:59.609> what

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
workout here's my one last example what

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.339 
workout here's my one last example what
I<00:04:00.639> did<00:04:00.879> was<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.150> took<00:04:01.180> two<00:04:01.599> bands<00:04:01.930> because<00:04:02.229> I

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
I did was I took two bands because I

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.899 
I did was I took two bands because I
want<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.560> show<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.919> mobility<00:04:03.280> doesn't

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
want to show you that mobility doesn't

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.219 
want to show you that mobility doesn't
just<00:04:04.349> isolate<00:04:05.349> itself<00:04:05.799> to<00:04:07.079> joints<00:04:08.079> it

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
just isolate itself to joints it

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.259 
just isolate itself to joints it
definitely<00:04:09.069> applies<00:04:09.400> there's<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.669> mobility

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
definitely applies there's a mobility

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.420 
definitely applies there's a mobility

I<00:04:24.350> could<00:04:24.680> take<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.250> stretch<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:26.030> very

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
I could take it and stretch it very

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.810 
I could take it and stretch it very
easily<00:04:26.540> some<00:04:27.350> good<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:28.310> know<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:28.580> some

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.430 
easily some good you know there's some
good<00:04:29.000> motion<00:04:29.270> here<00:04:29.660> through<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:29.990> band<00:04:30.260> I've

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
good motion here through this band I've

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.290 
good motion here through this band I've
got<00:04:30.620> some<00:04:30.770> good<00:04:30.920> movement<00:04:31.130> whereas<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:31.940> cold

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
got some good movement whereas this cold

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.860 
got some good movement whereas this cold
band<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.870> definitely<00:04:33.830> am<00:04:34.040> pulling<00:04:34.550> feel<00:04:35.270> harder

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
band I definitely am pulling feel harder

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.650 
band I definitely am pulling feel harder
to<00:04:36.140> get<00:04:36.350> almost<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.430> much<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:37.910> can<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.240> still

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
to get almost as much if I can I still

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.420 
to get almost as much if I can I still
feel<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:38.990> don't<00:04:39.050> get<00:04:39.380> as<00:04:39.590> much<00:04:39.920> as<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.220> had

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
feel like I don't get as much as I had

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.730 
feel like I don't get as much as I had
on<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:41.150> other<00:04:41.330> band<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.690> matter<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:41.960> fact<00:04:42.230> this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
on the other band a matter of fact this

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.150 
on the other band a matter of fact this
band<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.340> even<00:04:43.670> fraying<00:04:44.120> as<00:04:44.420> I<00:04:45.140> do<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.530> a<00:04:45.770> nice

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
band is even fraying as I do this a nice

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.310 
band is even fraying as I do this a nice
cold<00:04:46.460> band<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:47.270> actually<00:04:47.600> starting<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.900> fray

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
cold band it's actually starting to fray

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.310 
cold band it's actually starting to fray
on<00:04:48.590> its<00:04:49.310> edges<00:04:49.730> and<00:04:50.450> you<00:04:50.870> can't<00:04:51.140> really<00:04:51.230> see

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
on its edges and you can't really see

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.780 
on its edges and you can't really see
from<00:04:51.620> there<00:04:51.770> but<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.310> edges<00:04:52.610> are<00:04:52.670> actually

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
from there but the edges are actually

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.270 
from there but the edges are actually
starting<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.270> come<00:04:53.420> up<00:04:53.540> and<00:04:53.690> Fred<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.070> can

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
starting to come up and Fred so you can

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.090 
starting to come up and Fred so you can
see<00:04:55.490> that<00:04:56.060> trying<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.020> take<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.560> cold<00:04:57.890> muscle

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
see that trying to take a cold muscle

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.510 
see that trying to take a cold muscle
and<00:04:58.750> work<00:04:59.750> with<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.140> can<00:05:00.470> be<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.590> bad<00:05:00.830> idea<00:05:01.040> so

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
and work with it can be a bad idea so

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.710 
and work with it can be a bad idea so
you<00:05:01.880> want<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.150> make<00:05:02.270> sure<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:02.570> you're

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
you want to make sure that you're

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.920 
you want to make sure that you're

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
through ranges of motion you may not be

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.230 
through ranges of motion you may not be
used<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.710> going<00:05:40.100> through<00:05:40.220> and<00:05:40.490> by<00:05:40.850> going

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.500 
through those ranges of motion either
during<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.250> warm-up<00:05:43.670> or<00:05:43.850> during<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.300> actual

during the warm-up or during the actual
exercise<00:05:44.840> itself<00:05:45.470> you're<00:05:45.890> going<00:05:45.920> to<00:05:46.160> be

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
exercise itself you're going to be

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.850 
exercise itself you're going to be
improving<00:05:46.820> your<00:05:46.970> mobility<00:05:47.300> which<00:05:48.080> will<00:05:48.290> have

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
improving your mobility which will have

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.470 
improving your mobility which will have
an<00:05:49.070> effect<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.490> improving<00:05:49.820> your<00:05:49.880> flexibility

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
an effect of improving your flexibility

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.240 
an effect of improving your flexibility
because<00:05:50.780> if<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.110> have<00:05:51.350> good<00:05:51.590> flexibility

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
because if you have good flexibility

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.620 
because if you have good flexibility
you're<00:05:52.670> finally<00:05:53.030> going<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.270> be<00:05:53.360> able<00:05:53.420> to

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
you're finally going to be able to

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.110 
you're finally going to be able to
express<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:54.290> by<00:05:54.830> having<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.280> more<00:05:55.430> mobile<00:05:55.760> joint

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
express it by having a more mobile joint

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.180 
express it by having a more mobile joint
that<00:05:56.480> these<00:05:56.660> muscles<00:05:57.080> cross<00:05:57.350> I<00:05:57.650> hope<00:05:58.010> that

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
that these muscles cross I hope that

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.870 
that these muscles cross I hope that
makes<00:05:58.340> sense

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
makes sense
