 "Whole Beets vs. Beet Juice to Improve Sports Performance" 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.940
 Our view of nitrates, concentrated in green leafy vegetables and beets, 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.130
 a few years ago has undergone a major transformation 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.380
 - from inert compounds to deep-acting substances 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.490
 to energy producing organelles found in all our cells 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.240
 as they reduce oxygen consumption during physical exercise, 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.300
 which means we can achieve the same performance with less oxygen. 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.770
 So a small glass of beet juice allows divers without oxygen 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 hold your breath for more than four minutes. That means about half a minute longer. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.930
 And other athletes improve muscle efficiency 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.879
 allows you to exercise with higher performance 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.399
 or running speed at the same breath volume. 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.300
 I have dealt with this discovery in an unprecedented one 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.210
 17-part video series, I think it was the longest I've ever done. 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.789
 It was so fascinating. But that was in 2012. 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.609
 What has happened since then? 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.489
 Many athletes, whether elite or amateur, 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 it began to drink beet juice before the races. 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.730
 But what do the latest scientific findings say? 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.730
 Most studies were done in men. 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.360
 It also works for women, even women of African-American 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 demographic research is even more neglected. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.780
 Same load performance with significantly lower oxygen consumption 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 after drinking beet juice. But forget about the beet juice. 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.420
 What beetroot whole? 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.750
 Cheaper, healthier, in every vegetable shop 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 but so far no studies have been conducted on beet whole, hitherto. 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.820
 Eating whole beetroot improved immediate running performance. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 They gave physically fit men and women 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.920
 one and a half cup of roast beets, which is the amount of one canned beet 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.009
 75 minutes before the start of the 5 kilometer race. 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.719
 They started the same, but during the last sixteen hundred meters of the race 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.310
 the group that received the beet overtake the placebo group 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 where runners got some berry instead. 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.140
 Although they ran faster, their heart rate did not increase. 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.360
 If anything, the beet group reported less effort. 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.700
 Faster time with less effort? 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.890
 Not for nothing it is said that beets are good for strength. 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.320
 But if nitrates are so beneficial, why not use them in pills 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250
 such as nitrate supplements, named for example as "infernal fire". 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.660
 While they can work, their long-term safety is questionable. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.950
 Nitrates from a source other than vegetables may have a health hazard. 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.450
 So if we want to improve our performance, 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.190
 we should really ideally obtain nitrates from whole vegetables. 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.140
 Industry knows, but instead recommends a palette 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.320
 supplements that stimulate nitric oxide production. 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.910
 However, there is little or no evidence 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 o Improving performance after administration of the products 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.280
 with these so-called NO supplements. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.040
 Vegetable has proven influence. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.120
 But how much can companies earn on beet sales? 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.900
 So what about a novelty - beet enriched bread? 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.230
 We tried to get people to eat fruits and vegetables 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.700
 and where did we get? 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.710
 A lot of people eat white bread. 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.710
 So why not give them red bread? 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.210
 And it really worked. 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.820
 Red beet bread lowers blood pressure 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.510
 improves the ability of the arteries to relax and naturally dilate. 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.400
 Thus, bread can be an effective means, 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.330
 how to increase the consumption of vegetables without significant dietary changes. 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.760
 Just so people don't have to 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.000
 change your diet to improve your health.
