so<00:00:06.040> the<00:00:06.279> steps<00:00:06.669> we<00:00:06.939> take<00:00:07.120> steps<00:00:07.809> if<00:00:08.109> your<00:00:08.290> foots

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:08.469 
so the steps we take steps if your foots

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:09.869 
so the steps we take steps if your foots
on<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.679> brake<00:00:08.860> yeah<00:00:09.099> go<00:00:09.309> ahead<00:00:09.400> and<00:00:09.580> turn<00:00:09.730> the

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879 
on the brake yeah go ahead and turn the

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.199 
on the brake yeah go ahead and turn the
key<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:11.610> turn<00:00:12.610> it<00:00:12.730> all<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.849> way<00:00:12.910> like<00:00:13.150> you're

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:13.209 
key and turn it all the way like you're

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.910 
key and turn it all the way like you're
going<00:00:13.359> to<00:00:13.420> start<00:00:13.689> the<00:00:13.809> engine<00:00:14.080> all<00:00:14.740> right

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
going to start the engine all right

going to start the engine all right
there<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:15.189> go<00:00:15.400> and<00:00:15.580> let<00:00:15.699> go<00:00:15.820> of<00:00:15.939> it<00:00:16.029> yeah<00:00:16.270> and

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
there you go and let go of it yeah and

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.099 
there you go and let go of it yeah and
that<00:00:17.019> last<00:00:17.230> red<00:00:17.590> circle<00:00:18.010> you'll<00:00:18.160> see<00:00:18.400> now

brake<00:00:21.460> off<00:00:21.580> yep<00:00:21.850> because<00:00:21.970> we<00:00:22.240> don't<00:00:22.480> have<00:00:22.600> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
brake off yep because we don't have a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.720 
brake off yep because we don't have a
party<00:00:23.080> trick<00:00:23.110> right<00:00:23.380> now<00:00:23.500> drive<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.520> your

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.500 

that's<00:00:34.280> never<00:00:34.520> going<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.910> get<00:00:35.030> old<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.480> know

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
that's never going to get old you know

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.080 
that's never going to get old you know
oh<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:35.900> know<00:00:36.170> isn't<00:00:36.380> that<00:00:36.470> fun<00:00:36.739> just

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
oh I know isn't that fun just

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.750 
oh I know isn't that fun just
acceleration<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.780> mean<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.470> have<00:00:40.309> driven<00:00:40.550> a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
acceleration and I mean I have driven a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.280 
acceleration and I mean I have driven a
Tesla<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.300> I<00:00:41.390> think<00:00:41.600> that's<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.200> know

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
Tesla and I think that's the you know

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.080 
Tesla and I think that's the you know

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
us a little bit about the difference in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.540 
us a little bit about the difference in
battery<00:00:53.900> structure<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.010> have<00:00:55.160> set<00:00:55.400> up

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
battery structure that you have set up

the cylindrical and their battery pack
and<00:01:03.890> they<00:01:04.160> have<00:01:04.280> very<00:01:04.309> large<00:01:05.119> quantity<00:01:05.540> right

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
and they have very large quantity right

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.389 
and they have very large quantity right
they<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:06.140> over<00:01:06.380> almost<00:01:06.680> 7,000

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
batteries tied into theirs what we've

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.600 
batteries tied into theirs what we've
done<00:01:09.259> is<00:01:09.560> worked<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:09.920> larger<00:01:10.220> format

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
done is worked with a larger format

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.060 
done is worked with a larger format

lithium-ion prismatic cell standardized
the<00:01:13.220> modules<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.119> can<00:01:14.240> put<00:01:14.360> them

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the modules so that we can put them

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.900 
the modules so that we can put them
across<00:01:14.600> our<00:01:14.990> whole<00:01:15.200> portfolio<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:16.100> vehicle<00:01:16.759> so

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
across our whole portfolio a vehicle so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.940 
across our whole portfolio a vehicle so
we've<00:01:17.060> standardized<00:01:17.509> now<00:01:17.720> on<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.590> module

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
we've standardized now on a on a module

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.139 
we've standardized now on a on a module
we<00:01:19.039> do<00:01:19.160> different<00:01:19.520> series<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:19.940> parallel

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
we do different series of parallel

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.880 
we do different series of parallel
combinations<00:01:20.899> work<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.380> nominal<00:01:21.770> voltage

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
combinations work to a nominal voltage

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.609 
combinations work to a nominal voltage
we<00:01:22.550> have<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.700> 380<00:01:23.119> bolt<00:01:23.360> nominal<00:01:24.110> voltage<00:01:24.200> on

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
we have a 380 bolt nominal voltage on

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.520 
we have a 380 bolt nominal voltage on
this<00:01:24.740> vehicle<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.240> therefore<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:26.990> have<00:01:27.200> 10

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
this vehicle and therefore we have 10

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.630 
this vehicle and therefore we have 10
modules<00:01:27.770> within<00:01:28.310> our

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
modules within our

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.550 
modules within our
so<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> failures<00:01:29.810> right<00:01:30.020> away<00:01:30.229> are

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so the failures right away are

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.250 
so the failures right away are
dramatically<00:01:31.550> reduced<00:01:32.030> over<00:01:32.690> something<00:01:33.140> that

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
dramatically reduced over something that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.840 
dramatically reduced over something that
you<00:01:33.320> would<00:01:33.440> experience<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.130> competitive

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
you would experience in a competitive

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.700 
you would experience in a competitive
product<00:01:35.360> such<00:01:35.659> as<00:01:35.690> Tesla<00:01:35.990> with<00:01:36.229> their<00:01:36.409> some

whether<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.790> real<00:01:49.940> drive<00:01:50.300> or<00:01:50.479> front<00:01:50.720> wheel

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
whether it's real drive or front wheel

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.450 
whether it's real drive or front wheel
drive<00:01:52.509> rear<00:01:53.509> visibility<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.040> little<00:01:55.250> tough

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
drive rear visibility is a little tough

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.270 
drive rear visibility is a little tough
it<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:55.909> we<00:01:56.360> do<00:01:56.450> need<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.830> look<00:01:57.830> at<00:01:57.950> improving

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
it is we do need to look at improving

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.580 
it is we do need to look at improving
that<00:01:58.430> package<00:01:58.970> final<00:01:59.450> when<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.750> come<00:02:00.380> through

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that package final when we come through

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.469 
that package final when we come through
obviously<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.009> battery<00:02:01.250> pack<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.789> charger

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
obviously the battery pack the charger

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.510 
obviously the battery pack the charger
we're<00:02:02.630> looking<00:02:02.840> at<00:02:02.960> will<00:02:03.140> improve<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.100> we'll

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
we're looking at will improve and we'll

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.670 
we're looking at will improve and we'll
get<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.789> site<00:02:05.119> down<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.720> little<00:02:05.869> bit<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:06.560> it

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
get that site down a little bit but it

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.070 
get that site down a little bit but it
is<00:02:06.800> pretty<00:02:07.550> narrow<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.880> begin<00:02:08.119> with<00:02:08.300> right<00:02:08.720> so

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
is pretty narrow to begin with right so

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.930 
is pretty narrow to begin with right so
yeah<00:02:09.830> as<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.190> as<00:02:10.369> you're<00:02:10.519> working<00:02:10.670> on

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
yeah as you as you're working on

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.030 
yeah as you as you're working on
redesigning<00:02:11.269> used<00:02:11.900> talked<00:02:12.200> about<00:02:12.470> safety

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
redesigning used talked about safety

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
redesigning used talked about safety
team<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.430> talk<00:02:13.610> about<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.940> charger<00:02:14.450> like

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
team you talk about the charger like

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.900 
team you talk about the charger like
what<00:02:15.709> are<00:02:15.980> some<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.400> steps<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.790> are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
what are some of the steps that are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.640 
what are some of the steps that are
going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> happen<00:02:17.300> now<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.720> make<00:02:18.470> that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
going to happen now to make that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.430 
going to happen now to make that
refinement<00:02:20.050> actually<00:02:21.050> throughout<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
refinement actually throughout the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.320 
refinement actually throughout the
development<00:02:21.739> plan<00:02:21.890> we<00:02:22.130> have<00:02:22.280> many<00:02:23.090> vehicles

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
development plan we have many vehicles

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.490 
development plan we have many vehicles
planned<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:24.200> all<00:02:25.160> kinds<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:26.019> testing<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
planned for all kinds of testing but I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.020 
planned for all kinds of testing but I
mean<00:02:27.709> from<00:02:27.890> under<00:02:28.040> fragment<00:02:28.400> besides<00:02:28.670> doing

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
mean from under fragment besides doing

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360 
mean from under fragment besides doing
that<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> proving<00:02:29.600> grounds<00:02:30.190> testing<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.340> are

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that the proving grounds testing we are

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
that the proving grounds testing we are
doing<00:02:31.940> quite<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.180> bit<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.360> work<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> Dino<00:02:32.959> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
doing quite a bit of work in the Dino so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.990 
doing quite a bit of work in the Dino so
it<00:02:33.200> will<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.470> looking<00:02:33.709> at<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> inverter<00:02:34.700> but

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
it will be looking at the inverter but

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.390 
it will be looking at the inverter but
what<00:02:35.120> can<00:02:35.209> we<00:02:35.299> do<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.480> control<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.310> know

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
what can we do to control you know

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.039 
what can we do to control you know
frequency<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.150> comes<00:02:38.480> out<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> inverter

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
frequency that comes out of the inverter

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.979 
frequency that comes out of the inverter
some<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> power<00:02:40.010> into<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.989> leveling

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
some of the power into it and leveling

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.319 
some of the power into it and leveling
that<00:02:42.140> out<00:02:42.549> we<00:02:43.549> are<00:02:43.670> trying<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> see<00:02:44.180> what<00:02:44.269> we

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
that out we are trying to see what we

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.509 
that out we are trying to see what we
can<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:45.010> smooth<00:02:46.010> out<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.310> engine

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
can do to smooth out of me the engine

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.009 
can do to smooth out of me the engine
mounts<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.820> think<00:02:46.970> we've<00:02:47.090> we've<00:02:47.690> worked<00:02:47.900> on

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
mounts I think we've we've worked on

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.509 
mounts I think we've we've worked on
we'll<00:02:48.200> continue<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.650> look<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:48.920> refining<00:02:49.310> that

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
we'll continue to look at refining that

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.120 
we'll continue to look at refining that
maybe<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.030> move<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.739> but<00:02:51.739> there<00:02:51.920> are<00:02:52.010> other

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
maybe as we move on but there are other

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.860 
maybe as we move on but there are other
initiatives<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.700> place<00:02:52.880> by<00:02:53.120> our<00:02:53.209> nvh<00:02:53.570> team

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
initiatives in place by our nvh team

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.060 
initiatives in place by our nvh team
that<00:02:54.170> they're<00:02:54.320> looking<00:02:54.440> at<00:02:54.680> how<00:02:54.799> can<00:02:54.829> we

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
that they're looking at how can we

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.740 
that they're looking at how can we
better<00:02:55.310> refine<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.820> based<00:02:56.120> even<00:02:56.420> off<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.660> our

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
better refine that based even off of our

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.360 
better refine that based even off of our
experience<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.260> hybrid

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
experience with the hybrid

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.600 
experience with the hybrid
right<00:02:59.360> there<00:02:59.599> as<00:02:59.690> we<00:02:59.840> came<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> stop<00:03:00.590> yeah<00:03:01.580> I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
right there as we came to a stop yeah I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.270 
right there as we came to a stop yeah I
take<00:03:01.879> my<00:03:02.030> foot<00:03:02.209> off<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.569> gas<00:03:02.930> around<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.620> gas

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
take my foot off the gas around the gas

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.580 
take my foot off the gas around the gas
off<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.970> accelerator<00:03:05.290> whatever<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.409> correct

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
off the accelerator whatever the correct

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.759 
off the accelerator whatever the correct
terminology<00:03:06.799> is<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.430> TV<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:09.500> know<00:03:09.590> it

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
terminology is in a TV and you know it

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.410 
terminology is in a TV and you know it
felt<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.190> regenerative<00:03:10.970> brakes<00:03:11.269> are

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
felt like the regenerative brakes are

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.899 
felt like the regenerative brakes are
somethings<00:03:11.780> kicking<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.230> pretty<00:03:12.470> yes<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.549> sound

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
somethings kicking it pretty yes a sound

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.509 
somethings kicking it pretty yes a sound
and<00:03:14.150> that's<00:03:14.360> another<00:03:14.629> you<00:03:15.049> know<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
and that's another you know we have the

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.160 
and that's another you know we have the
region<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:17.000> adjustable<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.659> that's<00:03:17.989> something

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
region is adjustable so that's something

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.830 
region is adjustable so that's something
that<00:03:18.319> we<00:03:18.530> can<00:03:18.769> continue<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.480> refine<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.690> where

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that we can continue to refine and where

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.569 
that we can continue to refine and where
we<00:03:21.110> need<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.319> do<00:03:21.409> more<00:03:21.590> customer<00:03:22.159> synthesis

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
we need to do more customer synthesis

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.250 
we need to do more customer synthesis
really<00:03:22.879> to<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.060> make<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:24.079> mature

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
really to just make it a more mature

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.990 
really to just make it a more mature
product<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.159> very<00:03:25.400> strong<00:03:25.700> our

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
product we do a very strong our

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.839 
product we do a very strong our
aggressive<00:03:26.329> regen<00:03:27.170> on<00:03:27.319> right<00:03:27.560> now<00:03:27.819> but<00:03:28.819> I

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
aggressive regen on right now but I

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.610
