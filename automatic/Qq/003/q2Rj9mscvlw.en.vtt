00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810 
I could find a system to carry it
horizontal<00:00:51.530> instead<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.789> know

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

in my pocket something I prefer but
anyhow<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:04.710> anybody<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
anyhow on this so if anybody is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.940 
anyhow on this so if anybody is
wondering<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:08.149> set<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> clip<00:02:09.599> plate

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
wondering you can set the clip plate

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.190 
wondering you can set the clip plate
to<00:02:11.550> fit<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> will<00:02:13.770> carry<00:02:14.220> horizontal

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
to fit so it will carry horizontal

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.770 
to fit so it will carry horizontal
hopefully<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.410> helps<00:02:17.150> again<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.330> really

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
hopefully that helps again it's really

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.540 
hopefully that helps again it's really
really<00:02:19.140> strong<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.660> coming<00:02:21.989> off<00:02:22.550> you

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
know it's a little loose if you can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.210 
know it's a little loose if you can
handle<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.980> nice<00:02:26.190> because

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
handle it that way but it's nice because
