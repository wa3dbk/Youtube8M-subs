00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 for those looking for a device 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.530
 photo at a time full is really 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.160
 compact panasonic offers the lumix tz6 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.320
 60 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
 we took in hand this device which 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.680
 is full of features but who 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.680
 is not without some flaws 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.980
 the lumix tz6 60 is not very 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 bulky it weighs only 2 142 g 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.399
 and yet he has all the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 characteristics of a higher device 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.829
 of range is big at all and its zoom 30 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.610
 times it is completely retractable 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.410
 fast and accurate associated with a good 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 image stabilizer it is really 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 performing on the back side we find 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.149
 a large, clear and bright screen we would have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 just appreciated that it's tactile the dz 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 60 also offers an electronic viewfinder 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.230
 which is rare on compacts especially 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 with a dioptric correction 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 unfortunately he is too small and not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.170
 a sharpness in the end it does not serve 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.489
 not much 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.729
 thanks to the wheel it is easy to access 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.810
 at the main manual settings a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.810
 fifteen or so filters 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.420
 there is a sweep panorama function 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 the tzen 60 also offers 18 scene modes 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 obviously there are the great classics 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 like landscape or sport mode but 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.899
 also other nice features 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.119
 like the hdr that improves the 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.130
 contrast of the image or the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.649
 creation directly on the device from 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 slow motion video footage up to 200 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.929
 images per second in low resolution 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.939
 a pity, however, that the interface of 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.799
 menus are also ugly 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.479
 the great originality of the thesis of 60 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.849
 it's this control ring around 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.459
 the goal that allows one to change one's 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.500
 part in m it can thus according to the cases 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:04.530
 quickly access different modes 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 scenes or at the filter pallet in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.369
 automatic 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 it will be used to zoom in steps 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.890
 and in manual mode 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.190
 it allows to change the opening of the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.170
 diaphragm the strengths of the theseus of 60 do 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.940
 not stop there he also records at 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.940
 raw format which is not so common 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.680
 on compact devices and at the level 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 connectivity difficult to do 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.770
 more complete it can connect to the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.230
 wifi a smartphone 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 in addition the pair h is easily done in 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.880
 nfc or thanks to qr code 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 and with the GPS sensor we can 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.799
 geotagging the photos includes if these 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.329
 equipment places it above the lot in 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.750
 contrast in terms of the quality of 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.329
 pics 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.760
 he's just about average 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.250
 18 megapixel sensor associated with its 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.310
 Leica optics make it possible to obtain 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 correct quality photos without more 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.569
 luckily autofocus him is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.489
 performing even in low light 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 last point the tzen 60 would have deserved 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.540
 the presence of a claw accessories that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.489
 In particular, it would make it possible to add 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.220
 external flash because the one that integrate it 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.310
 sorely lacking power 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.019
 on paper the panasonic lumix tz6 60 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.900
 seems to be the compact camera 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.220
 ideal but in reality there is when 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 even some problematic issues 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.200
 especially in terms of the quality of 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.239
 the image 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.000
 and then there is its price you have to count 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.689
 about 350 euros which is far from 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 negligible 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.439
 you can find the results of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.439
