00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.069
 friends welcome in this short video 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 I want to tell you about bluetooth 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.960
 jabra bt 2045 headset 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:17.010
 on of the most budget jabra headsets with 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 this and popular that's why I want not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 tell because it serves 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.939
 attention for the price how much it costs 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 it's around 700 800 rubles you get 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.640
 very good bluetooth headset 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 here are the main characteristics 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 well that's pure sound of course it's funny 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 write because there is still interference 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.620
 what is holding two devices 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 at the same time it makes it very convenient to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 actually works 8 hours in mode 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.260
 talk up to 10 days standby 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.920
 means bundled up bundled means 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.629
 Goes headset waste paper reklamka 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 and 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.670
 espichel cable to micro usb charger 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 no hold either off and surplus 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.149
 computer but better of course charger 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.670
 the device is well and the smartphone is like this 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.580
 she looks like this power button 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 shutdown 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 blinking blue that's it here here 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 Short specifications now focus 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.200
 the advantage of this headset works 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.200
 it is of course one more time to repeat its price 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.860
 focus doesn't want to tune 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.280
 its price means because but for such 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.560
 money is great and more gills should 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200
 the manufacturer will repeat it 700-800 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.509
 rubles just lucky it is what keeps two 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.250
 devices again I repeat miss 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.229
 It means that it can be emphasized that she is very 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 uncomfortable very comfortable sitting in your ear here 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.390
 out of this, that is, for a long time I do not bear 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 straining the spirit that's what isn't 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.149
 adjusting the sound one for someone this 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 the problem for someone isnt for me is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.530
 no problem charging her eternal micro 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.130
 very comfortably 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.049
 accordingly, the range is standard 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.439
 bluetooth around the apartment be like there in 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.600
 car college notebooks no question sound 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.130
 good well, like 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.860
 everywhere that is no such special 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.860
 clean there it is not written here here 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.810
 equipment also says that only 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.489
 no charging cable by the way now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.130
 for some reason, most charge headsets 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.800
 the end of the set well, respectively, here 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.440
 what else to say about it can be used 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 for the money you can not convenience 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 to suffer 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.280
 But this is the gill and this is the stability of the work 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.660
 reliability quality accordingly i would 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.819
 said that the best producer is not 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.819
 along with plantronics on one level 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.850
 design in principle is not very much so 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:55.790
 dumb or something so mediocre and not 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.530
 hightech and it looks decent 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 look you can use and not 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.410
 annoying that here but there is constantly 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.209
 will be a bluetooth headset all day 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.560
 then of course, here is another look 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.239
 but on the other hand the whole day is 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 unhealthy therefore and for 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.709
 conversations that is persuaded the department 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.890
 then they took this here inconvenience 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.299
 you can suffer is not critical a few 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.060
 volume control is also on the phone 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.359
 I like it do not require adjustment 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.790
 then ask the question what is 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.739
 I'm interested in telling everything 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.780
 I have experience with bluetooth headsets 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.120
 huge and and those every two to three months 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.630
 so I tried a lot of cheap 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.060
 Chinese 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.609
 to the most expensive models of the gills 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.760
 plantronics and therefore I understand them 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.049
 not by hearsay and now I do not see 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.180
 sense to overpay is one of mine 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.670
 I see no reason to overpay my headset 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.440
 huge money well because why 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.430
 if it works well and the inconvenience is not 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.799
 straining thanks for watching and waiting for your 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.700
 questions and comments 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.700
 likes everyone bye
