try and do this as quick as possible um

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.210 
try and do this as quick as possible um
ok<00:00:41.140> it's<00:00:41.260> easy<00:00:41.470> over<00:00:41.620> here<00:00:41.770> we<00:00:41.920> have<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.190> uh

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
ok it's easy over here we have to uh

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.120 
ok it's easy over here we have to uh
pretty<00:00:42.910> much<00:00:42.970> Twin<00:00:43.360> Towers<00:00:43.750> they're<00:00:44.620> circular

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
pretty much Twin Towers they're circular

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.680 
pretty much Twin Towers they're circular
I<00:00:45.160> try<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.400> mix<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:45.820> up<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:46.000> bit<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.360> circular

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
I try to mix it up a bit to the circular

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.480 
I try to mix it up a bit to the circular
and<00:00:46.900> I'm<00:00:47.230> probably<00:00:47.440> going<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.740> put<00:00:47.920> what<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
and I'm probably going to put what the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.760 
and I'm probably going to put what the
hell<00:00:49.140> every<00:00:50.140> once<00:00:50.320> in<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.470> while<00:00:50.560> I'm<00:00:50.620> probably

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
hell every once in a while I'm probably

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.530 
hell every once in a while I'm probably
going<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.040> put<00:00:51.160> like<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.310> little<00:00:51.400> bridge<00:00:52.120> that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
going to put like a little bridge that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.230 
going to put like a little bridge that
crosses<00:00:52.840> between<00:00:53.140> them<00:00:53.470> that'll<00:00:54.160> be<00:00:54.220> cool<00:00:54.400> um

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
crosses between them that'll be cool um

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.300 
crosses between them that'll be cool um
right<00:00:55.300> now<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:55.900> is<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.080> tallest<00:00:56.440> building<00:00:57.040> I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
ok so see here it's a very basic

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.280 
ok so see here it's a very basic
building<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.300> stopped<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.630> make<00:01:16.659> stairs<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.170> it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
building I stopped to make stairs in it

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.630 
building I stopped to make stairs in it
but<00:01:17.500> then<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.770> have<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.010> roof<00:01:18.159> up<00:01:18.280> here<00:01:18.460> which

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
but then you have the roof up here which

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.250 
but then you have the roof up here which
will<00:01:18.790> be<00:01:18.940> where<00:01:19.120> like<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.510> generators<00:01:20.080> and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
will be where like the generators and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.550 
will be where like the generators and
stuff<00:01:20.440> our<00:01:20.820> case<00:01:21.820> let's<00:01:22.000> go<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:22.270> here<00:01:22.600> we'll

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
stuff our case let's go down here we'll

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.050 
stuff our case let's go down here we'll
check<00:01:23.590> out<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.860> amusement<00:01:24.370> park<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:24.610> guess<00:01:24.640> or

another thing so you see here uh this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.490 
another thing so you see here uh this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
it's just a bunch of trees pretty much

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.789 
it's just a bunch of trees pretty much
and<00:01:39.400> um<00:01:40.080> what<00:01:41.080> took<00:01:41.229> me<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.440> little<00:01:41.560> while<00:01:41.650> and

here and they have two balconies on
either<00:03:23.840> side<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:25.310> yeah<00:03:25.760> there's

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
either side and you just yeah there's

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.670 
either side and you just yeah there's
two<00:03:26.450> rooms<00:03:26.660> per<00:03:26.870> level<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.290> there's<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.500> ten

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.949 
two rooms per level and there's like ten
levels<00:03:27.859> so<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> figure<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.690> pretty<00:03:29.840> big

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959
