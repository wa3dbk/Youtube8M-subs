multiple game is still becoming out on
the<00:00:44.370> Xbox<00:00:44.700> 720<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.020> expect<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> be

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the Xbox 720 so expect those two to be

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.760 
the Xbox 720 so expect those two to be
coming<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.460> pretty<00:00:47.730> much<00:00:47.820> release<00:00:48.149> day<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
coming out pretty much release day and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.959 
coming out pretty much release day and
expect<00:00:49.770> them<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.820> not

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
expect them to be right probably not

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
expect them to be right probably not
perfect<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.719> obviously<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.559> haven't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
perfect because obviously they haven't

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.010 
perfect because obviously they haven't
had<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> huge<00:00:53.430> amount<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
had a huge amount of time to get this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.229 
had a huge amount of time to get this
new<00:00:55.199> console<00:00:55.680> specs<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.699> perfect

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
new console specs and get it all perfect

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
new console specs and get it all perfect
but<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:57.989> they'll<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.620> don't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
but I think they'll be all right I don't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.779 
but I think they'll be all right I don't
think<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> next<00:00:59.370> walls<00:00:59.579> will<00:00:59.760> be

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
think the next walls will be

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
think the next walls will be
particularly<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.899> next

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
particularly good on this next

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
particularly good on this next
generation<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.070> we'll<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
generation but we'll see is going to be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
generation but we'll see is going to be
a<00:01:03.329> big<00:01:03.570> launch<00:01:03.809> title<00:01:04.350> hopefully<00:01:04.710> for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
a big launch title hopefully for

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
a big launch title hopefully for
Microsoft<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> goes<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.570> good

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
Microsoft so if it goes well that's good

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
Microsoft so if it goes well that's good
for<00:01:06.869> Microsoft<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.220> too

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
for Microsoft but I'm not really too

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060 
for Microsoft but I'm not really too
convinced<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> moment<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.380> yeah<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
fussed about getting a next-generation

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
fussed about getting a next-generation
consoles<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.710> perfectly<00:01:50.159> honest

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
consoles but you know perfectly honest

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.030 
consoles but you know perfectly honest
I'd<00:01:50.700> rather<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.390> stick<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.750> 360<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.680> maybe

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I'd rather just stick my 360 for maybe

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
I'd rather just stick my 360 for maybe
another<00:01:53.159> year<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.180> wait<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> new

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
another year or so then wait for the new

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
another year or so then wait for the new
consoles<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> come<00:01:55.860> down<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> price<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.729> then

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
consoles to come down in price and then

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
consoles to come down in price and then
I<00:01:57.210> might<00:01:57.450> consider<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.710> not

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I might consider it but really I'm not

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
I might consider it but really I'm not
too<00:01:59.399> fast<00:01:59.610> whatsoever<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.479> might<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.140> stick

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
too fast whatsoever I might just stick

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
too fast whatsoever I might just stick
my<00:02:01.409> pc<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.860> upgrade<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.729> honest

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
my pc and upgrade that to be honest

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
my pc and upgrade that to be honest
because<00:02:03.030> pcs<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.960> upgrade<00:02:04.110> every<00:02:04.560> year

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
because pcs you can upgrade every year

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590 
because pcs you can upgrade every year
and<00:02:04.890> consoles<00:02:05.340> only<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:06.090> upgraded<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and consoles only get upgraded like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
and consoles only get upgraded like
every<00:02:06.810> 10<00:02:07.079> years<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.160> know<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.520> my

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
every 10 years so you know that's my

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.790 
every 10 years so you know that's my
that's<00:02:09.209> my<00:02:09.330> thinking<00:02:09.660> behind<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.530> if

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that's my thinking behind it all but if

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's my thinking behind it all but if
you<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.489> yet<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you are going to get in yet a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.680 
you are going to get in yet a
next-generation<00:02:12.150> console<00:02:12.629> let<00:02:12.750> me<00:02:12.870> know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
next-generation console let me know

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.960 
next-generation console let me know
but<00:02:14.440> yeah<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.590> really<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> know<00:02:15.220> are<00:02:15.820> there

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
that sort of lines but i don't think i

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.280 
that sort of lines but i don't think i
will<00:02:45.460> sadly<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.180> another<00:02:46.360> project<00:02:46.630> gotham<00:02:46.900> but
