00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.150
 in so far this year 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.640
 the article is short 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.580
 kiki state 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.480
 I love you this day 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.970
 emphasize a website 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.280
 it's like a book 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.590
 and a web page 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 It's like a sheet a page inside that site 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.280
 then I want to say of a site 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 montevideo augustine many percent pages as long as the owner 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.580
 in that respect 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.600
 Many pages 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.870
 inside him 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.380
 and if you start thinking and style 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.580
 many pages in the country 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
 in fact this video with everything that you see around 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 video the american garden 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.250
 it's a single page 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.860
 and therefore the cantaor your video 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.500
 another page is made the player taking of roads has created bolatti in it is 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.390
 she 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.650
 and that's how 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.390
 2 that's all they're going to learn 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.400
 you have to prove that today so hopefully this has helped 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.140
 understand modestly and crystal 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.499
 structured 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:11.949
 on the pages 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.249
 In Internet 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.549
 many a page can contain nothing more than two letters 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.119
 nothing else can be seen in the picture that would be a patrol 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.239
 but you should always observe this Sunday 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.239
 domain is written usually that up 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.469
 it can be dot com 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.459
 a barrel 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.609
 point for him 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.499
 in many others the look of the north 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:41.339
 the countries also good then if that domain observers perez that

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.729
 and that those kids that your website 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.049
