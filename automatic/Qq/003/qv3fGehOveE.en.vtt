00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

the<00:00:00.120> cost<00:00:00.390> of<00:00:00.630> ignoring<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:01.170> destructive

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
the cost of ignoring a destructive

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.780 
the cost of ignoring a destructive
pattern<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:02.460> you're<00:00:02.580> going<00:00:02.730> to

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
pattern is that you're going to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.820 
pattern is that you're going to
self-destruct<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.750> will<00:00:03.929> implode<00:00:04.529> rather

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
self-destruct you will implode rather

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.919 
self-destruct you will implode rather
than<00:00:05.009> explode<00:00:08.330> my<00:00:09.330> training<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.750> as<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
than explode my training is as a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.200 
than explode my training is as a
neurologist<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.710> I've<00:00:10.830> spent<00:00:11.179> well<00:00:12.179> over

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
neurologist so I've spent well over

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.539 
neurologist so I've spent well over
three<00:00:12.630> decades<00:00:12.750> studying<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.250> nervous

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
three decades studying how the nervous

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.080 
three decades studying how the nervous
system<00:00:15.059> organizes<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.960> information<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
system organizes this information and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.250 
system organizes this information and
it's<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.359> quite<00:00:18.539> interesting<00:00:18.720> when<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's really quite interesting when you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.230 
it's really quite interesting when you
look<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> fact<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.430> even<00:00:21.119> though

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
look at the fact that really even though

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240 
look at the fact that really even though
we<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.720> having<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.199> brain<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.920> actually

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we think of having one brain we actually

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580 
we think of having one brain we actually
have<00:00:23.369> three<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.850> brains<00:00:24.320> we<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.439> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
have three different brains we have this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
have three different brains we have this
very<00:00:25.920> primitive<00:00:26.400> brain<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:27.510> people

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
very primitive brain which some people

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050 
very primitive brain which some people
call<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> reptilian<00:00:28.680> brain<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.029> look

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
call the reptilian brain and if you look

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060 
call the reptilian brain and if you look
at<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> reptile<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> crocodile<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
at a reptile look at a crocodile it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.250 
at a reptile look at a crocodile it
really<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.640> two<00:00:32.880> responses<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.020> off

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
really just has two responses on or off

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.889 
really just has two responses on or off
so<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> ever<00:00:35.309> watched<00:00:35.610> our<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.059> crocodile

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so if you ever watched our a crocodile

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.810 
so if you ever watched our a crocodile
trying<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> eat<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> wildebeest<00:00:38.070> seems<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> be

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
trying to eat a wildebeest seems to be

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
trying to eat a wildebeest seems to be
very<00:00:38.850> quiet<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> suddenly<00:00:39.899> explodes<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
very quiet and suddenly explodes and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.430 
very quiet and suddenly explodes and
then<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> goes<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:42.000> its<00:00:42.300> quiet<00:00:43.020> state

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
then it goes back into its quiet state

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
then it goes back into its quiet state
so<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> response<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.660> basic

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so that response is really a very basic

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
so that response is really a very basic
survival<00:00:46.710> response<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> mammalian

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
survival response but the mammalian

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
survival response but the mammalian
brain<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.410> sometimes<00:00:50.190> known<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
brain which is sometimes known as the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
brain which is sometimes known as the
limbic<00:00:50.969> brain<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.809> created<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.590> modulating

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
limbic brain has created a modulating

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
limbic brain has created a modulating
effect<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.149> reptilian<00:00:54.510> brain<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
effect on that reptilian brain so the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.849 
effect on that reptilian brain so the
limbic<00:00:56.340> system<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:57.239> brought<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.469> very

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
limbic system has brought into this very

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
limbic system has brought into this very
primitive<00:00:59.190> on/off<00:00:59.699> response<00:01:00.199> gradations

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
primitive on/off response gradations

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.009 
primitive on/off response gradations
meaning<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.789> on

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
meaning you can be a little bit on

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
meaning you can be a little bit on
significantly<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.700> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
significantly on really on but then on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
significantly on really on but then on
top<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.390> mammalian<00:01:06.750> brain<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.470> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
top of that mammalian brain really just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
top of that mammalian brain really just
for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> last<00:01:08.220> couple<00:01:08.430> hundred<00:01:08.820> thousand

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
for the last couple hundred thousand

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
for the last couple hundred thousand
years<00:01:09.420> we've<00:01:09.630> evolved<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.650> human<00:01:11.070> brain<00:01:11.280> which

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
years we've evolved as human brain which

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
years we've evolved as human brain which
is<00:01:11.850> called<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.170> neocortex<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.320> you'll<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
is called the neocortex and you'll be a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
is called the neocortex and you'll be a
new<00:01:14.100> cortex<00:01:14.700> new<00:01:14.939> covering<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> brain<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
new cortex new covering of the brain and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
new cortex new covering of the brain and
that<00:01:17.100> actually<00:01:17.460> allows<00:01:17.729> us<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> first

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that actually allows us for the first

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
that actually allows us for the first
time<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.049> evolutionary<00:01:19.619> history<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.189> decide

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
time in evolutionary history to decide

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.520 
time in evolutionary history to decide
whether<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> react<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.409> all

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
whether or not we want to react at all

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
whether or not we want to react at all
if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.369> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.700> brain<00:01:24.000> scans<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.869> can

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
if we look at brain scans we can

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
if we look at brain scans we can
actually<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> traumatized<00:01:26.369> brain<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
actually see in a traumatized brain this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually see in a traumatized brain this
part<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> brain<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> shutting<00:01:28.799> down

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
part of the brain kind of shutting down

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
part of the brain kind of shutting down
becoming<00:01:29.549> dark<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.180> part<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> brain<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
becoming dark the part of the brain that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.100 
becoming dark the part of the brain that
is<00:01:31.680> associated<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.430> emotions<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> part

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
is associated with emotions is that part

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
is associated with emotions is that part
you<00:01:34.500> might<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.829> familiar<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> fight<00:01:35.790> or

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you might be familiar with the fight or

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960 
you might be familiar with the fight or
flight<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.479> freeze<00:01:36.869> response<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> amygdala

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
flight or freeze response the amygdala

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
flight or freeze response the amygdala
which<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> fear<00:01:39.780> processing<00:01:40.530> center<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
which is the fear processing center in

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
which is the fear processing center in
this<00:01:41.250> part<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> brain<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.869> becomes

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
this part of the brain really becomes

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.929 
this part of the brain really becomes
bright<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:45.119> happens<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.869> trauma<00:01:46.939> changes

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
bright so what happens is trauma changes

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
bright so what happens is trauma changes
brain<00:01:48.240> functioning<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> triggers

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
brain functioning and then that triggers
