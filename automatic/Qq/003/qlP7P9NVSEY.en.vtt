getting<00:04:26.200> tax<00:04:26.500> dollars<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.890> do<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.220> same<00:04:27.430> thing

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
cited the fact that all these craft

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.560 
cited the fact that all these craft

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
do a fast changing pattern means that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.630 
do a fast changing pattern means that
they're<00:04:54.940> experiencing<00:04:55.710> perhaps<00:04:56.710> tens<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.340> G's

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
they're experiencing perhaps tens of G's

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.140 
they're experiencing perhaps tens of G's
inside<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.660> craft<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.620> was<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> normal

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
inside the craft if it was a normal

but<00:05:05.500> what's<00:05:06.220> obvious<00:05:06.669> is<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.880> they<00:05:07.150> do<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.419> so

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
but what's obvious is that they do it so

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.630 
but what's obvious is that they do it so
effortlessly<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:08.590> can<00:05:08.740> change<00:05:08.979> direction<00:05:09.370> so

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
effortlessly and can change direction so

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.969 
effortlessly and can change direction so
quickly<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.210> very<00:05:11.140> likely<00:05:11.380> they're<00:05:11.770> not

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
quickly that very likely they're not

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.770 
quickly that very likely they're not
