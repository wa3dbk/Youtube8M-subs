00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey people new technique exercises for you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.580
 Today and I will show you today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 how to swim the old German properly 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 exercise you have already determined all times 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.889
 heard or most of you and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 Although it is simply an exercise that leads 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.570
 my back on out with one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 back double arm and the whole 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.430
 paired with a breastbone blow in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 supine sounds something like this first 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 funny it is a bit too 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.779
 more creative technique exercise but you can 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.340
 so that several technical aspects 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 For one, it is one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.450
 Coordinative exercises because you just one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.129
 Toads double in the evening with a big one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 first hit together 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 but at the same time it trains too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 the explosive impulse for the poor to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.120
 under water just for a vigorous 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.379
 pressure phase and you just have to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 always keep the body tension otherwise 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 are just the water situation extremely off and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.590
 I'll just show you the whole thing now 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.590
 let's see if it's the same 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.030
 such it has been seen quite well 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.049
 It makes you feel right a few times 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.759
 fast with it 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.689
 I think the exercise is pretty 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.330
 fun and now has little note is 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.530
 Of course, the exercise that very much 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.959
 good for agility in the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.380
 shoulder joint is just that one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.120
 not with the longitudinal axis and the arm does 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.519
 with rotates but always star in one 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.750
 level stays that way and you just have to go here 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.720
 work more 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.150
 It promotes agility 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.510
 We swimmers if only now 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.610
 I'm looking for high-quality video 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.989
 I liked my other technique 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.989
 videos on and see you soon
