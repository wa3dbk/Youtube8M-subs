00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
probably because either the shape isn't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.390 
probably because either the shape isn't
supposed<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> fit<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.950> cast<00:01:20.189> is

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
so we have a few things different from

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.050 
so we have a few things different from
the<00:05:04.660> feel<00:05:04.990> better<00:05:05.260> kit<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.370> wheelchair

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
the feel better kit but the wheelchair

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.659 
the feel better kit but the wheelchair
seems<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.660> same<00:05:07.979> wheelchair<00:05:08.979> but<00:05:09.190> they<00:05:09.520> both

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
seems the same wheelchair but they both

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.180 
seems the same wheelchair but they both
have<00:05:09.940> back<00:05:10.150> wheels<00:05:10.539> they<00:05:11.289> have<00:05:11.440> front<00:05:11.949> wheels

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
have back wheels they have front wheels

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.490 
have back wheels they have front wheels
they<00:05:12.520> have<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.789> footrest<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:14.199> they<00:05:14.349> have

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
they have that footrest and they have

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.020 
they have that footrest and they have
the<00:05:14.650> seat<00:05:14.919> in<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.190> back<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.639> course<00:05:15.820> the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
the seat in the back of course the

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.420 
the seat in the back of course the
handles<00:05:16.599> so<00:05:17.139> it<00:05:17.289> looks<00:05:17.530> like<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.889> same<00:05:18.160> but

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
handles so it looks like the same but

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.920 
handles so it looks like the same but
I'm<00:05:18.550> pretty<00:05:18.789> sure<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.240> American<00:05:19.750> girl

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
I'm pretty sure the American girl

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.980 
I'm pretty sure the American girl
wheelchairs<00:05:20.650> are<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:21.849> much<00:05:22.270> better<00:05:22.479> quality

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
wheelchairs are a much better quality

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.860 
wheelchairs are a much better quality
than<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.380> because<00:05:23.849> they<00:05:24.849> wouldn't<00:05:25.120> be<00:05:25.210> maybe

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
than this because they wouldn't be maybe

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.140 
than this because they wouldn't be maybe
Alex<00:05:26.500> they<00:05:26.919> probably<00:05:27.340> wouldn't<00:05:27.760> be<00:05:27.910> so

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
Alex they probably wouldn't be so

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.029 
Alex they probably wouldn't be so
expensive<00:05:28.539> if<00:05:29.169> there<00:05:29.500> wasn't<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.889> better

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
expensive if there wasn't a better

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.029 
expensive if there wasn't a better
quality<00:05:30.729> not<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.870> mention<00:05:32.110> this<00:05:32.530> whole<00:05:32.770> set

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
quality not to mention this whole set

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.230 
quality not to mention this whole set
