 any housewife as they say to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 inside my chocolate I'm going 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.890
 add a magic ingredient that a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 of my fetish ingredients it's water 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.969

 made of chocolate as I wanted 10 and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.219
 whipped cream and we forget about 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 often that whipped cream can be 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.789
 prepared in the front this can even be 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 prepared in the morning for the evening at 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.000
