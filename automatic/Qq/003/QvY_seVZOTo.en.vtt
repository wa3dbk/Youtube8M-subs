 guys and again here from fifa 16th to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.640
 people are back with a new system 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 of pass interception exactly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.860
 I'm going to comment to you here about this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 new future that is there in fifa 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.300
 16 people are so cool i'm going to explain 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.399
 here for you just how it works and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 you'll like too much in the fifa 15 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 new generation we had a great 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.100
 added that the mentalities of the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.020
 players that we can manage 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.879
 It's really the people there who set the team up. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 put it I want it to run 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 on the sides and go to the middle or 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.520
 I want the benzema to stay pivotal 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.559
 example in several options that you 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.740
 can put is to stay in position 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.240
 stay free and so on the galley 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.470
 who played you know what I'm talking about 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 it helps too much 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.150
 now lives there 16 he take the rape 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.850
 new level that is the interception of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.740
 passes in aggressive mode explains here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.570
 It's up to you how it works. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 Apparently it will be another 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 instruction inside the management 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.180
 of teams that you already know head 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 explain how it works and you saw in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.890
 screen also to be an option that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 You're active there and now we're going to the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 details on these new kicks he leaves the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.850
 game when the aggressive mode is activated 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.979
 player goes to the top of the ball without 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 think twice even if it is not the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 correct choice it goes at all costs 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 try to catch the ball we'll see 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.470
 this example that has on screen francisco 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.610
 who launched francisco that she does not know 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 How professional is it from him? 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.979
 anyway it is circulated there 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.540
 in red and the ball is yellow to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.960
 first image to view the ball being 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.219
 past he can see a chance to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.469
 you can see it and you're 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.930
 a bit far from the moment but he is so 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.879
 aggression that continues to try to get the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 ball moving some frames forward 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.210
 we can see that the moment we 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 the offensive player 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.170
 can leave with the ball which lan 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.850
 would be waiting for your neck in this 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.790
 occasion who takes the best and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.130
 can retrieve the ball into the arsenal 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.900
 but it was a risky approach 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.700
 It was very dangerous to have done this. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.640
 How can you see the interception 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.100
 aggressive will always think about winning the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.450
 ball does not matter if it is the most 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 appropriate to do 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.990
 so for example you are at 90 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 minutes from 2 to 1 you put the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.760
 team in offensive and ultra lets you 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.200
 aggressive passes interception 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.940
 everybody goes up 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.830
 in that madness and you're going to make a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.020
 unfortunate pressure that the opposing team 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.790
 can not get the ball there and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.890
 I managed to play fast basically 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.630
 happen is the guy got the ball now 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 It will run the same way it happens on this pitch. 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.130
 that is up aggressive even is 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.660
 this is an aggressive interception 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 at the moment it was dominating the ball the guy 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.920
 It's already behind, giving no space. 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.360
 only as it is said if you do not know how to use and 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.340
 in a good way 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.050
 this ultimately harm hurt 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.310
 I was able to play the exact time the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.020
 player runs running open defense 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.870
 so you have to know how to use wisely 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.180
 but it's going to be something great that goes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.650
 help in those crucial times. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.840
 within the field we also have 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.250
 Normal pass interception will 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.250
 work the way it is working 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.830
 now currently in the fifa 15 standard way 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.010
 he will try to intercept passes when 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.350
 chances are reasonable still says here 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.480
 in this image the instruction will be a 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.060
 value there is not going to be a value 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.400
 standard for all players except 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.140
 those who have the food then 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.970
 if you do not want the player to be 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.340
 this way without being there and changing 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.110
 otherwise he will play like this without any 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.390
 I do not know exactly how it goes 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.250
 work if this aggressive business only 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.900
 will be for some players who have 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.490
 this characteristic of being aggressive 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.780
 such as the player here of the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.310
 arsenal that we just talked about 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.030
 basically that's what i said to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.440
 you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.570
 the player will be totally aggressive 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.320
 trying to recover the ball and pressing 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.880
 the defense 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.850
 we also have the last option that will be 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.190
 the low pass interception player 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.470
 will only try to intercept the ball if he 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.360
 have a great opportunity to 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.430
 able to win the ball this instruction 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.370
 will be assigned to those players 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.470
 who are cautious and do not like to take 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.030
 many risks and will only try 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.380
 intercept the ball 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.870
 if you have a large 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.910
 chance to make eg sex 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.100
 factories beyond chelsea can be seen 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.080
 then the first image that the kingfisher 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 It's circled in blue with the ball in the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.770
 his foot playing there in defense of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.990
 liverpool we also have the jordan 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.490
 is also in blue that will receive the 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.500
 ball in the next frame we already 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.420
 can see when henderson can 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.520
 receive a lot of pressure from the three 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.860
 chelsea players visible in the image 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.530
 the cesc fabregas there circulate red 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.990
 is unwilling to give his position to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.610
 try to intercept the ball aggressively 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.500
 already the last image we can see 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.320
 by henderson is there playing the ball 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.540
 ahead and the factories continue in their 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.910
 place without making a pressure 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.920
 aggressive just want to stay there in her 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.170
 That's the big news I'm in. 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.290
 I thought it was great. 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.140
 option to create plays and create styles 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.970
 of games within matches for example 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.340
 He's a guy who likes to play there. 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.800
 keeping your players behind the middle 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.660
 not being aggressive, leaving the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.100
 opponent plays in his field there 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.730
 returning the ball and killing against the 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.230
 attack 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.480
 There is a player who likes to 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.010
 defense does not leave the opposing team there 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.690
 leave behind in the middle field and has 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.300
 normal players who like to leave the 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.160
 game run the normal way i'll talk 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.080
 For you, my tactic is the best. 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.360
 defense is the attack so if you do not 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.860
 let the opposing team attack the best 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.660
 thing is this you will only get pressure 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.100
 pressure there are people who 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.900
 likes to play defensive like 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.030
 expect the error of the opposing team and has 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.620
 Household cases do not depend on what you have 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.660
 facing the team cast 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.280
 opponent then you see how to play 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.620
 more defensive to let the guy really 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.420
 play in your field you can kill 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.550
 in some individual bid then this 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.620
 creates many chances and opportunities you 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.450
 to get out there on top of your 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.220
 opponent with various tactics there 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.990
 depending on your show in the game and 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.730
 departure is that what had 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.390
 To tell you about the video of 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.860

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.200
 I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.300
 I hope I explained it right here for 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.280
 about these new 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.840
 But that's it, leave it alone. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.920
 opinion here in the comments on what 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.230
 Did you think that? 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.300
 Did you like it? Did you hate it? 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.250
 leave the game very bad, commit underneath 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.750
 Do you want to know what you think? Do not forget. 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.460
 beauty then if you do not want to lose 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.840
 more videos about fifa said sign up 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.400
 in the channel is that there 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.510
 a big hug a lot we see in 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.260
 soon he spoke up more 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.260
 and was the
