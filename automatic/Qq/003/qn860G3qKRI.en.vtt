00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.599> positive<00:00:01.110> for<00:00:01.290> us<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.620> we<00:00:01.650> just

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I think the positive for us is we just

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.649 
I think the positive for us is we just
played<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> team<00:00:02.520> that's<00:00:02.730> similar<00:00:03.120> I'm<00:00:03.480> not

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
played a team that's similar I'm not

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:04.820 
played a team that's similar I'm not
saying<00:00:03.899> that<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.080> same<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.500> obviously

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
saying that the same and obviously

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.620 
saying that the same and obviously
Syracuse<00:00:05.400> has<00:00:05.609> earned<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.779> right<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.490> to<00:00:08.630> be

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
Syracuse has earned the right to to be

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.299 
Syracuse has earned the right to to be
considered<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.530> top<00:00:10.740> team<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.160> league

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
considered the top team in the league

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.490 
considered the top team in the league
right<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.550> given<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:11.969> they've<00:00:12.210> done<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
right now given what they've done in the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
right now given what they've done in the
playoffs<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.519> played<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> team<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.150> was

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
playoffs but we played a team that was

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.500 
playoffs but we played a team that was
very<00:00:15.420> similar<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.960> oak<00:00:16.139> City<00:00:16.760> in<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.940> sense<00:00:18.210> that

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
very similar in oak City in a sense that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.019 
very similar in oak City in a sense that
they<00:00:19.380> came<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:19.949> real<00:00:20.189> hard<00:00:20.430> Syracuse<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
they came out as real hard Syracuse is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.759 
they came out as real hard Syracuse is
going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> come<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.420> us<00:00:21.570> real<00:00:21.779> hard<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
going to come out us real hard so the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
going to come out us real hard so the
transition<00:00:23.400> will<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.580> easier<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
transition will be easier into this

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.450 
transition will be easier into this
series<00:00:24.869> than<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.140> was<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> Toronto<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
series than it was from the Toronto to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.880 
series than it was from the Toronto to
the<00:00:26.550> oak<00:00:26.670> city<00:00:26.939> sewers<00:00:27.529> but<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> mean<00:00:28.769> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the oak city sewers but I mean this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.800 
the oak city sewers but I mean this
series<00:00:29.220> starts<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.580> zero<00:00:29.789> zero<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.689> know

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
series starts at zero zero we know

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.209 
series starts at zero zero we know
they're<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> great<00:00:31.230> team<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:32.099> gonna

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
they're a great team and we're gonna

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.229 
they're a great team and we're gonna
have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> put<00:00:32.579> our<00:00:32.610> best<00:00:32.759> foot<00:00:32.969> forward

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
have to put our best foot forward

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
have to put our best foot forward
they're<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.660> gonna<00:00:33.809> care<00:00:34.380> who<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.649> beat<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
they're not gonna care who we beat and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.100 
they're not gonna care who we beat and
we<00:00:35.550> can't<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.180> either<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.719> think

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
we can't think about that either I think

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
we can't think about that either I think
we've<00:00:37.469> we've<00:00:37.920> been<00:00:38.190> through<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
we've we've been through a lot of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.150 
we've we've been through a lot of
adversity<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.739> playoffs

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
adversity I think this this playoffs

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.380 
adversity I think this this playoffs
we've<00:00:41.399> we've<00:00:41.700> played<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> games

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we've we've played a lot of games

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
we've we've played a lot of games
obviously<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.350> helped<00:00:43.620> us<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
obviously but I think that's helped us I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
obviously but I think that's helped us I
think<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.059> stage<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.629> think

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
think when you get to this stage I think

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
think when you get to this stage I think
you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> nobody's<00:00:47.399> tired<00:00:47.700> everyone<00:00:48.090> wants

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you know I nobody's tired everyone wants

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
you know I nobody's tired everyone wants
to<00:00:48.450> wants<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.530> everyone's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to wants to go and what everyone's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
to wants to go and what everyone's
really<00:00:50.100> excited<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
really excited so I think it's it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
really excited so I think it's it's
stuff<00:00:52.620> leaving<00:00:52.920> fun<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.370> hungry<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.850> want

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
your job and you go out you play and you

your job and you go out you play and you
enjoy<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> moment<00:01:20.280> yeah<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
enjoy the moment yeah I think the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
enjoy the moment yeah I think the
chemistry<00:01:22.229> starts<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> leadership<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
chemistry starts with the leadership and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
chemistry starts with the leadership and
I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.640> those<00:01:24.030> guys<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> veteran<00:01:24.810> guys<00:01:24.960> have

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
I think those guys the veteran guys have

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890 
I think those guys the veteran guys have
done<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> great<00:01:25.380> job<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.799> keeping<00:01:26.400> us<00:01:26.640> close<00:01:26.900> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
they've involved us and that this team

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.490 
they've involved us and that this team

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
has great chemistry and that's worth

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
Detroit he came out of college and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.510 
Detroit he came out of college and
stuffed<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.840> right<00:03:12.989> away<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.530> was<00:03:13.680> he<00:03:14.400> was

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520

a<00:03:14.550> huge<00:03:14.820> piece<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.300> us<00:03:15.390> up<00:03:15.570> there<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.020> until

he until he got hurt so I think there's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.760 
he until he got hurt so I think there's
no<00:03:19.020> reason<00:03:19.350> why<00:03:19.470> he<00:03:19.680> can't<00:03:19.950> come

excited<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.070> think<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:28.150> he

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
excited for it I think it's you know he

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.880 
excited for it I think it's you know he
is<00:03:28.570> obviously<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.990> really<00:03:29.110> good<00:03:29.320> player<00:03:29.590> he<00:03:29.710> can

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
is obviously a really good player he can

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.200 
is obviously a really good player he can
move<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.100> puck<00:03:30.220> well<00:03:30.490> he's<00:03:30.670> got<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> good<00:03:30.970> reach

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
move the puck well he's got a good reach

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.970 
move the puck well he's got a good reach
and<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.900> think<00:03:32.350> we're<00:03:32.440> going<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.620> feed<00:03:32.800> off<00:03:32.950> each

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
and I think we're going to feed off each

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.390 
and I think we're going to feed off each
other<00:03:33.280> pretty<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.550> I<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.950> had<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> pretty
