00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:15.370
 the expected because it was an album on 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.939
 which I felt the need to create a 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.930
 detachment and the most dilated periods of 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:26.590
 work compared to the previous album by 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:32.759
 cortona with a renewal but I took it 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 also a bit like a kind of rebirth 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.309
 there is also a need to live situations 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.309
 new that can stimulate you and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.739
 enrich so that maybe yours 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.769
 thought can also simply 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.760
 change of perspective because you live 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:57.940
 always of an eternal comparison 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:02.500
 I am a well deserved port for dinner 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.310
 this album is linked to several tracks 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.860
 because they all arrived with the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.640
 heart and having worked a lot 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.259
 to the writing of each of them are there 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.899
 I feel like they're all mine 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.390
 children for which the wait also a little 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.390
 speech of a birth 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.340
 I felt a strong need to expand 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.240
 times to arrive at a situation 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 new on this occasion I collaborated 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.950
 to writing together with linda perry that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 I joined her in her studio in Los 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 angeles and then also with the producer 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.179
 Israeli I arrive that I reached at 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.539
 london and the meeting with roberto 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.399
 casalino also there was born another song 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.350
 where I could also collaborate with the 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.229
 writing of the text and also together with 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.470
 arm to the goal which I had heard this 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.289
 song bearing the title whatever 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.350
 extraordinary life that I felt very much 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.959
 near a period of my life 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.640
 particular that I was living not by chance 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.860
 it is precisely the song that I then dedicated 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 to my father and my brother and also all 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.590
 people in situations 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.590
 not easy 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.330
 victoria is a fictional character but 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.900
 I was inspired precisely because I have 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 attended these three for some time 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 acrobat sisters working at the circus e 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 the circus lifestyle so has me 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.980
 inspired by a text of this type 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.830
 precisely open 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.070
 in the past how many said that not 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.830
 will not have had you so much a 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.650
 how much he deserves 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.380
 a very energetic song then 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.040
 true it makes me happy that there is this 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.540
 Arisa's mutual sympathy is also her 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.540
 he is a nice personaggino 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.730
 we'll see soon as a judge of xfactor 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.220
 but who knows but spurs in the next 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.470
 years hopefully you'd like to be able to 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.250
 concentrate so much on my path 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.709
 artistic and able to reach that type 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.519
 of goal at a time when I am 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.340
 quite consolidated also in the mine 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.670
 path is to be able to succeed also in 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.430
 make some investment too 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.319
 producing young people or writing for 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.300
 them why that's why I see him a 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.300
 little more projected into the future 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.450
 Yup 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.270
 a greeting from giusy ferreri to the fan page
