00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:41.910

 music and a guitar here has this 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 wallpaper because I think a lot 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.060
 and I 'm going to give it does not mean 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:02.540

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 front and left something for you here 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.050
 I wrote penny 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.759
 but if you're not going to go out in your house 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.840
 so he wrote pens appear one 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.390
 The candidate is because so my ink 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.030
 she can write that she had these 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.130
 things here just from little pen to you pass 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.520
 wet cloth and leave 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.010
 So I think this one from the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.570
 I do not remember the name of this extinct 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.530
 it's been a while 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.390
 on a fourth then I wrote more 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.560
 This will not come out writing an asset. 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.989
 I kill a lot 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:45.530
 I'm going back down now, I'm going to 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.530
 you 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.130
 the pictures 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.590
 I'm doing it in the car of the South. 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.830
 well I said this way we will not 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:24.090
 do so that way I think the cool 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:29.040
 tottenham while you I put by 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:34.260
 ex partners with a little here I'll put 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:46.320
 This will donate your heart to the series but I will 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:48.530
 put whoever left the ground stayed 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.270
 chaotic 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:04:00.240
 Okay, I'll put more here now. 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:01.650
 have switch put this I'm 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.270
 placing average argentinian random 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:12.020
 also seal any of this here from acre 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.020
 I think a lot 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:26.930
 does not fit well on the side of those who tried to 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:29.300
 new and now the last one is this 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.480
 in the pacino slide clip I assumed 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.290
 quite as much as the maximum I go 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:44.180
 put here the world's poverty rate 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:50.810
 11 years with a good serve is the mess 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:54.950
 She used to play good people here with 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.950
 us is that my wall is thus a 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.620
 big metallica bet on 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.919
 several posters here have time to 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.450
 putting items also means very good 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.180
 no edict 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.270
 but we are the first paper partner 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.580
 normal sofit type is all black and white 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:20.830
 all black and white will be fine 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.700
 Good people, I hope you liked it. 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.740
 enjoy tasty disclose listener der 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.450
 It's a cool cool tip too. 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.640
 I hope to make your room 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.700
 you can print many type images 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.710
 make the whole wall is cool too 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.560
 septic 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.450
 I played a few times I'm going to paint 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.460
 I'm going to take care of my room. 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.290
 so if it's estimated that the cut was already 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.000
 I was ready to have it then. 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.510
 my inspired but already puts the same 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.050
 that 's good, this is it, this is it 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:58.340
 I'll show the door later. 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.919
 there but this is another poorly explained video 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.810
 has several steps to serve on the channel 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.810
 So this is a kiss, bye.
