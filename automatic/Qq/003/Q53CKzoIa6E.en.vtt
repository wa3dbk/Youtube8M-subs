00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello everyone welcome again serve 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.639
 you blog today I bring you a tutorial very 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.610
 easy and fast it comes in three ways 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.919
 to put on a handkerchief I have chosen this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.169
 of celia candle that I like a lot for its 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:21.029
 dimensions and by their combination of 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.979
 colors that the print has since 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.349
 well allows a lot of play these three 

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.909
 forms of porn is the handkerchief we are going to 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.429
 serve both the beach as the 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.979
 pool as well as for the office 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.320
 I for example have chosen a look with 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:37.260
 with this blouse that is from enami this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 h &amp; m collar and as the handkerchief 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.850
 is the protagonist of this video so 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.030
 without more I leave you with the video I hope that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030
 I like you 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.830
 He doubled our Spanish or in half 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.449
 this will be the measure for the three 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.039
 examples 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.410
 for the first one I made a bow 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.050
 lateral that will give equally well whether 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.320
 is more carefree as I carry what 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.089
 more formal if you want it to work 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.909
 we take the handkerchief and put it on 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.390
 front to back and surround the bun 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.460
 covering the beginning of this we ended up with 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 a strong knot trying that on a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.950
 little of the handkerchief as there will be a lot 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.950
 best 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.490
 for the second example we put the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.829
 handkerchief on the nape of the neck and we 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.109
 ahead we cross it and carry the 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.459
 ends back to catch them by 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.459
 the lower part of the neck 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.260
 keep in mind that to do this 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.260
 you must tighten the scarf 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 and for the third and last example 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.110
 we return to take the handkerchief from the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.450
 facing towards the nape of the neck making a knot in 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.780
 she to subsequently perform a 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.780
 tie 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.739
 if you do not do it, it will be much better 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.710
 I hope you liked it and you cheer up 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.080

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.060
