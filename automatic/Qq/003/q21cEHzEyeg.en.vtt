it's a 2 6 6 8 door what that means is
the<00:01:08.369> first<00:01:08.670> two<00:01:08.910> numbers<00:01:09.179> 2<00:01:09.780> 6<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.530> 2<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the first two numbers 2 6 is 2 is the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.930 
the first two numbers 2 6 is 2 is the
width<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.990> 2<00:01:14.030> would<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> foot<00:01:16.039> size<00:01:17.039> 2<00:01:17.610> feet

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
width so 2 would be the foot size 2 feet

side and measure that okay want to be on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
side and measure that okay want to be on
this<00:02:12.780> side<00:02:13.079> as<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.950> pulling<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> door

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640

towards you and you're going to take

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.210 
towards you and you're going to take
measurement<00:02:16.870> because<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.320> edge<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.920> always

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
measurement because this edge is always

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.550 
measurement because this edge is always
the<00:02:18.340> high<00:02:18.550> edge<00:02:18.820> usually<00:02:19.420> generally<00:02:20.260> they

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the high edge usually generally they

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.180 
the high edge usually generally they
have<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.950> back<00:02:21.310> bevel<00:02:21.820> about<00:02:22.230> 3/16<00:02:23.230> 3/32

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
have this back bevel about 3/16 3/32

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190 
have this back bevel about 3/16 3/32
something<00:02:24.520> like<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.600> when<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.930> close

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
something like that so when you close

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.890 
something like that so when you close
the<00:02:26.440> door<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:27.370> edge<00:02:27.700> will<00:02:28.120> not<00:02:28.270> hit<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> edge

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the door that edge will not hit the edge

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.260 
the door that edge will not hit the edge
of<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.230> door<00:02:29.380> jamb<00:02:29.740> okay<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
of the door jamb okay so this is the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.140 
of the door jamb okay so this is the
high<00:02:31.480> edge<00:02:32.160> here<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.580> I'm<00:02:33.760> going<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.970> measure

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
high edge here so I'm going to measure

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.400 
high edge here so I'm going to measure
that<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.400> I've<00:02:36.400> got<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.970> don't<00:02:37.420> have<00:02:37.630> 30<00:02:37.930> inches
