 over the last few years they have 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.620
 proliferated everywhere a few places of 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.010
 recreation that monopolize the attraction of 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.529
 young people the clubs this phenomenon 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.630
 is inextricably linked to the disk 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 and is surrounded by a series of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 factors oriented towards consumerism 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 the young people of today immersed almost always 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.820
 in very complex social systems 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.980
 they need very expansion formulas 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 sophisticated to download all the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.579
 tension that daily accumulate one of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.579
 maybe this is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 not bad 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.909
 it could be said then that the disco is 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.799
 a recipient of that discharge of 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.259
 violence that exists at least in a way 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.940
 latent in quite a few young people the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.790
 discotheque 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.710
 to walk around everything that can not 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 contain because other pressures the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.880
 downloads with the music arrive the unit 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.430
 terrible level research 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 absolutely violence and even 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.800
 get to the fight as you arrive 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.800
 Many times 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.700
 some of them
