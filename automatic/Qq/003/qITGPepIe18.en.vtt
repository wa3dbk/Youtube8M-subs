00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:01:10.910 

that's<00:00:40.199> a<00:00:40.320> heaping<00:00:40.829> tablespoon<00:01:09.530> that's<00:01:10.530> fishy

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's a heaping tablespoon that's fishy

00:01:10.920 --> 00:02:06.850 
that's a heaping tablespoon that's fishy
look<00:01:11.039> like

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:03:00.650 

and<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.250> picking<00:02:08.640> off<00:02:59.090> this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.299> just

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and if it's not picking off this is just

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:53.210 
and if it's not picking off this is just
another<00:03:00.900> first<00:03:01.440> one

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.830 

and<00:03:54.220> if<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> gets<00:03:54.580> too<00:03:54.790> thick<00:03:55.060> like<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.300> you

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and if it gets too thick like this you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.640 
and if it gets too thick like this you
can<00:03:55.989> just<00:03:56.850> draw<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> little<00:03:58.180> more<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:59.500> your

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
can just draw a little more of your

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.670 
can just draw a little more of your
cream<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.070> there<00:04:01.590> yeah<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.170> my<00:04:05.320> make

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
expanding I hope yep it is see it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.539 
expanding I hope yep it is see it
expanding<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.799> is<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.100> correct<00:04:21.370> way<00:04:21.489> to

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
expanding that is the correct way to

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.659 
expanding that is the correct way to
make<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:22.919> we'll<00:04:23.919> do<00:04:24.100> these<00:04:24.250> for<00:04:24.460> another

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
make it we'll do these for another

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.030 
make it we'll do these for another
session<00:04:25.320> I'll<00:04:26.320> get<00:04:26.500> back<00:04:26.620> at<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.800> guys<00:04:27.030> peace
