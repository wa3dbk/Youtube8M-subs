00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.449
 the history of the have been written by the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.910
 men who have made work their 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 commitment to life and have believed in a 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 project that has already grown the vision of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.509
 who have been in charge of the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.420
 company 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.460
 his memories give an idea of ​​the great effort 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.530
 what it meant to make the la the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.589
 most important dairy company of mexico 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.839
 with an international memory presence 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.909
 it is conserved and they go back us to the moment in 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.470
 that the hands were the perfect machine 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.830
 to get milk 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.160
 more than 60 years ago that's how we order the 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.160
 cows 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.030
 he milks her hand or he is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.610
 they gave 20 cows to each computer so that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.890
 the burners twice a day 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.119
 very heavy computer work 20 cows 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 these little hands rolled huáscar 15 years 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.369
 reduce that light and 5 and we marry the fats 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.960
 cured judas those ordered to 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 fed 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.680
 It was my vocation but my life was even going 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 to school he had to milk the cows 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.510
 then I would come to my school smelling 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 down and the girl did not want a 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.009
 restaurant nearby serving the need 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.790
 caused the milk producers to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.600
 will group at that time there was the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.120
 incidence of marten fever than in the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.640
 comarca lagunera see article 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.550
 and the consequence according to what the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 doctors was for the consultations of what 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.650
 quarrel then the governor of the state 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.920
 called the ranchers 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.909
 and he told them you can not continue selling 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.259
 of chevron 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.259
 you have to celebrate it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.390
 the rancher responded almost to the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.300
 unison with what I know if we do not have 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.390
 just to keep the casualties 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.930
 fixed that I already bring a director of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.420
 glass to make them a loan and they 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.830
 organize because if you do not put the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.780
 work place put me and governments and with 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.690
 two and a half million pesos that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 get the Lord governor started 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.000
 the construction of the credit union 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.650
 first and then the plaza had that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.799
 great vision 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.049
 of forming the plant in 1950 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.420
 pasteurized pasteurized the lagoon that 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.010
 the local court continues to exist 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.470
 keep 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.700
 a year earlier they had founded the union of 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.409
 credit in 1949 and I say it was a 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.829
 vision and an ability to do 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.250
 things because they shaped us first by 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.459
 say it how to finance yourself and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.189
 then they made the plants and how they 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.800
 sold the milk in the 50s how it 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.440
 I commercialized 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.690
 they engaged in the jars of 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.060
 glass with cardboard lid and in a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 cart the villagers distribute it by the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.540
 turret streets that glass container 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.120
 because it was handled this or they will be expensive 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.880
 with ice bottle had to be 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.580
 I had to wash the 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.530
 glass can be the basic element for 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.319
 to pack milk 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.130
 but technology had already come 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.350
 of the carton then take 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.140
 the calculation of the things of the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.270
 then counselors and begin to 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.040
 make a reproach an approach to 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.840
 make that change a change that was then 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.660
 extraordinarily beneficial for the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.260
 company really for me that was the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.840
 start with with such a change 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.940
 radical as was leaving the video for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.150
 adopt the carton 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.740
 in an incessant flow of ideas 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.590
 consolidates a longing that seemed 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.850
 unattainable reach the city of 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.550
 mexico with milk lagoon all over the world 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.129
 I thought it was a cloth taken to that 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.159
 distance 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:46.040
 Milk adventure because it is an adventure 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:50.030
 go take that mexico and really 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:54.290
 had to move with pipes like 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.420
 it's now that they were thermal and that 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.130
 they could travel a minimum distance in 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.740
 thousand kilometers and return empty that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.610
 was a 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.080
 a challenge and it was a success first for the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.630
 product quality 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.020
 here he made a 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.440
 very intense campaign on quality 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.560
 thanks to that the product could be handled 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.420
 at great distances with a quality 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.120
 optimal I would say that the takeoff towards the 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.750
 city ​​of mexico was the detonator of 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.390
 this group the pride of being part of the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.460
 langue manifests itself in many ways and 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.830
 Shearing is a company with a large 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.000
 story that was written with work 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.430
 effort and dedication is the leader in the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.300
 country also finding in the 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.650
 foreign since those growths are 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.140
 sign that the company has 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.260
 potential to expand because see 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.750
 possibilities in other countries how can 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.790
 be your life and after a while for being a 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.129
 global company this one has lamented and 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.649
 there you have to 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.590
 try to grow as the 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.830
 weather 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.310
 today the legation a brand is not a 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.670
 name that is not identity the 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.470
 means the pond and for us it is 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.650
 the land that has allowed us to be 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.660
 land of hard work effort and the 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.970
 thriving spirit that accommodates all 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.790
 but history of a very big story 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.230
 making a school for the personal 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:40.370
 I believe that it is an example for many and 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.380
 It is a July belonging to the group 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.470
 belong to that we have thrown many 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.889
 you want supported of course by our 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.349
 counselor friends in turn 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.919
 and supported by the great human capital 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:58.560
 that we have the job that are all 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:01.500
 they were working on the rejones 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.860
 with the company 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.840
 we must fight for the same goal and 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.900
 always with an eye on being 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.900
 better every day to be teachers in our 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.020
 each person's work is what it plays 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.840
 remain constancy 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.199
 that I am a grateful son of a 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.199
 nothing
