00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.960
 Well, let's learn to make a 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.940
 cascade braid that as you can see is a 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.830
 braid from which the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.660
 milestones strands and the result it is 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.190
 quite original 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.080
 well then to make a braid in 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.689
 waterfall the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.939
 divide the head as in two sections 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.820
 because that we are going to use the hair of 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.400
 the top then let's catch 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.789
 since above and those below is 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.199
 loose of what up here we are going to 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.489
 start as if we can make a 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.840
 root braid alone with that part is worth 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.280
 then we take a first lock 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.770
 and we divide it into 3 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.370
 and we do it with a normal braid 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.610
 of lateral we passed to the center and the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.910
 lateral we go back to the center 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.000
 and now we start doing it at the root for 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:05.080
 that the one that touches pass we take a little bit 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.270
 of hair and together we pass it to the center 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.680
 and now we would play the day down good 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.840
 because in the one below we're going to do 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.320
 reverse with the one above we take hair and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.580
 with the one below we release the first 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.890
 tuft is going to be very very finite 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.750
 because it is already finite it is worth 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.300
 we divide in two the one that is further away 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.550
 of the braid result and the one that remains 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.110
 closer we put it 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.979
 we do the same again the above 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.979
 get hair 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.320
 and it goes towards the center 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.580
 and the one below is divided into two and the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 Closer lock to the braid is passed 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.930
 the center we do the same again 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.180
 we take hair 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.150
 and we passed it to the center 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.820
 and the strand that is below it 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.400
 we divide in two and the one that is closest 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 of the braid is the one that we pass to the center 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.530
 well then when we have finished the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.300
 we fasten it with a rubber band or a 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.300
 hairpin what you like most 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.250
 with a rubber band because it will be more subject 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.250
 obviously 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.420
 we put the gummie 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.520
 and as you can see the result is a braid 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.530
 quite original because they are coming out 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.010
 many milestones that is what is called in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.010
 waterfall
