00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
cutting separated and what you basically

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.260 
cutting separated and what you basically
do<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.670> electric<00:00:45.030> heating

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

element in there and you mix it in with
some<00:00:46.739> lava<00:00:47.010> rocks<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.719> throw

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
some lava rocks and then you can throw

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.130 
some lava rocks and then you can throw
some<00:00:50.120> some<00:00:51.120> wood<00:00:51.329> chips<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:51.960> some
