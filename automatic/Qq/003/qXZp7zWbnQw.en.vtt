00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.829
 created again has been reborn from its 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.390
 ashes fixes looks as little as 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.940
 the previous but now it has my height 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.559
 173 and my weight 70 good that is a bit 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.089
 less but you tend to kilos it's called 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.230
 rock selic because I liked it more than 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.570
 rock and consumer that you want me to 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.330
 Say and we're here and it's already gone

 buy and with comments in Spanish and 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.070
 this will be the match of the rookies and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.720
 I'm very excited even if it's good 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.929
 early in the morning, good guys, 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.380
 this is the match of the rookies against 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.509
 the rookies rookies against the rockies 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.560
 I go with the whites and good here 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.030
 represents what you have to do 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.160
 is to play you all your future to me not me 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.990
 name everything against everything but without 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.520
 look I do not know why the lilac art this is 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 the one that I defend good because that's a 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.509
 match in which we have to play the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.770
 against each other to prove what 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.430
 good we are and attention because 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.430
 we carry 5 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.990
 789 shot triple before 10 seconds 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.390
 has already gotten my first three points 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.050
 Well, that was how we did the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.300
 game in which we have to 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.860
 impress the crawlers so that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.990
 choose us to make better teams and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.000
 so then how much better is the team 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.590
 well the higher the draft is 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 more desire and all that good in the end we have 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.850
 made a summary of this match 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.670
 we are the elite and we play 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.930
 against the stars and good the truth is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.600
 that I changed the profile of the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.270
 player is no longer simply a passer 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.580
 notice that assistance but now it is 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.040
 triple shooter with which I have 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.800
 let's go an aim from the triple that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.170
 you shit and I have a little embarrassment to the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.480
 time to throw that you flip or here is not 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.880
 you are going to see no error because I have not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.530
 You have seen a stopper 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.060
 seen the dwarf come on let's go let's go 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.680
 come on, you go out to something 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.350
 spectacular do not miss it bad 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.990
 land 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.860
 I have taken away all the bad things that I have 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.830
 done attention attention now yes 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.970
 but put it in, but give it good, I promise 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.650
 that I will make a mess then I have removed 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.650
 all the bad things other 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.800
 I've only put the good ones but it has me 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.350
 like 20 triples without exaggerating there you have 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.580
 another bom so we're not going to have 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.140
 no shame and will start 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.030
 put in but let's go what is not written 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.740
 As you can see, it is very small to the pooch 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.620
 end is called canijo by tape and I 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.630
 called canijo and quiroga and all these and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 well in what position do you think I'm going to 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.960
 to finish the draft I'm going to make a good 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.880
 We are already in the third quarter 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.810
 I've barely done things there touched a bit 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.810
 look now 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.930
 timely and painting that is rare 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.160
 it does not look like in my corduroy 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.160
 aggressions and aggressions and the cinema 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.319
 you kill or you shit to the yo 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.150
 sorry that a liu that I just did with 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.710
 my good partner we are losing 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.440
 3 and it was little by little I got fucked 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.320
 voice let's go another do not leave me just one 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.700
 triple ya baby how many triples do you think 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.410
 I'm going to put how many points I'm going to 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.030
 do how far I'm going to go I want to 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.920
 know your opinions I know that never 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.290
 Trust me you are not bastards 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.580
 but today maybe you are wrong good 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.430
 I want to say nothing, I'm just going to say that 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.530
 the end is epic evidently as in 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.090
 all the videos of this channel and the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.330
 principles and everything is super epic 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.110
 here in the end we win forgiveness we tie with 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.050
 that assistance 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.570
 here we are gaining fingers and look at 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.240
 this moment that were 48 seconds I'm going to 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.190
 steal the pass is very important this 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.260
 moment because we win fingers he stole the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.110
 pass and what do I throw it out but 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.520
 because latinas from there rock do not 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.000
 interested I will end the game with 9 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.070
 points 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.420
 I was not interested, I do not think I can 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.310
 do more and I want them to choose me and 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.260
 I want to make everything very clear as 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.700
 I'm very good so I've stolen the ball 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.040
 and stretch I have thrown it and here goes another 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.210
 what can you do simply 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.699
 gara 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.310
 not obviously I will not sting me the 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.410
 He knew ahead and failed because rock 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.569
 because because I want to play prorogation 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.819
 the coach sees it and tells me to you 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.569
 bench left 20 seconds and 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:51.179
 we want to win and what happens 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.339
 now you will see it let's simulate there is 

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:55.740
 extension 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:56.819
 I came away with mine draw to 96 and we're going to 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.469
 make an extension but it's not a 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:04.309
 normal extension is an epic extension 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:04.309
 because you are going to see it from 9 we went to 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:11.509
 attention because we go there 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.009
 but hope that we are not that not 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.699
 we are moment that we are going we are 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.699
 spiro lee 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.319
 free throw we've already been there 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:35.410
 with the 17 points attention because it is 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:36.940
 an incredible minute and triple what is 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.540
 happening in a failed nor one I've 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.220
 put all the shots before the other 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.220
 what's going on 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.090
 And it is 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:56.020
 schubert looks at his and how good you are 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.599
 26 points has scored 17 points in the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.979
 extension that's why I wanted an extension 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.389
 I'm explaining here the kid that 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.300
 It makes you look pissed 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.770
 man looks how it hurts 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.710
 and here I keep talking just because I'm 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.330
 equally bad or worse 17 points in the 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.969

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.219
 strength than ever and is evidently the 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:22.090
