 freeze of memphis the rise of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 season 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.470
 the first and last of the moscone system 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 silver that we and chen are and therefore 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.660
 starting to see a bit like it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 presents this player with 74 90's 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 85 dribbling speed 80 shooting and 68 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 of passage 64 in the head also but those 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.040
 three features 90 85 80 on a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.030
 player reached are fantastic 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 fantastic indeed going to read a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.100
 bit of series is in game 81 of control 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.390
 ball 91 throws on lap 89 reading 92 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 impressions and ammunition 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.039
 at 35 the workshop 98 impotence shooting 94 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.629
 acceleration 90 reason shot 87 will act 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.050
 83 of physical strength a left wing 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.059
 boys so in short a player who 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 it soon becomes clear that it will be strong and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.489
 in fact in the field is not strong is more in 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.680
 change something devastating is 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 surely there is stronger silver than 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 have ever tried but miss have indeed 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 to talk about after flop 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.049
 the first top is speed speed 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 always with the combination together with dribbling 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 94 and acceleration in 90 cleans up a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.939
 click 81 control ball 89 the king 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.470
 1087 decide with four if the skins in 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.390
 even with this boy you can dribble 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.990
 in all color ways fed not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 take them 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 zig zag i'm not going to use le 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 four stars writes more than non arthritis 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 they take you and then he is one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.829
 of the funniest things that exist 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.979
 that is on food because it is so easy 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.909
 volÃ©e 85 also seems higher than that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 you make space easily, that is, I him 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.770
 I used to go to schools in Europe 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.320
 therefore faced gold teams however it was 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.189
 stronger than their normal ie as true 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.729
 he demonstrates 63 1 84 such thing 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.079
 however forward after the binomial 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.179
 dribbling the lures your physics 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.920
 because 80 of the physical forces for a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.960
 to the left to 100 which also fast 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.560
 something impressive indeed 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.390
 they came from the right and left of the gods 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.460
 in men also monsters who 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
 they wanted to move a shoulder not shoulder 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.210
 is however desisted because its 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.610
 statistic is more than good compared to 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.240
 that of normal jerseys therefore not 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.210
 will have no problem sticking back 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520
 and not to lose the ball and another top and the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.670
 shooting shot because no one two three a giro 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.790
 it's fantastic but above all 98 in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.010
 enhanced is a value from by or the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780
 90 that is not that of 34 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.050
 the absence of being a player 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.880
 however not with 99 passes music is maybe 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.220
 the most powerful I've ever seen 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 he made monstrous goals that you are 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.940
 seeing even here the power does not 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.220
 is that we do not give up could not 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.930
 think about getting there because of the shooting 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.210
 de paris di pei was too much was too much 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.070
 powerful and then also in a col 75 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.750
 use in one is never wrong 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.370
 perhaps also thanks to enhanced Rome 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.680
 this ancient was in version seemed 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.990
 even more then another top are 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.610
 big 75 big with 4 on the streets 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.440
 weak to me were good crosses 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.450
 for handicap ball that remains as you know 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.500
 all a monster even short passages 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.090
 they are excellent 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.210
 in fact these few snapshots were enough 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.920
 really the 12 c was the only small ones though 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.230
 you have this as it was me sometimes 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.780
 I did many of the others and with that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.900
 62 2000 drove out enough though 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.050
 guys here you want even among those 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.940
 so just this player raises 26 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.270
 small both me and not found others 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.910
 that is, he is a fantastic player then 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.450
 I can use the perfect lincoln williams 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.270
 in four letters between 24 to use it with 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.860
 also a liga bbva in a series a in 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.640
 a league sees so if you have i 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.340
 money one of his players 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.300
 buy it because it is very very much 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.760
 very strong 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.830
 this is a test I forgot too much 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.990
 also set pieces because 92 countries do not 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.640
 it's ammunition accuracy is 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.350
 fantastic even 70 of those hours is 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.350
 good then of her on bike
