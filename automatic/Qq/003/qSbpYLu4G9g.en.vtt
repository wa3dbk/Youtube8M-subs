00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:24.120
 follow your heart: p 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.597
 no matter how long I say stop, 

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:37.345
 Even though your friends try to stop, 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.371
 it's not possible, I can't 

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.641
 I'il wait for you, even if it's a day 

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:51.977
 somehow I remember you, and I can't tell you 

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:55.803
 I write the words every day. 

00:00:55.804 --> 00:01:00.109
 I still love you so much 

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:03.603
 I ... I can't believe we broke up. I... 

00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:10.962
 I ... I can't leave that place you left me. 

00:01:10.997 --> 00:01:14.710
 You're the one and the only love in my life 

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:19.767
 I can't wipe you off, oh. 

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:25.470
 As soon as you come back to me, I can't leave. I... 

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.191
 I believed everything I was told 

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:31.910
 As the time passes, the wounds will heal 

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:35.479
 Even if it hurts now. 

00:01:35.514 --> 00:01:39.048
 I'll forget you, maybe a day like this 

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:42.897
 But why is my heart still pitying? 

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:46.653
 Why, why am I like that? 

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:50.240
 Even if you're not my girlfriend anymore. 

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:53.919
 And today, I will sing for you again. 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.235
 I still love you so much 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.782
 I ... I can't believe we broke up. I... 

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:08.899
 I ... I can't leave that place you left me. 

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:13.019
 You're the one and the only love in my life 

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:17.638
 I can't wipe you off, oh. 

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:23.647
 I can't leave until you get back to me. I... 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.350
 (it's show time) 

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:35.077
 (let it rain!) 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.120
 I still love you so much 

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.480
 I ... I can't believe we broke up. I... 

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:52.847
 I ... I can't leave that place you left me. 

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:56.972
 You're the one and the only love in my life 

00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:01.358
 I can't wipe you down, oh you 

00:03:01.393 --> 00:03:07.592
 I can't leave until you get back to me. I... 

00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:11.254
 I still love you so much 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.754
 I ... I can't believe we broke up. I... 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:21.765
 I ... I can't leave that place you left me. 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.688
 You're the one and the only love in my life 

00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:30.626
 I can't wipe you down, oh you 

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:36.882
 I can't leave until you get back to me. I... 

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:55.718
 (breathe ... breathe ... breathe ...) 

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:23.112
 I still love you so much 

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:31.516
 I can't wipe you off 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.671
 I still love you so much 

00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:40.752
 I ... I can't leave that place you left me.
