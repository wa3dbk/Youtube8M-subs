what's<00:00:01.469> going<00:00:01.680> on<00:00:01.740> everybody<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:02.429> name<00:00:02.610> is

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
what's going on everybody my name is

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.260 
what's going on everybody my name is
Dave<00:00:03.500> first<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.770> just<00:00:04.859> want<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.370> apologize<00:00:05.940> if

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
Dave first I just want to apologize if

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
Dave first I just want to apologize if
I'm<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> little<00:00:06.720> bit<00:00:06.839> awkward<00:00:07.230> talking<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I'm a little bit awkward talking to a

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.440 
I'm a little bit awkward talking to a
camera<00:00:09.019> don't<00:00:10.019> do<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> too<00:00:10.650> often<00:00:11.269> this<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
camera don't do it too often this is

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
camera don't do it too often this is
going<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.870> my<00:00:13.110> first<00:00:13.440> tutorial<00:00:13.590> series<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
going to be my first tutorial series I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
going to be my first tutorial series I
hope<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.089> like<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.839> bear<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.350> me<00:00:16.529> at

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
hope you like it just bear with me at

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.200 
hope you like it just bear with me at
some<00:00:17.039> points<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:18.320> like<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> talk<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
some points I like to talk a lot and I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.980 
some points I like to talk a lot and I
take<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> while<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.439> hit<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.920> points<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.460> guess

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
take a while to hit my points I guess

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.720 
take a while to hit my points I guess
I'm<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.140> try<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.529> hard<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.859> keep<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
I'm gonna try really hard to keep it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.080 
I'm gonna try really hard to keep it
click<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.210> talk<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:28.769> possible

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
click and talk as little as possible

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
click and talk as little as possible
Yeah<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.550> first<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.570> talk<00:00:33.930> about

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
Yeah right so first I'm gonna talk about

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
Yeah right so first I'm gonna talk about
a<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.040> talk<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.579> bit

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
a little bit what and talk a little bit

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
a little bit what and talk a little bit
about<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> concept

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
about what we're gonna do the concept

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
about what we're gonna do the concept
and<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> theory<00:00:37.860> behind<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.309> 3d<00:00:38.610> spinning

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and the theory behind some 3d spinning

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.830 
and the theory behind some 3d spinning
and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:40.110> we'll<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.570> first

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and then we'll get right to it the first

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
and then we'll get right to it the first
thing<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:45.090> flat<00:00:45.329> plains<00:00:45.660> which

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
thing is you have your flat plains which

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
thing is you have your flat plains which
are<00:00:46.379> probably<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:47.070> familiar<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.110> found

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
are probably quite familiar with I found

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.840 
are probably quite familiar with I found
that<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> spinners<00:00:50.610> first

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that you know when the spinners first

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.689 
that you know when the spinners first
start<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> spin<00:00:53.039> without

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
start up they will kind of spin without

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
start up they will kind of spin without
much<00:00:53.910> concept<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.600> planes<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.320> their<00:00:55.469> plane

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
much concept of planes and their plane

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
much concept of planes and their plane
bending<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.910> whole<00:00:57.059> time<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.570> really

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
bending the whole time that I'm really

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
bending the whole time that I'm really
realizing<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.250> um<00:00:59.399> we're<00:01:00.120> covering

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
realizing it but um we're covering

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.330 
realizing it but um we're covering
planes<00:01:00.899> shifting<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
planes shifting for now and I'm going to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.910 
planes shifting for now and I'm going to
explain<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> difference<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.629> bit

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
explain the difference in a little bit

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520 
explain the difference in a little bit
but<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.510> spinners<00:01:06.510> start<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.140> techy

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but as spinners start to get more techy

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.510 
but as spinners start to get more techy
they<00:01:08.900> start<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.380> confined<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> wall<00:01:11.250> plane

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
they start to get confined to wall plane

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
they start to get confined to wall plane
because<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> today's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
because that is where a lot of today's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
because that is where a lot of today's
technical<00:01:14.670> patterns<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.390> focused<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
technical patterns are focused on a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.840 
technical patterns are focused on a
single<00:01:16.979> plane<00:01:17.189> spinning<00:01:19.280> yeah<00:01:20.280> personally

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
single plane spinning yeah personally

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
single plane spinning yeah personally
it's<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> confining<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> whole

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's kind of confining there's a whole

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
it's kind of confining there's a whole
lot<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.700> flat<00:01:24.030> plane

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
lot that you can do in flat plane

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.350 
lot that you can do in flat plane
spinning<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.430> confining<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
spinning but it is a bit confining and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
spinning but it is a bit confining and
the<00:01:27.659> overall<00:01:28.080> goal<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.770> us<00:01:29.960> object

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the overall goal for us object

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
the overall goal for us object
manipulators<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.920> complete<00:01:32.520> freedom<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
manipulators is complete freedom of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
manipulators is complete freedom of
movement<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.009> freedom<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
movement right so if you want freedom of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.390 
movement right so if you want freedom of
movement<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> need<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.400> include

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
movement you kind of need to include

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
movement you kind of need to include
more<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.689> plane<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
more than just one plane because you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
more than just one plane because you
have<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.610> space<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> all

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
have all of this space out here and all

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.960 
have all of this space out here and all
of<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.590> space<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.100> front<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
of this space in front that you could be

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.440 
of this space in front that you could be
exploring<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.340> ultimate<00:01:47.430> goal<00:01:47.729> freedom

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
exploring so the ultimate goal freedom

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.410 
exploring so the ultimate goal freedom
of<00:01:48.570> movement<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.100> teach<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> one

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
of movement and I'm gonna teach you one

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.260 
of movement and I'm gonna teach you one
other<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.259> getting<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.820> are

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
other way of getting there there are

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
other way of getting there there are
there's<00:01:55.170> many<00:01:55.380> ways<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.310> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
there's many ways to get there you know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.510 
there's many ways to get there you know
be<00:01:56.759> completely<00:01:57.240> honest<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.040> not<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
be completely honest and not all of it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.870

see you can see what I mean here is very

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.130 
see you can see what I mean here is very
interesting<00:03:15.220> pattern<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.850> look<00:03:16.000> at<00:03:16.239> but<00:03:16.989> when

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
interesting pattern to look at but when

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.620 
interesting pattern to look at but when
traced<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.860> with<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.280> pen<00:03:18.850> or<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> pencil<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.600> a

piece of paper isn't particularly

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.560 
piece of paper isn't particularly
amazing<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.269> concept<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:27.570> we're

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
amazing but it's the concept that we're

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.240 
amazing but it's the concept that we're
spinning<00:03:29.019> in<00:03:29.140> single<00:03:29.560> planes<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.160> we're

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.070 
spinning in single planes and we're
making<00:03:30.580> these<00:03:30.700> patterns<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.480> they're<00:03:31.900> very

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
making these patterns and they're very

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.650 
making these patterns and they're very
cool<00:03:32.260> regardless<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.120> method<00:03:34.299> of<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
cool regardless of the method of the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.100 
cool regardless of the method of the
pattern<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:36.160> who's<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.940> say<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:37.630> we<00:03:37.780> can't

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
pattern but who's to say that we can't

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.990 
pattern but who's to say that we can't
make<00:03:38.320> our<00:03:38.500> Paris<00:03:38.830> three-dimensional<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.760> is

to<00:06:25.569> transition<00:06:26.530> between<00:06:26.680> cubes<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:28.020> you<00:06:29.020> know

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
to transition between cubes and you know

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.480 
to transition between cubes and you know
to<00:06:29.169> really<00:06:29.469> just<00:06:29.710> kind<00:06:29.889> of<00:06:29.919> move<00:06:30.159> between

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
to really just kind of move between

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.560 
to really just kind of move between
cubes<00:06:31.210> in<00:06:31.630> a<00:06:31.839> larger<00:06:32.440> grid<00:06:32.820> while<00:06:33.820> utilizing

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
cubes in a larger grid while utilizing

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.590 
cubes in a larger grid while utilizing
the<00:06:35.199> play

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
the play

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.210 
the play
within<00:06:36.050> the<00:06:36.230> cube<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:36.650> you're<00:06:36.860> currently

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
within the cube that you're currently

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.850 
within the cube that you're currently
standing<00:06:37.340> in<00:06:38.020> so<00:06:39.020> I<00:06:39.050> really<00:06:39.500> like<00:06:39.680> that

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
standing in so I really like that

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.400 
standing in so I really like that
concept<00:06:40.510> just<00:06:41.710> for<00:06:42.710> for<00:06:43.160> ease<00:06:43.370> I<00:06:43.900> added<00:06:44.900> in<00:06:45.050> the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
concept just for for ease I added in the

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.780 
concept just for for ease I added in the
red<00:06:45.830> dots<00:06:46.130> here<00:06:46.360> to<00:06:47.360> show<00:06:48.040> the<00:06:49.040> stall<00:06:49.280> points

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
red dots here to show the stall points

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.750 
red dots here to show the stall points
that<00:06:50.000> the<00:06:50.120> XYZ<00:06:50.390> axis<00:06:51.110> would<00:06:51.290> show<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:51.800> I<00:06:52.430> even

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
that the XYZ axis would show and I even

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.590 
that the XYZ axis would show and I even
added<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.210> XYZ<00:06:53.810> on<00:06:54.230> there<00:06:54.530> so<00:06:55.270> just<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.420> better

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
added the XYZ on there so just to better

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.840 
added the XYZ on there so just to better
represent<00:06:56.900> the<00:06:57.740> relationship<00:06:58.340> between<00:06:58.520> the

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
represent the relationship between the

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.140 
represent the relationship between the
two<00:06:59.800> so<00:07:00.800> now<00:07:01.250> that<00:07:01.310> I<00:07:01.490> covered<00:07:01.850> a<00:07:01.910> little<00:07:02.000> bit

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
two so now that I covered a little bit

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.230 
two so now that I covered a little bit
of<00:07:02.330> theory<00:07:02.660> and<00:07:03.080> used<00:07:03.350> some<00:07:03.500> visuals<00:07:03.950> to<00:07:04.640> help

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
of theory and used some visuals to help

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.170 
of theory and used some visuals to help
with<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.840> conceptualizing<00:07:06.850> we're<00:07:07.850> gonna<00:07:07.970> get

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
with the conceptualizing we're gonna get

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.570 
with the conceptualizing we're gonna get
out<00:07:08.270> of<00:07:08.390> the<00:07:08.480> tutorial<00:07:08.990> that<00:07:09.230> I<00:07:09.260> filmed<00:07:10.010> prior

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
out of the tutorial that I filmed prior

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.420 
out of the tutorial that I filmed prior

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
I can do you I want to show you this

I can do you I want to show you this
this<00:07:18.410> really<00:07:18.860> cool<00:07:19.190> lighter<00:07:19.520> that<00:07:19.760> I<00:07:19.820> found

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
this really cool lighter that I found

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.750 
this really cool lighter that I found
you<00:07:20.210> see<00:07:20.360> that<00:07:20.950> what<00:07:21.950> does<00:07:22.070> that<00:07:22.100> look<00:07:22.370> like<00:07:22.400> to

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
you see that what does that look like to

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.200 
you see that what does that look like to
you<00:07:22.790> does<00:07:23.570> that<00:07:23.600> not<00:07:24.110> look<00:07:24.440> like<00:07:25.100> poi<00:07:25.490> geometry

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
you does that not look like poi geometry

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.720 
you does that not look like poi geometry
to<00:07:26.390> you<00:07:26.830> yeah<00:07:27.830> I<00:07:28.160> like<00:07:28.610> it<00:07:28.790> you<00:07:29.390> don't<00:07:29.540> have<00:07:29.570> to
