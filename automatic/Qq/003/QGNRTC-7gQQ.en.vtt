 Alexey and present to you today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.799
 new video and game euro truck 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.099
 simulator 2 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.280
 This is another video from the review cycle . 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.379
 mods in which I review mods for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 this game that is telling them 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.490
 whether they should be put at all what they are 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 have bugs and other stuff other stuff 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.949
 Today I got a truck review 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 american truck of life 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 freightliner fld 120 it is a little bit 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 different from l to 120 classic that is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 almost completely yes you can say 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.309
 different well, if so take a closer look 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 in more detail then basically different 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.410
 you headlights that is here a man 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 more or less rounded that is such 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.879
 more or less modern version of them 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.219
 let's say this mod is bought 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.280
 trucks in auto show evolve spelled 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.350
 On the individual in the third slot has a small 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.820
 such a bug I do not know what is the reason 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 there is why the steering column viper 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.539
 then we have here that is when we will 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 ride in the game we naturally do not 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.159
 everything will be fine that is it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 just for some reason we have in the showroom 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 such a bug let's go through the cabins 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.119
 that is, the cockpit we are standard chassis too 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 four engine options 2 boxes 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.909
 we shop here 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.980
 120 classic that is not in principle 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.710
 identical salons that is 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.230
 on a real truck when salon 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 apparently pulled out of 3 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.870
 truckers as in principle more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.750
 I didn't see it somewhere 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.700
 Salon model data 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.890
 This she was involved before but me 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.950
 still it seems that from presented 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.940
 typesetters then the whole thing was torn out 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.070
 also glued to us 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.680
 the so -called festoon with with countries with 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.570
 country flags and 2 pennants animated 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.400
 who are tied to my pedic 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.930
 gas and brake that is when we start 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.050
 accelerate and slow down they have 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.640
 standard colors are moving with us 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.130
 all five pieces are represented i.e. 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.110
 let's choose gray more or less so 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.480
 looks fine let's not go 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.830
 to tuning that is which nickname we have 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.380
 present on this tractor 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.410
 we have our wheels, that is, they are already 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.930
 spelled out to this truck spelled not 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.520
 as a standard, they are not replaced by others 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.770
 loads both on the same or not but in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.010
 principle did not notice anything when riding 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.870
 before video before recording principle everything 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.520
 trucks with standard wheels then 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.250
 there is like this most likely just already 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.570
 spelled under this mod as the front so 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 and take out of the wheel 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:39.220
 actually let 's take a look 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.480
 what we have ahead 1 we tuning bumper 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.730
 that is, you need to choose completely 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 plastic version with chrome insert 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.400
 or purely chrome already, that is, choose 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 as you like as you like, let's 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.100
 choose plastic a little higher here 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.200
 replacement 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.960
 fuel tanks i.e. chrome 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.630
 classic matte or normal 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.980
 wait and put the chrome do honestly 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.880
 chrome truck 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.610
 a little higher we have quite interesting 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.500
 thing that is, you can put 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.760
 plug on the glass sleeping bag that is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 which is located on the left and on the right 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 parties like go 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.670
 all that matters is changing here like this 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.850
 let's put also chrome with glass 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.430
 a little higher we are tuning exhaust 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.530
 pipes also they have us chrome 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.420
 chrome mats and frosted or just 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 already clean 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.860
 oy mat please apologize let's 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.090
 put the chrome a little higher we go 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.310
 coloring spoiler that is for the cockpit 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.650
 which here now let's put 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.780
 the block is more or less somehow completely going to be 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.490
 look a little higher we are already going by ourselves 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.640
 the property of the pilaf would need to be put 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.800
 remove as you like and on this in 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.420
 In principle, all our mirrors are standard 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.760
 that is, add nothing new 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.690
 no other parts for installation i'm not 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:10.930
 I found that we let us buy this 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:15.180
 I will drive a truck here so we drive 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.180
 for some reason not planted let's sit down 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.870
 try to look at it in the game then 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.820
 there is a leg like that all the cases we got under 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.070
 daughter it does not hurt us 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 let's look around the cabin that is 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.900
 the only thing that is certainly missing is 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.140
 gps navigator and just when 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.680
 it rains as you see drops on everything 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.930
 100 to fall from which fill one 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.070
 engine why wipers and how are you 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.090
 see collections that's all 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.949
 it is perfectly erased there is no such thing 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.120
 wipers she just like object dangles 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.280
 back and forth , they took the daughter with glass 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.690
 the instrument lighting is performed as 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.420
 we turn on the color mode immediately 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.410
 turns on 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.410
 indicator lights 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.840
 correctly 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.080
 like the range 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.080
 feels 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.020
 rina i am an alarm 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.260
 lower 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.620
 own sounds 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.690
 Tomato happy machine 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.690
 and also have his stock he 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.220
 just like the train okay let's take 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.700
 any cargo just take aim 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.870
 Let's see how the coupling works exactly. 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.680
 we already have some 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.680
 managed to pick up 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.960
 someone we gored there 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.960
 let's go 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.550
 light or 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.460
 I would like to say that 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.190
 most likely this mod will only 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.230
 sales that is 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.020
 sanyo 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.400
 what page to get about how it 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.820
 get I'll leave a link to 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.220
 the man who practiced the caiman people 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.860
 converted the game and leave the link in 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.750
 description of that 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.689
 system ask how is satan 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.449
 i get data here 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.710
 you need to decide whether you will be 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.860
 buy or not 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.630
 asked to remove the review show and 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.020
 tell how it is 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.020
 possesses 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.770
 how does it work 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.250
 recipe 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:20.409
 so it did look in the workshop hitch 

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:27.199
 cling naturally not only 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:28.699
 american trailer this all wings you 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:34.339
 just as calmly we can attach 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:36.649
 and this is probably all that I am 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:39.709
 I wanted to talk about this mode, that is 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:41.569
 once again I repeat all the links to 

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:43.039
 contacts with the author like this could 

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.899
 get hold i put in the description 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.079
 check the description write him lichku 

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:51.409
 ask very much how to take this whole thing 

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:53.269
