00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
okay now we want to start stretching it
get<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:44.970> knuckles<00:01:45.329> under<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
get your knuckles under it you have to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
get your knuckles under it you have to
work<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.710> fast<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.280> gravity<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
work really fast because gravity is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.490 
work really fast because gravity is
working<00:01:48.119> against<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> hold<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.170> into

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
working against you if you hold up into

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.190 
working against you if you hold up into
in<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:50.070> spot<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:50.640> long<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in one spot for too long it's going to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
in one spot for too long it's going to
stretch<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.100> holy<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
stretch out and get holy and if you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
stretch out and get holy and if you
really<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.630> fancy<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> throw

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
really want to get fancy you can throw

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.039 
really want to get fancy you can throw
it<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> air<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.520> spin<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.869> don't

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it up in the air and spin it just don't

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.399 
it up in the air and spin it just don't
rip<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
rip it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.039 
rip it
now<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.180> oil<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.930> we

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
now you don't have to use oil because we

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.100 
now you don't have to use oil because we
use<00:02:01.170> flour<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> add<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> little

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
use flour but I you like to add a little

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.600 
use flour but I you like to add a little
bit<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> oil<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> gives<00:02:05.009> me<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> crispy

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
bit of oil because it gives me a crispy

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.520 
bit of oil because it gives me a crispy
crust<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:06.810> about<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> tablespoon

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
crust so I'm at about a tablespoon

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
crust so I'm at about a tablespoon
spread<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> around<00:02:08.369> we've<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.479> nice
