00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
eat right off the get-go I got to eat a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.740

lot<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.160> different<00:00:17.490> types<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.850> food<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.660> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
lot of different types of food and I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.910 
lot of different types of food and I
think<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> best<00:00:20.900> Hungarian<00:00:21.900> food<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.350> ever<00:00:22.590> had

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
think the best Hungarian food I ever had

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.429 
think the best Hungarian food I ever had
was<00:00:23.340> fruit<00:00:23.640> soup<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> fruit

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
was fruit soup and you think a fruit

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
was fruit soup and you think a fruit
soup<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.099> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.369> fruit<00:00:26.939> soup

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
soup and it's kind of like fruit soup

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
soup and it's kind of like fruit soup
that<00:00:27.630> doesn't<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:27.990> work<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that doesn't really work right and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
that doesn't really work right and
that's<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> exact<00:00:30.359> same<00:00:30.390> thing

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that's what that's the exact same thing

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.209 
that's what that's the exact same thing
I<00:00:30.840> thought<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.260> fruit<00:00:31.529> soup<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.949> doesn't

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
I thought two fruit soup that doesn't

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.620 
I thought two fruit soup that doesn't
really<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.579> together<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.120> not<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.360> peanut
