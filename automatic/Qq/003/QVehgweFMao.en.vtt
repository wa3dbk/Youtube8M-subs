sniper rifles in general and that was
the<00:00:23.130> fact<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.850> final<00:00:24.240> round<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.539> no<00:00:24.660> longer

shot in PvP other than that they left
them<00:00:29.099> alone<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.340> we'll<00:00:29.760> snipers<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
them alone because we'll snipers do the

sniper things so how is this changing I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.069 
sniper things so how is this changing I
honestly<00:00:34.500> feel<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:36.090> now

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
honestly feel and this is just me now

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.440 
honestly feel and this is just me now
this<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.500> another<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:38.430> bungee<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this was another one of those bungee you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.139 
this was another one of those bungee you
shouldn't<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.780> done<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.050> things<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
shouldn't have done that things and

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
shouldn't have done that things and
honestly<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.649> understand<00:00:43.649> why<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.100> were

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
honestly I understand why they were

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
honestly I understand why they were
wanting<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> nerf<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> ice<00:00:45.120> breaker<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
wanting to nerf the ice breaker but I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750 
wanting to nerf the ice breaker but I
think<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> way<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:47.010> went<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.520> was

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
think the way they went about it was

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
think the way they went about it was
wrong<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> completely<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.530> silly<00:00:49.920> because

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
wrong and completely like silly because

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
wrong and completely like silly because
it<00:00:50.640> makes<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:50.879> sense<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> me<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.480> anyway<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
it makes no sense to me but anyway so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
it makes no sense to me but anyway so
let's<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.410> break<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:52.820> what<00:00:53.820> happened

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
let's just break it down what happened

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.209 
let's just break it down what happened
to<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> ice<00:00:54.480> breaker<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> ice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
minute everybody knows and they have the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.249 
minute everybody knows and they have the
theory<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> why<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.110> actually

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
theory of why this one was actually

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
theory of why this one was actually
targeted<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.159> earth<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.060> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
targeted for an earth and this is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
targeted for an earth and this is
because<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.750> black<00:01:24.960> hammer<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.770> know

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because the black hammer it you know

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
because the black hammer it you know
there<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> destiny<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> time

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there was a destiny there was a time

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
there was a destiny there was a time
before<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.619> black<00:01:28.890> hammer<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.430> everybody

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
before the black hammer when everybody

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
before the black hammer when everybody
did<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> ice<00:01:30.509> breaker<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.409> were<00:01:31.619> ways<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
did the ice breaker there were ways that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.859 
did the ice breaker there were ways that
you<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> play<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> catch<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you would have to play but the catch of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
you would have to play but the catch of
the<00:01:33.900> matter<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> ice<00:01:35.130> breaker<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.700> not

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the matter is is ice breaker was not

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.999 
the matter is is ice breaker was not

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that functional until dark below even

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
that functional until dark below even
came<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> mean<00:01:40.350> by

that is some people started using it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.580 
that is some people started using it
during<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> lamp<00:01:42.780> phase<00:01:43.079> where<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.470> would

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
during the lamp phase where they would

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
during the lamp phase where they would
shoot<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.979> Thrall<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> bunch<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.299> them

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
shoot a Thrall and then a bunch of them

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
shoot a Thrall and then a bunch of them
would<00:01:45.570> pop<00:01:45.780> open<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> confetti<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.130> was

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
would pop open like confetti that was

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
would pop open like confetti that was
great<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.820> awesome<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.869> about

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
great that was awesome but that's about

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.210 
great that was awesome but that's about
the<00:01:49.110> only<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.979> gun<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the only time that this gun is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
the only time that this gun is
functional<00:01:50.759> outside<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> boss<00:01:51.570> fight<00:01:51.600> many

times people get to certain secret areas

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
times people get to certain secret areas
of<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> map<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> thing

of a map or they do some kind of thing
were<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.479> example<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
were they pretty much for example the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
were they pretty much for example the
folk<00:01:58.170> off<00:01:58.409> kill<00:01:58.799> they<00:01:59.610> worry<00:01:59.820> about<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.119> they

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
folk off kill they worry about it they

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
folk off kill they worry about it they
just<00:02:00.540> sit<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.020> room<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.469> just

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
just sit back in that room and they just

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
just sit back in that room and they just
let<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.920> regenerate<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.270> they

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
let this regenerate so what I think they

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
let this regenerate so what I think they
were<00:02:03.420> trying<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.899> target<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.469> nerf<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
were trying the target in this nerf is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.499 
were trying the target in this nerf is
the<00:02:04.979> fact<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> black<00:02:05.610> hammer<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.270> being

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the fact that the black hammer was being

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.330 
the fact that the black hammer was being
nerfed<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.049> well<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> they<00:02:07.770> didn't<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.220> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
nerfed as well and they didn't want this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
nerfed as well and they didn't want this
to<00:02:08.399> fall<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> area<00:02:09.300> fill<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.810> void

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to fall into that area fill that void

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
to fall into that area fill that void
and<00:02:10.349> make<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.979> gun<00:02:11.190> become<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> only<00:02:11.940> gun

the right nerf for this gun to be honest

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.370 
the right nerf for this gun to be honest
and<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.920> worst<00:03:26.100> part<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.780> game<00:03:27.989> where

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
and the worst part is in a game where

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.680

the ice breaker was finally somewhat

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.000 
ridiculous i say the average lifespan
for<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> person<00:04:21.480> in<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:22.049> game<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.590> 20<00:04:22.919> or

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
for a person in this game is like 20 or

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.820 
for a person in this game is like 20 or
30<00:04:23.250> seconds<00:04:23.820> i'd<00:04:24.210> say<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.260> passive

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
30 seconds i'd say for the passive

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.290 
30 seconds i'd say for the passive
players<00:04:26.130> alone<00:04:26.610> so

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
players alone so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.480 
players alone so
the<00:04:27.569> way<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.720> look<00:04:28.139> at<00:04:28.319> it<00:04:28.349> is<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.889> impossible

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the way I look at it is it's impossible

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.860 
the way I look at it is it's impossible
to<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.699> full<00:04:29.909> mag<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.419> Icebreaker

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
to get a full mag with the Icebreaker

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.110 
to get a full mag with the Icebreaker
anymore<00:04:31.379> because<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.099> delay<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.000> think

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
anymore because of this delay so I think

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.809 
anymore because of this delay so I think
this<00:04:33.479> is<00:04:33.599> hurting<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.319> Icebreaker<00:04:35.039> in<00:04:35.250> PvP

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
this is hurting the Icebreaker in PvP

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.480 
this is hurting the Icebreaker in PvP
more<00:04:36.479> than<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.139> PvE<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.949> that's

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
more than it is in PvE and that's

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.159 
more than it is in PvE and that's
dangerous<00:04:38.729> seeing<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.360> how<00:04:39.479> it<00:04:39.629> actually<00:04:39.810> had

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
dangerous seeing is how it actually had

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.320 
dangerous seeing is how it actually had
functioned<00:04:40.530> for<00:04:40.770> PvP<00:04:41.220> for<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> first<00:04:41.819> time<00:04:42.060> in

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
functioned for PvP for the first time in

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.809 
functioned for PvP for the first time in
a<00:04:42.419> long<00:04:42.449> time<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> good<00:04:43.830> job<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.430> bungee

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
a long time so a good job to you bungee

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.059 
a long time so a good job to you bungee
you've<00:04:45.180> officially<00:04:45.509> made<00:04:45.960> this<00:04:46.139> gun<00:04:46.409> probably

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
you've officially made this gun probably

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.950 
you've officially made this gun probably
useless<00:04:47.370> for<00:04:47.669> PvP<00:04:48.180> because<00:04:48.509> waiting<00:04:48.810> eight

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
useless for PvP because waiting eight

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.200 
useless for PvP because waiting eight
seconds<00:04:49.440> for<00:04:49.560> only<00:04:49.710> one<00:04:50.009> bullet<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.580> having

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
seconds for only one bullet and having

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.309 
seconds for only one bullet and having
to<00:04:51.270> wait<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.419> whole<00:04:51.599> nother<00:04:51.659> eight<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.289> a

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
to wait a whole nother eight for a

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.439 
to wait a whole nother eight for a
follow-up<00:04:52.680> shot<00:04:53.069> that's<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.789> too<00:04:54.000> much<00:04:54.030> this

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
follow-up shot that's just too much this

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.089 
follow-up shot that's just too much this
thing<00:04:54.599> is<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:54.720> not<00:04:55.080> going<00:04:55.319> to<00:04:55.470> be<00:04:55.590> functional

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
thing is just not going to be functional

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.189 
thing is just not going to be functional
in<00:04:56.129> PvP<00:04:56.580> anymore<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.360> you've<00:04:57.509> eliminated<00:04:57.720> it

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
in PvP anymore so you've eliminated it

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.959 
in PvP anymore so you've eliminated it
there<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.099> thing<00:04:59.310> will<00:04:59.460> still<00:04:59.669> be<00:04:59.789> used

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
there so this thing will still be used

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.580 
there so this thing will still be used
in<00:05:00.150> boss<00:05:00.330> fights<00:05:00.629> the<00:05:00.780> joke's<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.379> guys

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590

those that are patient enough to wait

those that are patient enough to wait
five<00:05:03.509> minutes<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.900> kill<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> strike<00:05:04.409> will<00:05:04.860> be

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
five minutes to kill a strike will be

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.469 
five minutes to kill a strike will be

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
to attack I think will be an extremely

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.990
