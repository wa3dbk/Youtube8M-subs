00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 
it's that the kind of idea that if you

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:54.110 
it's that the kind of idea that if you
know<00:07:51.690> what<00:07:51.960> what<00:07:52.260> it<00:07:52.560> is<00:07:52.860> the<00:07:53.220> TV<00:07:53.550> is<00:07:53.580> going<00:07:53.940> to
