well I doubt whether I can do that I'm
sure<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.300> somebody<00:00:12.710> who's<00:00:13.710> into<00:00:14.070> doing

micro<00:00:15.120> miniature<00:00:15.690> things<00:00:15.960> has<00:00:16.199> made<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> really

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
micro miniature things has made a really

micro miniature things has made a really
small<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.840> but<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> thought<00:00:19.109> I'd<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.410> if<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
small one but I thought I'd see if I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.260 
small one but I thought I'd see if I
could<00:00:19.590> make<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.460> smaller<00:00:20.699> than<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
could make one that's smaller than I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.189 
could make one that's smaller than I
normally<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:22.580> not<00:00:23.580> using<00:00:24.029> CDs<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.960> wheels

normally make not using CDs for wheels

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.570 
normally make not using CDs for wheels
for<00:00:25.590> example<00:00:26.449> now<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.779> found<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:28.650> toy

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in my charity shop picked it up because

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.580 
in my charity shop picked it up because
it's<00:00:34.469> got<00:00:34.620> nice<00:00:34.829> rubber<00:00:35.520> tyres<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's got nice rubber tyres and one of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
it's got nice rubber tyres and one of
the<00:00:37.680> problems<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.370> small<00:00:39.059> rubberband

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the problems with small rubberband

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.580 
the problems with small rubberband
powered<00:00:40.469> cars<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.579> getting<00:00:41.940> enough<00:00:42.180> grit<00:00:42.590> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
powered cars is getting enough grit so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.479 
powered cars is getting enough grit so
I'll<00:00:44.489> use<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> wheels<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I'll use the wheels from here so that I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
I'll use the wheels from here so that I
get<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> reasonable<00:00:47.910> amount<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> grip<00:00:49.430> I'm

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
get a reasonable amount of grip I'm

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
get a reasonable amount of grip I'm
thinking<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.329> store<00:00:51.750> card

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
thinking of using this store card

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.770 
thinking of using this store card
thus<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.789> chassis<00:00:55.039> I'll<00:00:56.039> put<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> couple<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
thus the chassis I'll put a couple of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.069 
thus the chassis I'll put a couple of
drinking<00:00:57.780> straws<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.530> either<00:00:58.710> end<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.309> the

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
drinking straws on either end for the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.670 
drinking straws on either end for the
tubes<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> axles<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.160> through<00:01:03.680> attach

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tubes for the axles to go through attach

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.450 
tubes for the axles to go through attach
a<00:01:04.830> rubber<00:01:05.040> band<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.860> see<00:01:07.860> how<00:01:08.010> far<00:01:08.280> we

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
a rubber band to it and see how far we

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.300 
a rubber band to it and see how far we
can<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.930> I've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> wheels

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
can make it go right I've got the wheels

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.260 
can make it go right I've got the wheels
and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> axles<00:01:12.240> off<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.780> toy<00:01:12.990> car<00:01:13.939> I've<00:01:14.939> cut

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and the axles off that toy car I've cut

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
and the axles off that toy car I've cut

of drinking straw I've cut up those will
be<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> tubes<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> axles<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.700> through

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
be the tubes that the axles go through

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.800 
be the tubes that the axles go through
I'll<00:01:31.170> hot<00:01:31.500> glue<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> place

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
I'll hot glue that all in place

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
I'll hot glue that all in place
that's<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> drinking<00:01:34.439> straws<00:01:34.860> hot<00:01:35.670> glued<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.270 

there<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.070> are

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there we are

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.429 
there we are
that's<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.290> wheels<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> axles<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.189> place<00:01:51.439> now

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that's the wheels and axles in place now

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
that's the wheels and axles in place now
we<00:01:52.500> need<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> rubber<00:01:53.040> band

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we need a rubber band

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.410 
we need a rubber band
and<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.810> definitely<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.700> powerful

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and we definitely do not want a powerful

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.859 
and we definitely do not want a powerful
rubber<00:01:57.990> band<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:59.820> want<00:01:59.969> something<00:02:00.390> fairly

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
rubber band we want something fairly

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.109 
rubber band we want something fairly
weak<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:02.810> think<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:03.960> I'll<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.320> probably

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
weak I think what I'll do is probably

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.030 
weak I think what I'll do is probably
cut<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.910 

taeyeon<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> front<00:02:13.610> here<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:15.260> just<00:02:15.680> use

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
taeyeon to the front here and just use

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.309 
taeyeon to the front here and just use
it<00:02:16.099> as<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.250> single<00:02:16.730> length<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.720> wrap<00:02:17.900> around<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
it as a single length to wrap around the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.759 
it as a single length to wrap around the
axle<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:20.019> don't<00:02:21.019> think<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:21.319> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> get<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
axle I don't think I'm going to get the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.940 
axle I don't think I'm going to get the
full<00:02:21.980> 5<00:02:22.489> meters<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.300> kitchen<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.739> I'm<00:02:24.830> going

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
full 5 meters of my kitchen so I'm going

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.309 
full 5 meters of my kitchen so I'm going
to<00:02:24.980> give<00:02:25.129> it<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> run<00:02:25.519> over<00:02:25.910> my<00:02:26.239> measured<00:02:26.930> three

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
to give it a run over my measured three

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.350 
to give it a run over my measured three
meters<00:02:27.799> that's<00:02:28.099> already<00:02:28.430> marked<00:02:28.849> out<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
meters that's already marked out on the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.100 
meters that's already marked out on the
floor<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.340> red<00:02:31.610> line<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.330> start<00:02:32.720> line

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
floor so this red line is the start line
