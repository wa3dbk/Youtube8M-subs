juice it's kind of gross but that's what

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.479 
juice it's kind of gross but that's what
it<00:02:53.980> looks<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:56.049> we're<00:02:56.349> gonna<00:02:56.500> push<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.129> on

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
it looks like so we're gonna push it on

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.170 
it looks like so we're gonna push it on
through<00:02:59.159> and<00:03:00.159> let's<00:03:00.549> see<00:03:00.700> what<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.940> patty

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
through and let's see what the patty

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.750 
through and let's see what the patty
looks<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.859> so<00:03:02.859> here's<00:03:03.220> my<00:03:04.090> finished<00:03:04.629> patty

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
looks like so here's my finished patty

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.009 
looks like so here's my finished patty
it<00:03:06.760> was<00:03:06.909> a<00:03:06.940> little<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.299> put<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.629> meat<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
it was a little I put the meat in a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.690 
it was a little I put the meat in a
little<00:03:08.230> bit<00:03:08.319> uneven<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:08.890> obviously<00:03:09.489> when<00:03:09.609> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
little bit uneven but obviously when you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.130 
little bit uneven but obviously when you
press<00:03:09.909> down<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:10.269> gonna<00:03:10.390> press<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.900> into<00:03:11.049> a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
press down it's gonna press it into a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.670 
press down it's gonna press it into a
patty<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.730> think<00:03:13.690> if<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.810> put<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.409> meat<00:03:14.650> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
patty I think if I put it the meat a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.550 
patty I think if I put it the meat a
little<00:03:14.859> bit<00:03:15.010> more<00:03:15.359> even<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.599> inside<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.410> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
little bit more even and inside it it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.379 
little bit more even and inside it it
would<00:03:17.680> have<00:03:17.709> made<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> better<00:03:18.250> patty<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:18.819> there

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
would have made a better patty but there

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.039 
would have made a better patty but there
you<00:03:19.569> go<00:03:20.069> does<00:03:21.069> what<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.340> says<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:22.000> does<00:03:22.299> it's

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
you go does what it says it it does it's

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.990 
you go does what it says it it does it's
kind<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.349> cool<00:03:23.500> idea<00:03:23.639> especially<00:03:24.639> if<00:03:24.849> you're

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
kind of a cool idea especially if you're

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.129 
kind of a cool idea especially if you're
making<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.299> lot<00:03:25.329> of<00:03:25.540> burgers<00:03:25.870> for<00:03:25.989> like<00:03:26.109> a

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
barbecue and once again I mean this is a

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.930 
barbecue and once again I mean this is a
product<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.079> takes<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.470> space<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.639> it's<00:03:30.879> just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
product that takes up space so it's just

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460
