well<00:00:09.000> we're<00:00:09.210> up<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.629> five<00:00:09.930> real<00:00:10.200> kick

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
well we're up to that five real kick

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.410 
well we're up to that five real kick
system<00:00:10.889> now<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.459> called<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.760> twice<00:00:12.030> around

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
system now this is called a twice around

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.480 
system now this is called a twice around
the<00:00:12.570> table<00:00:12.990> system<00:00:13.260> what<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.219> do

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the table system what we're gonna do

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.650 
the table system what we're gonna do
here<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:14.880> gonna<00:00:14.969> shoot<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.420> cue<00:00:15.630> ball

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
here is we're gonna shoot a cue ball

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.510 
here is we're gonna shoot a cue ball
five<00:00:16.110> cushions<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.890> make<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.099> ball<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
five cushions and make a ball in the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.120 
five cushions and make a ball in the
corner<00:00:17.730> pocket<00:00:17.990> now<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> very<00:00:19.740> easy

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
corner pocket now this is a very easy

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.729 
corner pocket now this is a very easy
system<00:00:20.669> to<00:00:20.730> calculate<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.540> you<00:00:22.050> come<00:00:22.259> over<00:00:22.380> one

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
system to calculate if you come over one

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.639 
system to calculate if you come over one
diamond<00:00:23.099> from<00:00:23.399> this<00:00:23.579> corner<00:00:23.910> pocket<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.649> you

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.649 
diamond from this corner pocket and you

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.859 
diamond from this corner pocket and you
come<00:00:25.919> down<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.700> diamond<00:00:27.059> from<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.570> corner

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
come down one diamond from that corner

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
come down one diamond from that corner
pocket<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.919> connect<00:00:29.279> those<00:00:29.430> two<00:00:29.700> points

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
pocket and you connect those two points

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.510 
pocket and you connect those two points
just<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.649> called<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:32.070> one-one

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
just like this that's called a one-one

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
just like this that's called a one-one
designator<00:00:33.120> track<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.260> shoot<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
designator track and when you shoot the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
designator track and when you shoot the
cue<00:00:34.770> ball<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.309> line<00:00:35.489> it'll<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
cue ball down that line it'll go all the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.849 
cue ball down that line it'll go all the
way<00:00:36.180> around<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> table<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> make<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.679> eight

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
way around the table and make that eight

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.040 
way around the table and make that eight
ball<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.760> come<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.329> diamonds<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
ball if you come over two diamonds and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
ball if you come over two diamonds and
come<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.039> two<00:00:41.250> diamonds<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.789> way<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
come down two diamonds that way and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.430 
come down two diamonds that way and
connect<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.690> another<00:00:42.899> designator

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
connect it you have another designator

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
connect it you have another designator
track<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.699> come<00:00:44.940> over<00:00:44.969> three<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
track and if you come over three and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.299 
track and if you come over three and
come<00:00:46.109> down<00:00:46.350> three<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.949> have<00:00:47.039> another

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
come down three you have another

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
come down three you have another
designator<00:00:47.820> track<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.899> those<00:00:49.140> tracks

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
designator track now all those tracks

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
designator track now all those tracks
will<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> eight<00:00:50.820> ball<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.149> corner

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
will make that eight ball in that corner

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.250 
will make that eight ball in that corner
pockets<00:00:51.749> now<00:00:51.839> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.109> demonstrate

we're gonna move over to diamonds by

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.180 
we're gonna move over to diamonds by
going<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.610> diamonds<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.040> coming<00:01:23.040> down

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
going over to diamonds and coming down

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.890 
going over to diamonds and coming down
to<00:01:23.250> diamonds<00:01:23.910> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.030> another<00:01:24.300> track<00:01:24.630> line

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
to diamonds we have another track line

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
to diamonds we have another track line
so<00:01:25.620> let's<00:01:25.800> shoot<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.370> when<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.550> put<00:01:26.730> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so let's shoot an on this when you put a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.070 
so let's shoot an on this when you put a
little<00:01:26.940> bit<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.120> English<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.660> further<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
little bit more English the further you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080 
little bit more English the further you
go<00:01:28.200> over<00:01:28.620> a<00:01:28.830> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:29.670> English<00:01:29.910> so<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
go over a little bit more English so on

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.160 
go over a little bit more English so on
the<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.360> thing<00:01:30.480> we<00:01:30.570> had<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.690> quarter<00:01:30.990> tip<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the first thing we had a quarter tip a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
the first thing we had a quarter tip a
write<00:01:31.410> English<00:01:31.710> approximately<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
write English approximately on this you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870 
write English approximately on this you
put<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.480> 3/8<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.230> 1/2<00:01:34.370> keep<00:01:35.370> your<00:01:35.520> speed<00:01:35.760> up

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
put about 3/8 to 1/2 keep your speed up

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.320 
put about 3/8 to 1/2 keep your speed up
again<00:01:36.000> nice<00:01:36.900> smooth<00:01:37.260> stroke<00:01:37.910> just<00:01:38.910> like<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
again nice smooth stroke just like that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.660 
again nice smooth stroke just like that
watch<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> cue<00:01:40.380> ball<00:01:40.560> watch<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.370> come<00:01:41.520> back

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
watch the cue ball watch you come back

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
watch the cue ball watch you come back
now<00:01:41.910> right<00:01:41.940> over<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> corner<00:01:43.440> pocket<00:01:43.620> so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
now right over to the corner pocket so
