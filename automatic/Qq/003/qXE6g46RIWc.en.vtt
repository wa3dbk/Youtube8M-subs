00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.069
 motorcycles are not different here we have the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.289
 most modern Reinke four-cylinder from Japan 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:14.549
 the Kawasaki zx-10r 210 hp are promised to us including frame he system 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.429
 And of course there are all electronic driving aids on board 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.570
 Here we have a goalkeeper who we have such a box made far from 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.579
 the company Wunderlich and Burgau and there goes the engine concept on the 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.199
 Thirties back 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.920
 we live here from a two-cylinder boxer engine the strongest with Kundert 20 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.960
 best we do not want to compare the two of course on the racetrack 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.060
 but we want to know how to beat these two vehicles everyday life 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.690
 the arena is a full - grown superbike and the other a box bike for the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.739
 Trends of upright driving 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.739
 the cubes could not be more different for that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 Actually this motorcycle can be used as a BMW hp2 sport on the world 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.810
 The strongest boxer boat running through the area has been delighted to see the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.530
 fans 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.020
 for the designers from the Eifel pour the sports equipment 5 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.140
 as far as noted 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.820
 a short tail of all kinds of fine ingredients bookted aluminum and one 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.250
 a lot of self-confidence we have the builders with us 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 but also technical improvements were attacked 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.300
 I'm the concept to design 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 the built-in case polarized 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.729
 It looks different in the Kawasaki from optically it is Japanese 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.170
 Standardware actually nothing exciting if there are not some 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.170
 technical treats would be 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.129
 while the air was at 9 for 6 10 r more than 200 hp on anything for the weak 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.469
 Nervous to spaces here especially the driver should be aware of that 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.130
 Performance potential of catwalk awareness 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.130
 that calls for a mental start 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.849
 both motorcycles show an excellent driving behavior 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.749
 the spring elements speaking title 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.430
 and can not be disturbed even on bad roads like 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.179
 However, discussion on the highway are still a bit too tight 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.789
 Voted 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.449
 the seating positions are a matter of taste one likes to sit upright the other 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.449
 prefers a depth and 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.609
 comes to the conclusion then compares our unequal sisters 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.099
 the BMW hp2 sport has 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.159
 The basis for this is not delivered Cruiser and installed there until everything 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.939
 what has been good and expensive is automatic switch 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.379
 is standard here then once when the sport even in the mosque 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:28.719
 PI is used and in addition the Salsa arms motor boxer engine says 120 hp DRI moment 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.989
 The engine serves as a supporting element and the chassis 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:33.750
 a dream 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.970
 KÃ¶nigsborn the federation wants of course 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.819
 these include the over 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.829
 Xtreme braking benefits even when lodging offers 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.139
 120 hp 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.689
 200 hp but there is no discipline where the like on the web dievini deep 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.599
 must win 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.599
 that's the liberation blow 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.319
 he 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
 Feb. 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.429
 The motto is already broad on the kawasaki syndrome 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.829
 Let's see how the bike is 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.829
 Winston Churchill EKD 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:24.099
 There succeed 200 hp at the zx-10r we have a princess table number 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.080
 44 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.580
 from 100 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.249
 Siren moderately direct Akrapovic information from board 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:31.529
 the beautiful here 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.110
 is at the machine 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.099
 the traction control as far as weird 0 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.029
 that means in plain language 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.469
 the traction control does not govern on the throttle 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:47.219
 but therefore each team calculates possible condition prerequisite 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:52.879
 and has already ruled on it before density ever moved my hand 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.290
 sounds complicated 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.650
 APA is a free race but he is also on board and that 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.120
 The only thing we do not understand is that the machine does not have an automatic switch 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 Otherwise, everything is really built around fast on the street or 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.849
 Trend strength to drive 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.729
 Best 4 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.749
 how is the BMW in its element as possible on the highway 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.879
 let the soul dangle so makes motorcycling fun 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.719
 As mentioned earlier, the cruisers have a switch to do that 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.199
 It also means designing without a clutch 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.779
 the zx-10r shines with other apps of the newest generation 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.759
 That brings safety for the driver 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.430
 a bit annoying we found the placement of the plate to the BND 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.659
 too much Hollywood for our taste 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.419
 our fans are at just under 1500 euros, the Kawasaki still costs half as much 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.800
 How the bees go who but with his bike cause a stir, I should 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.379
 I came to see the exclusive video premiere
