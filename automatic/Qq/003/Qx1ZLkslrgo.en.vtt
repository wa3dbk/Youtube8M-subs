00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.510
 so my dear friends rocket heartily 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.119
 Welcome to a new video with me 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.869
 in the channel and I would like to see you today 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.940
 Let's introduce the rocket power grid app 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 yes this app already exists 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.560
 few months in the market and I have 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 they are really long and detailed 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.269
 can also test it and not only 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.970
 in daily use but also stop 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.649
 just like that by the way 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.660
 to try a little but also 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.520
 to say how does it all work for me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.829
 that with the mobile phone tax because the app 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.510
 is completely independent of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 any rock it products 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 that means you can also use the app 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.540
 download if you do not rocket 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.800
 The product uses the up free one 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.500
 First, it can be on the phone 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 download or the possibility exists 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 that you download them on the pc 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.259
 the version you are here before you now 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 See this is the version you are on 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.340
 pc can download 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.190
 now certainly asked what should i do with it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.649
 the thing 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 well you can call it simple 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.450
 This part here so that there is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.440
 the power grid this is the so-called 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 lounge in the launcher you have different 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.810
 predefined short we'll take a look 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 time and shows the following 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.459
 predefined works in comic 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.399
 Of course you can do that center 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.330
 different actions 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.069
 program like for example 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.899
 facebook skype or e-mails or 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.149
 similar is that it just kind of like that 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.700
 notification service on the other 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.789
 side there is the system status so that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.610
 System always means that is ours 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.560
 cpu info how much space is up to date 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.989
 available how much net usage i have 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 What kind of hard drives are they? 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.739
 busy so you can also zac 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.789
 directly with a mouse click on the 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.349
 hard disk come 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.200
 Of course, that's all a thing 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.819
 the very very cool man you have 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.870
 really the possibility the whole 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.020
 perfect to control 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.150
 That's the area in this direction 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 I will be a pensioner here too 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.550
 in short, let's just look at the summer 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.000
 gradually 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.250
 the third reason here is the predefined one 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.470
 the sound control with the sound control 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
 i can control music i can listen to music 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.610
 to make out of myself I can do here 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.920
 make loud and quiet 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.800
 that's pretty nice if you do not yourself 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.230
 sits at the computer and has the app on 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.730
 handy if you of course over here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.710
 the program controls it is also very 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 helpful if you can of course then 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.950
 simultaneously control all of its player 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.690
 and then, of course, loudly quietly 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 Of course, doing it is practical if you do 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.320
 everything in a program then there 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.650
 Last but not least, this is one of the top picks 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.900
 Thing 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 there we have the possibility that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.710
 to use as a predefined grid 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.370
 Here we can do things accordingly 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.830
 adjust that the lighting effects 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.180
 that means you can do the whole thing 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.530
 You can say that they red, for example 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.360
 make it you can make it blink 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.550
 Can it be called briefing in the end 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.160
 This breathable effect can be one 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.750
 make heart or heart rhythm 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.790
 Of course you can do that too 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.160
 Add is a very nice thing 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.290
 but I personally do not think so now 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.570
 helpful so that's a flu that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.140
 I do not necessarily need my grids 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.400
 which I really really like to use 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.380
 Apart from the rags and in the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.850
 calculator that's not the stuff 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.150
 I've got that on my keyboard 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.150
 m1 thus on the additional costs and on m 2 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.700
 For example , there is something very cool 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.190
 is is windows control windows control 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.680
 1 - account 2 I have the here 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.600
 possibility over certain fast buttons 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
 To select all I can here zack 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.750
 I can enter directly into the controls 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.790
 directly into my system 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.350
 I can clean the open tasks I can 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.720
 the programs rheine the options me 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.910
 Can you edit those are louder things 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.739
 are really easy and you can 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.280
 this program very very fast too 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.870
 use 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 and the beautiful is as before 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.590
 You do not need a skirts keyboard 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.330
 no mouse keyboard no skirts products 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.180
 to use that 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.970
 in the second step from the windows 7 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.410
 Control is as much a thing as a state folder 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.050
 looking here pc search windows holds 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.070
 Minimize windows that is 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.830
 really cool 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.030
 You can also create grids yourself 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.550
 and you can do it yourself 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.260
 program out on this topic 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.640
 I'll be there when I get the keyboard 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.420
 which I now have before me 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.010
 imagine 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.090
 because that's part of it, you have to 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.880
 you absolutely have to look at the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.780
 keyboard the new from roccat this 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.820
 really cool so the new keyboard the 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.380
 rhymes the mechanical ones of roccat 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.670
 I can only really recommend you 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.250
 but then we 'll look at each other the next 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.870
 video the whole course 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.580
 what does these areas mean below 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.340
 this area down here are the 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.300
 quick at choice points you have 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.320
 also on the phone for example 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.540
 available 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.800
 that means you can fix it relatively fast 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.120
 if you had so to say yours 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.590
 Mobile phone as a control device for the pc and the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.150
 it's really a matter of me 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.100
 I can find absolutely cool then 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.140
 my music is loud and loud at the klo rock 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.240
 quietly next song I can do mine 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.830
 put pc in sleep mode 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.050
 you only need an active one 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.960
 connection that means I can my pc 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.970
 for example, let and could 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.520
 a distance where I am now on this 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.330
 Network can easily access the pc 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.620
 check 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.660
 Of course that is very cool if you 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.170
 I forget to shut down my pc 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.820
 drive 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.700
 These are louder things I think 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.260
 really cool because that will be 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.419
 someday to be my future that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.650
 you have the possibility of light in the 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.030
 It is now possible to control your apartment 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.100
 Of course, it's very expensive 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.680
 but that is already in the right place 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.450
 Direction just for your pc 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.310
 now I would go from your side 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.260
 like to know what do you think about that 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.669
 a part you find something absolutely 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.500
 unnecessarily he said I do it better 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.240
 So we are looking for the whole thing 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.950
 or said haye may be cool for 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.540
 someone who is unfamiliar with pc 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.950
 he says where do I find the windows 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.780
 the options where do I find 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.550
 network settings where do I find the 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.800
 that's how I find it and that's how I have it 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.000
 a fast control function so to speak 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.500
 above all 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.050
 I have to be honest with the editor 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.400
 I would not go there what 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.200
 I just do not know about it 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.490
 as well as I say that 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.950
 settings because you've got to now 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.990
 I do not have to deal with that 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.510
 only the added clear one has also 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.160
 the support page so that if you 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.960
 but I have any questions 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.070
 I deal with the grid side that 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.690
 is enough then accordingly 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.400
 Write me in the comments 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.530
 what you say to the part holder 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.950
 absolute bullshit or really horny 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.990
 part 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.580
 So I finds really cool because it 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.080
 really makes me feel better when i do 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.940
 I always have my mobile next to me 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.380
 can control my pc with it and 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.700
 control and that is really 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.490
 really cool 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.500
 until the next video out here 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.970
 stay clean until next time 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.970
 unlike so far
