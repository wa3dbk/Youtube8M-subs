lost<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> tank<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.159> did<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> live<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
lost the tank when I did that live the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
lost the tank when I did that live the
live<00:01:51.270> playthrough<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
live playthrough and I was I think was a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.929 
live playthrough and I was I think was a
level<00:01:53.369> 33<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.360> stage<00:01:54.630> 5<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> 33<00:01:56.430> years<00:01:56.579> i

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
level 33 the stage 5 was it 33 years i

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
level 33 the stage 5 was it 33 years i
think<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.329> 33<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:57.960> 31<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.500> something<00:01:58.680> like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
think it was 33 or 31 or something like
