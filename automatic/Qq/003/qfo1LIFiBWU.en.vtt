 remains with stillwater saint row 2 this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 game is developed after the end 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 of the first game the protagonist who 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 he was burned and locked in jail 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.250
 of stealwater for a long time that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 until most of the saints are 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 they dissolved a man named Carlos 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.550
 helps escape when the protagonist 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.460
 he had already recovered after 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.960
 escape the protagonist seeks to link a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 helps to escape from the trial by multiple 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.409
 Little Saint Row say the game for some 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 reason I do not know is not called saint row 3 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.399
 and left the development serious and now it's 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.500
 funnier the game is no longer 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.330

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.950
 bail of the saints and they take them to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.750
 an airplane above this port and then 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 they know a man called phillip who 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.830
 is the leader of the trade unions to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.080
 he proposed that they give them full control 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.330
 of stealwater but they reject it and that's why 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.369
 they want to kill them but I do not eat them 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.890
 ok bastard gets rid of the chair in the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.170
 that was bound and unleashes the others the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.330
 protagonist and sound and try to get out of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.370
 plane but young and decided to stay at 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.530
 fight against unions before 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.540
 that the two left the plane tell him 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 and on an intercom that await you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.350
 in stillwater but shots are heard 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.390
 on the intercom and they think that 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.160
 johnny is supposedly dead and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.410
 after jumping from there the protagonist 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.180
 save sound and fall into a 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 after that they try to grab money 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.390
 of the saints account but a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 The union's hacker empties his account 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
 and they run out of money and that's where the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.069
 way to take revenge on the unions 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.140
 saint row 4 in this game and everything changes 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.260
 radically since you are now in the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.480
 space again the protagonist is the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.610

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.340
 the protagonist gets on the rocket to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.230
