00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.070
 hello very good everyone I'm margarita 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.180
 daisy nitin and I'm here one more time 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.670
 to bring you a new video of the course 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 basic to learn crochet and to the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.790
 last week he posted a video about 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 we learned about how to start and 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.820
 it ends a job of the chillos because in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.460
 this time I will teach you both 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.640
 first basic points 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 the chain stitch and the low stitch or 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.509
 also called half point 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.659
 is all together , you can already 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.490
 ok start making some tidbits worth 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.770
 Well let's start with the point 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.950
 chain your symbol is this 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.679
 ok every time we see this symbol in 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.719
 a graphic or in a pattern we know what 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.439
 what we have to do is a point 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.170
 chain ok now let's put the video 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.550
 of how the chain stitch is made 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.180
 for right-handers 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.680
 well, to show you how to do the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.300
 chain stitch for it I have to do 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.250
 a beginning of the work that already 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.330
 We learned to do in the previous video 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 true 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 so the chain stitch is simply 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 is done by taking a new thread and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.860
 introducing the one we already have 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.230
 inside the hook it is worth repeating we take 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 new thread and we introduce it into 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.790
 the one we already have on the hook 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.300
 each one each time we make a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.690
 movement of these is a chain stitch 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.060
 you see that it is very simple ok 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.960
 well nothing with this we know how to do the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960
 chain stitch 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.730
 good and now it's up to the lefties 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 Well, let's repeat for the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.640
 left-handed we make a start of the work 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 as I already showed you in the previous video 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.030
 ok and now simply the chain stitch 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.019
 it does 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.439
 taking a new thread and entering the 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.629
 why we already have on the hook or that 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.120
 we repeat we take new thread and the 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.750
 we introduce in the one we already have inside 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.459
 of the hook and so constantly every time 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.730
 that we make this movement is a point 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.659
 cadeneta ok well nothing with this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.799
 we do know 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.799
 the chain stitch 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.959
 Well, we already know how to make the first 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.050
 crochet basic point or also 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.290
 called crochet 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.530
 we go with the second the second the point 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.090
 under the half point of ok your symbol is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.640
 this 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.400
 it's worth so every time this symbol 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.650
 in a pattern or in a graph we know that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.950
 what we have to knit is a point 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.620
 low or half a point ok let's see now 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.690
 how this point is made for the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.210
 Right-handed 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.130
 good to draw a low point before 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.730
 that nothing needs to be clarified that we need 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.260
 have already made some point is worth not 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.320
 it has to be a chainlet it can be 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.810
 any point is good for what 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.860
 which is the elaboration of the low point what 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.940
 first thing to do is introduce 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.240
 the hook at the point where it will go 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.820
 you take a strand and go through only the 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.040
 point is worth which we are left with 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.560
 two strands inside the hook and now 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.330
 we just take a new thread and the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.540
 we went through the two that already 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.210
 we had inside the hook we repeated 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.890
 we introduce the hook by the point 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.370
 we take a new thread and we pass it 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.220
 only for the point it is worth we are left 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.200
 two strands inside the hook, because nothing 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.750
 now we just take a strand 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.540
 new and we passed it inside the two 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.840
 that we already had on the hook and that's how it is 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.300
 how a low point is made or also 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.190
 called half point ok 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.500
 it's just passing the hook through 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.449
 inside the point taking thread 9 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.809
 closing 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:50.110
 You see is very simple because nothing with 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:55.499
 this we know how the point is made under 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.499
 or also called half point 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.410
 and now it's up to the lefties 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.680
 Well, let's repeat for the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.770
 left-handed already as I said before we need 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.140
 have a point already prepared for 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.850
 begin to perform the low point no 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.490
 it has why chain can be 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.560
 any point ok then it's good for 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.660
 start making a point down we have 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.220
 to introduce the hook at the point 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.890
 where are you going 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.200
 we take a thread and pass it only by 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.810
 below the point for which we are left 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.060
 two strands inside the hook, because nothing 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.920
 now we just take new thread and 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.550
 we introduce it by the two that already 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.320
 we had and already with this is the low 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.020
 we repeat we introduce the hook inside 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.170
 from the point we take new thread and the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.870
 we went just below the point we 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.850
 two strands remain inside the hook 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.550
 nothing now we simply take strand 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:55.270
 new and we introduce it by the two that 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.810
 we already had on the hook and this ladies 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.030
 and gentlemen , is how low is 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.060
 or also called half point 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.200
 much simpler than people 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.720
 imagine is simply to introduce the 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.640
 hook inside the point 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.520
 we take a thread and now we close the two 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.030
 of the hook is worth it already with this we know 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.570
 how low or half a point is made 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.570
 low 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.190
 that is very simple truth is that 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.580
 who says that chivas complicated is 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.620
 because he does not know how to weave quarrels 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.810
 you know we already have these first two 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.200
 points and now you have to practice 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.870
 practice practicing voucher when you drive 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.450
 well in stitch chain past the stitch 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.880
 low and this how you get doing and 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.120
 undoing doing and undoing vale 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.940
 do not hurry because not to go faster 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.430
 you're going to get better better so 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.980
 to handle myself in the internalized points 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.440
 well and memorize your symbols of those 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.930
 graphics because then so everything will be 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.300
 much more fun and fun when 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.420
 let's do more complicated work 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.430
 next week the following Friday 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.830
 You can not lose what you because I will 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.350
 teach the next two that are the 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.260
 half point act also called media 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.620
 greta or the art point also called 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.100
 boat is worth it so I leave you practicing 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.470
 this week these two points 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.900
 and we see a little kiss next week 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.250
 very cute 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.130
 and by the way do not forget about 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.870
 subscribe to the channel worth an end 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.350
