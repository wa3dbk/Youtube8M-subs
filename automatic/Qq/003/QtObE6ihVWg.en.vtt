we'll go ahead and tap play this is what

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.279 
we'll go ahead and tap play this is what
the<00:00:26.849> game<00:00:27.060> board<00:00:27.330> looks<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.660> you're<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the game board looks like you're the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
the game board looks like you're the
black<00:00:28.500> dot<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:29.160> goal<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.730> move<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:30.210> line

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
black dot your goal is to move from line

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.160 
black dot your goal is to move from line
to<00:00:30.900> line<00:00:31.040> without<00:00:32.040> hitting<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.750> White<00:00:33.930> done

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
to line without hitting the White done

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.729 
to line without hitting the White done
well<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> seems<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.309> simple<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
well it seems pretty simple but as you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.389 
well it seems pretty simple but as you
can<00:00:37.980> probably<00:00:38.370> guess<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.250> see

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
can probably guess it's not you can see

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
can probably guess it's not you can see
on<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> left<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.510> current<00:00:42.809> score<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
on the left your current score on the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
on the left your current score on the
right<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.850> high<00:00:45.149> score<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.510> was

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
right is your high score that was

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.090 
right is your high score that was
horrible<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.829> anyway<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> could<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.469> jumpy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
horrible but anyway you could see jumpy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
horrible but anyway you could see jumpy
lines<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:54.149> kind<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:54.930> flappy<00:00:55.620> bird<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
lines it's kind of like flappy bird in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
lines it's kind of like flappy bird in
the<00:00:57.180> sense<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.460> goal<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.359> simple

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the sense that the goal is really simple

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.759 
the sense that the goal is really simple
and<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.190> game<00:01:02.520> itself<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.420> simple<00:01:03.840> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and the game itself is really simple but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
and the game itself is really simple but
it's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.549> easy<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> also<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.500> wanna

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it's not easy at all and also I do wanna

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.750 
it's not easy at all and also I do wanna
mention<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.270> unlock<00:01:09.540> surprises<00:01:10.760> by

mention that you can unlock surprises by

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
mention that you can unlock surprises by
playing<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.330> game<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.799> changing<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
playing the game that's for changing the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.539 
playing the game that's for changing the
background<00:01:14.549> color<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.380> jumpy<00:01:16.380> line<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> also

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
background color of jumpy line and also

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149 
background color of jumpy line and also
you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.880> disable<00:01:18.180> ads<00:01:18.630> via<00:01:19.200> in-app<00:01:19.619> purchase

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.850 

so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.259> once<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so you can see once you kind of get the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.380 
so you can see once you kind of get the
hang<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.899> jumpy<00:01:36.899> line<00:01:37.970> your<00:01:38.970> score<00:01:39.299> will

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
hang of jumpy line your score will

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.620 
hang of jumpy line your score will
definitely<00:01:39.930> improve<00:01:40.580> but<00:01:41.580> it's<00:01:42.330> going<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
definitely improve but it's going to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:54.930 
definitely improve but it's going to
take<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.080> lot<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.770> time

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.310 

so<00:01:55.630> when<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.650> unlock<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.160> gifts<00:01:57.490> as<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.940> see

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
so when you unlock the gifts as you see

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.980 
so when you unlock the gifts as you see
all<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.710> does<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.210> allow<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.510> change<00:02:01.780> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
all it does is allow you to change the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.250 
all it does is allow you to change the
background<00:02:02.380> color<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:03.250> jumpy<00:02:03.940> line<00:02:04.150> which<00:02:05.080> is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
background color of jumpy line which is

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.140 
background color of jumpy line which is
pretty<00:02:05.410> cool<00:02:05.710> means<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.700> game<00:02:06.850> doesn't

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
pretty cool means the game doesn't

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.609 
pretty cool means the game doesn't
really<00:02:07.420> get<00:02:07.600> boring<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.080> see<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.380> color<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
really get boring you see the color of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:21.760 
really get boring you see the color of
the<00:02:08.860> dots<00:02:09.040> are<00:02:09.340> still<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> same

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.840 

so<00:02:22.640> overall<00:02:23.390> jumpy<00:02:24.380> line<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.980> game<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.700> I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
so overall jumpy line is a game that I

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720 
so overall jumpy line is a game that I
highly<00:02:26.480> recommend<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.220> addicting

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
highly recommend if you like addicting

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
highly recommend if you like addicting
games<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.270> flappy<00:02:29.690> bird<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.140> are<00:02:30.230> really

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
games like flappy bird that are really

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.290 
games like flappy bird that are really
frustrating<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.490> fun<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.880> watch<00:02:32.030> your
