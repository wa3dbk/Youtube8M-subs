00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.080
 I flew kids like they are, I hope that 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.379
 be of the worst 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.110
 nothing is created I wish you the best and good 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.180
 I am verÃ³n and full I am new on youtube 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.690
 but let's leave that aside and 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.120
 let's start this time I bring you a 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.220
 Escobedo gameplay and the chase 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.490
 cybernetics that is a video game based 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.870
 in the movie whose name is the same and 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.570
 I imagine that some of us 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.079
 we have already seen it at least some 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.780
 time and if not then neither way 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.750
 in this game was made for the console 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.270
 playstation 1 and the game boy advance 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.990
 I find it very entertaining despite its 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.390
 graphics 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.400
 what do we have to do in this game what 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.410
 what we have to do in this game is 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.410
 stop the villain called the virus 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.540
 ghost how we should do that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.580
 scooby and Segi must fight through 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.120
 seven levels to defeat him and his 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.920
 evil villains excellent always and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.710
 scooby and being the protagonists of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.980
 these admiring games of many and 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 excellent characters that I can most 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.760
 say but let's go on the road we can 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.250
 find what the scooby snacks 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.979
 for the points the scooby labels 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.560
 for lives the hamburgers for the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.390
 health and the cakes for the weapons that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.050
 I think they should have put more 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.229
 pastries because I needed them and I had 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.490
 to go to the level without some I had to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.420
 move to the level 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.579
 in danger of being killed but 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.950
 there's nothing to do I hope and you can 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.540
 understand better I will slowly make my 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.659
 aim to not waste the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 pastries and so you can continue with this 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.869
 nice gameplay of the best you can 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.720
 happen as we can see here we are in 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.840
 the checkpoint I just grabbed is 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.780
 something that when I die there I can 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 start from there no longer from the beginning 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.310
 it's a good thing there we're seeing 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.020
 let's discover that well how can we 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 see was enlarged that the cakes that do not 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.819
 they are serving until now I'm going well 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.790
 until now there is no longer there I already had 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.600
 some problems but let's continue moscow vi 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.280
 you can well 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 that I'll follow 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 if you pick up the cabins in a row they give you 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 they increase it by 5 and it is the most 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.130
 high I think for 5 I do not remember if there are 6 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.580
 but for 5 it would be nice to pick up the 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.920
 circus is a nickname they will not give you 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.560
 higher percentages you have to put together 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 the points one after the other so that you 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.170
 can you give that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 and well I'm going to sit here with our 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.870
 to see if it's not clear that we're not going 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.810
 let's neglect the bird with choose well 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.810
 there is little and I do not give it well 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.790
 a checkpoint now if I die I'll start 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.560
 from here we will continue is to write 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.560
 followed so that they give us more 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.720
 great with the care scooby went through 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.720
 because you did not give him 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.720
 all right 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.269
 While this is a scooby label us 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.030
 is going to give a life we have six now 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.849
 we have seven lines 14 cakes we're going 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.319
 on the right track as well as what they are for 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.670
 five of the largest amount that we 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.670
 can give scooby snacks 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.600
 and well let's go scooby ok hamburgers 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.950
 we have a full life we do not need 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.950
 but in case the doubts 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.300
 I had the other checkpoint 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.710
 this part of which was more difficult for me 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.590
 because I did not remember that I had to give 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.800
 double jump and always fell to the small 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.800
 River 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.610
 well let's write now if you touch the mere 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.610
 good 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.500
 and the great we come to the end 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:48.729
 and if we come home looking for the lenses 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.100
 of 2000 a login was not discovered 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.040

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.090
