00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 welcome to another video is me and eyes 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.750
 of pokemon and today we bring another 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.730
 top 5 to the channel a bit controversial already 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 that we will talk about some pokemon 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.500
 which to the great majority of the party 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.230
 of the public did not like to use and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 these are the legendary pokémon so 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 regular these are very strong pokemon and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.779
 clear very difficult to capture since 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.090
 they are pokemon which appear 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 only once in the game but in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.599
 this tone we will focus on the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 difficulty when capturing or the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.570
 status that these pokemon have but in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 its competitive use so we started in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 ranked number 5 we still have pokemon 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 which may seem very strong and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 inclusive that would hang on your tree 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 Christmas but do not be fooled by your 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 resident appearance of the third 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.809
 generation and pokemon with statistics 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.090
 incredible is touring and the pokemon of this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 post is a very strong pokémon with 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 great statistics a lot of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 different strategies 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 from super offensive being scalar 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 up to a completely variant 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.480
 defensive and even a variant a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040
 so annoying to fling this pokemon 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.900
 has a lot to offer as it has 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 many and very varied 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.820
 of use for this is that this pokemon what 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 we place at number 5 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 now going up to number 4 with a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.700
 pokemon that like its predecessor in 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.830
 this top is a pokemon that to simple 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.140
 seen if it can seem very tender and very 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.570
 sweet but at the minimum careless this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.909
 Pokemon can and will destroy everything 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.979
 pokemon team that will be dessert opposite 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.259
 the pokemon we're talking about is a victim and 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.570
 legendary fifth generation type 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.030
 fire and psychic type a legendary with 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.729
 equally highly enviable statistics 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.280
 and an incredible destructive power this 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.650
 pokemon usually go as attacker can be 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.899
 both physical and special some that 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.550
 another mixed variant or even store 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.220
 breaker but in itself the essence of this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.399
 pokemon is to be destroyer and good friends 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.960
 this would be number 4 now 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.640
 going to post number 3 we 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.009
 we found a pokemon visually 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.020
 amazing of my favorites when speaking in 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.450
 this topic but for now we just 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.190
 we will focus on its competitive use on 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 pokemon I speak always seems to go 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.269
 offensive and with just reasons since 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.340
 stands out in this aspect 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.310
 we talk about the powerful legendary dog 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.709
 second generation rayco how curious 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.990
 and ironically it is not a dog but good 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.460
 this is already another matter 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.650
 all the variants or at least the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.380
 standard of this legendary powerful are 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.410
 offensive can be from you going 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.020
 for being a solbes being this variant 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.000
 more resistant and probably the most 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.070
 difficult to use this pokemon that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.350
 is the one of your mine call but once 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.750
 is used well in nothing can stop it 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.480
 one of the gems of this pokemon is that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.840
 he only has a weakness which 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.760
 gives enough points in the number position 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.890
 2 and nothing to keep the position 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.590
 number 1 we have a pretty pokemon 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.960
 curious since it has more than one way and 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.270
 to be honest both love me 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.880
 pokemon of the trio of clouds the genius 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.770
 tornadoes both forms of this pokemon 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.560
 they are amazing competitively speaking 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.260
 one more used than the other but that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.270
 yes both very strong the most daring my 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.110
 favorite and we'll talk about the day 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.340
 today the totem form a variant 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.500
 totally offensive being perfect 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.630
 user for life sphere the vest 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.850
 has these two balance being the objects 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.520
 more used in the pokemon than by 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.090
 certain one has a great speed and both 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.890
 attack statistics 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.170
 and in the number 1 position my pokemon 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.840
 legendary favorite sixth pokemon 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.240
 generation of fairy type the strongest 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.340
 that we have seen in this top and inclusive 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.160
 spa the pull of the shooters is nothing 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 more and nothing less than being a pokémon 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.690
 amazing that can destroy everything 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.400
 pokemon that is put in front of you 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.800
 of the best bus movements 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.890
 check control if you do not take anything in the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.960
 team to stop this pokemon will be able 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.490
 destroy complete equipment though 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.680
 being the best strategy and 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.260
 probably the most used of this 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.240
 Pokemon Geocontrol is not the only 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.610
 since it has an infinity of variants 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.920
 since it can be from scart up 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.320
 completely defensive and for this by 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.600
 a lot of reasons more this pokemon 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.460
 without any doubt it is my legendary 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.140
 favorite and it's not but I think that 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.940
 it would be all for this top that I hope that 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.280
 they liked it very much already know that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.440
 if they liked it, I would appreciate infinitely 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.150
 a little hand up hopefully we can reach 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.970
 the small goal for this video so 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.740

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.750
