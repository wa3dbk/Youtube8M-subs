00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 hi friends i am starting a new picture 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 oil painting can even be said to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.950
 I already tried to draw a horse 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.570
 oil train and this is also significant 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 event because it will be my first 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.690
 life portrait oil 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 oil paint portrait I painted 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.730
 never color so try 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 draw see what happens not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 I know how many days the work will go well in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 In general, we go then we take the greenback we take 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 cinnamon and starting to paint the fund bye 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.360
 that is just sketchy and spot do not know 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 what comes of it I honestly don't know 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 how else to draw yesterday looked one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.399
 video lesson in the u-tube but this video 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 lesson and so one more and repeat what 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 showed this other especially traces 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.370
 I never painted this picture 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 oiled 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.649
 but I hope that something is not exactly 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.660
 it will just be the only thing 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 I hope that the portrait letter because we can 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 that butter it is much more difficult to paint 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 there is not a pencil as if there is not bending 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 something did not work out erased and then immediately 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.770
 oil brush much more difficult portrait 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.100
 do anything will try 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.860
 but my friends see that this portrait is me 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 I am writing though I am really writing 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 because without a brush namely finger 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.549
 This way I in youtube and looked and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 I liked it I decided to try not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.810
 I know what will come of it but to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 I do not know much the truth will be 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.229
 Do I seem to try to do okay 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.229
 go further 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.970
 subscriber downloaded but who turned on 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 let's take a little bit Seneca 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.790
 you did it yourself 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 So 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.430
 Well, I painted over everything schematically now 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.110
 I'll start to draw lighter grass 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.040
 then even more light even more light 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.120
 Well, all the moon itself and I'll start 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.700
 draw the details on the face to be 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 it seems almost eight in the evening already 3 days 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 work well and that's what I have already done 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 there is a theme schematically cutout it based on 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 color filled already almost drawn face 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.940
 I 've painted your left eye already nose 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
 drew me left to finish here 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.220
 here are the teeth and now draw 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.659
 second eye well i mean the face is almost already 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.180
 ready to darken a little bit later 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.560
 hair and start mean it will be necessary 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.629
 start drawing first 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.370
 darker then darker 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.109
 then brighter then brighter 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.150
 and then the brightest then these whites 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.769
 flowers and red flowers in general 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 working a lot yet ready 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.900
 only the main background color is the most 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.790
 dark who came to the end there 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.280
 third working day and already half 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.859
 eleventh evening and that's what i 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 I managed to draw well how am I to you 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.230
 showed schematically it all sketched 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.510
 but today I painted a face but I consider 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.090
 that the face principle is already ready yes a little bit 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.449
 hairstyle then black out and so on 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.430
 Olechka himself is ready so that 's it 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.349
 here is a little bit more cilia 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.349
 clarify and so the principle is so far away 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.199
 it looks cool in the street is already dark 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.629
 so like a little bit of something 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:56.510
 so little gray looks like a better day 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:59.489
 Looks like it's incredibly difficult but 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.799
 quietly it turns out that is, I think 2 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.349
 3 4 portrait will be much faster in 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.349
 of time I have completed the Academy with you 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.470
 draws then only in blue 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.549
 but I only like the blue color 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.979
 add violet it turns out somehow 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.650
 more more life or something I've been well, 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.389
 big here look here here 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.720
 purple added kabuto fossa lived before 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.760
 here is 90 a little bit violet so me 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.260
 it seems purple more fun set 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.539
 another corner of the workshop here is more 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.240
 light and see see yes like a face 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.250
 it's like the sun 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.020
 according to my idea it was before 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.060
 transmit this sunlight to the field will 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.710
 so bright 700 play 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.930
 differently but will stand out more and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.300
 will be 10 on the kabuto effect on the street in 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.830
 sunny day 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.110
 see, I am not in vain, I am dark on the spoon 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.639
 first rf but because this one is dark 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.889
 the plot looks very cool like 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.289
 as if the shadow of the body that is the body is not 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:57.229
 just a shadow is stuck in the box 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:59.330
 and it turns out the volume is already a day 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.919
 looks much better alive paints 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.620
 Now I â€™ll take it out to the street 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.780
 cooler because you still have to watch 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.400
 in the light of the day there all these flowers 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.190
 every camera looks beautiful 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.090
 pass for some reason because the lighting 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.830
 sucks and flashes when the light beats in 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.610
 the canvas back to the camera lens and 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.409
 it turns out 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.289
 of course such a picture is lit in life 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.110
 Society of the river per meter length 80 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.360
 centimeters tall she is so healthy in 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.139
 life is actually in the camera but the camera 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.210
 there is a camera can not transfer 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.729
 color correction is not quite a camera more 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.830
 dimmer I take off there are colors more 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.659
 yellow more green pays there 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.409
 purple bangs 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.060
 such a purple beautiful little bit 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.570
 disassembly must be removed so as not 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.509
 candle or everything is tight on the side must still 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.520
 normal lighting found left 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.560
 I only like to sign on 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.490
 claws happened here 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:05.440
 deep shadow beautiful bee cool 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.840
 the first oil portrait in life came out 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.669
 here is near yes if you look I am not you 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.759
 drew each and stalk petal 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:16.460
 pretty sketchy flowers and 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.440
 See the edges, I blured the background. 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.370
 reception using artists I repeated th 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.460
 tuba to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.460
 and the photographer to get attention 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.009
 the viewer focused on the center 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.990
 paintings at the moment the center is like 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.440
 once our face I even a little blouse 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.870
 blured down below so blurry did and if 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.570
 to look away from afar to watch it is clear that 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.360
 these edges are blurred center immediately rushes 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.860
 look here is the center of the picture 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.919
 tricks peeked from where 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.259
 prisoners and I liked it firstly even 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.300
 immediately visible fields in the foreground 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.500
 far-far where there is a blurry 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.210
 goes far it worked very well 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.889
 I stand here and can't stop looking at myself 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.330
 wildly like this picture at different 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.580
 lighting picture looks different 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.819
 but best of all in daylight of course 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.310
 look so paint more we 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:13.340
 really looks all the same day 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.740
 light is daylight of course it's a pity that 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.620
 you can not see the house can live 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.199
 be ever gonna make my exhibition 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.409
 when I accumulate pictures but this picture too 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:27.830
 no opinion will remain so it will be necessary 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.719
 draw a little bit for yourself so you can 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.979
 there was a little bit on how these pictures do 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:38.629
 exhibition okay friends already in time 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:43.759
 Aganim pulled out his stories at last 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:47.259
 elderly as usual health to all good and 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.259
 to new meetings bye
