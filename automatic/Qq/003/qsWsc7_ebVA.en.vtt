00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.830
 to people today I'm going to bring you a 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.449
 form an alternative on how to 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.070
 install pando now I think it's 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.900
 pandora's in case someone does not know him 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.020
 things that I do not believe when you're like a 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.690
 radio station where further away 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.310
 a radio station we can choose to 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.810
 our singers that he likes and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 we automatically hear all your 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 topics too 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.890
 you drift 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 different kind of music genre 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.910
 that you like for example to say something 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 the reggaeton and they are putting different 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.129
 branches of reggaeton below this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.120
 application can only be installed 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.039
 If you live in the USA 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.230
 but as everyone knows there is 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.820
 alternatives to do so there are many 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.899
 people who say that you have to 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.500
 create an itunes account with an idea 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.440
 from us a tall count of us 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.360
 maipo del ayto sorry for itunes 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.390
 American and it would not be useful for your country 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.390
 well today I'm going to show that that's not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.940
 it takes to do it because they ask you 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 an itunes account is to be able to 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.990
 download the application not for anything else 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.909
 as everyone knows we have 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.780
 alternatives to download maya 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.800
 that was not the same actor 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.510
 for say 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.820
 alternatives this light that are all 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.020
 these there are more than 11 alternative insalud 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.330
 where we with us select a 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.080
 we downloaded the application pandora that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.080
 first we have to do 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.580
 we select here 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.100
 when I have it now, it is already 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100
 installed 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.140
 I'm going 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.140
 here now what will happen if I open it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.690
 it will not load well because 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.410
 we have to create an account we have to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.500
 do 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.810
 change the ip of our iphone 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 as you see here it says that I'm sorry but 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.300
 it is not possible for your country where you are 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.800
 but it is not compatible 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 good to do this 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.190
 we're going to go to the following as a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.730
 moment that we are going to close this that is not 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.730
 I want to open it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 we're going here we have to create a 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.450
 account 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 pl 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.330
 I have like 4 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.430
 and there are some places there are some 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.440
 servers or people who charge you for 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.520
 create this I 'm going to keep you 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.040
 quiet you I'll teach you a 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.200
 alternative to do it for free or if not 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.620
 I had a free alternative and the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.959
 Another is 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.960
 It's free but it's for a certain amount of 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.720
 minutes 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.880
 every time for a day is to say that in a 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.860
 day have number of minutes when 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.750
 it was cut off the next day it's going to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.330
 Rebuild but stay calm 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.040
 that there are alternatives to avoid that one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.090
 Once we have said this, we see here that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.849
 we have an icon 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.690
 he even keeps it here to activate it 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.690
 turn it off 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.810
 then let's go here let's finish this appears 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.849
 icon as it comes out here as we see it here 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.120
 now let's see if it works I'm going to 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.120
 open the application 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.890
 is going to ask you to register 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.730
 I'm registered so I'm not going 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.180
 to ask we're going to see this load 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.969
 Can be closed 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.760
 the application of one that is quiet 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.140
 will not reopen that is normal had 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.189
 past repeatedly until not me 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.719
 grab or depend on the vpn server that 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.719
 have according to the configuration 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.230
 since we have entered this application 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.060
 we can put the singers that 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.060
 we like to say 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.610
 as now 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.960
 the other account I needed to put the bread 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.370
 about why I asked 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.270
 as they see that I came back with again 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.520
 very well to be able to create the server 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.310
 vpn what we have to do first is 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.740
 go download this here I 'll 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.820
 ask for what is to 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.820

 in our email once 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.220
 we've put the email 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.330
 it will automatically send a link 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.539
 where we have to follow the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.629
 instructions to be able to do them when 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.860
 we have finished we open the link and what 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.630
 only thing that we have to do follows the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.390
 Steps 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.520
 number 1 place this number 2 and number 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.810

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.620
 that's what I showed earlier 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.150
 good my people that more than more good a 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.569
 once we have downloaded and have 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.669
 dead then I'm going to 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.969
 once you have reached our 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.969
 mail 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.650
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.260
 obviously open in our mail 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.540
 follow the instructions and we will 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.230
 find with these the number of 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.670
 account server and password 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.920
 also with the description the 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.080
 description and all that information 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.520
 because you are seeing now it will be 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.650
 in your new mail you have to do 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.650
 follow and paste the data and put it here 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.930
 let's activate it 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.139
 on purpose 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.509
 if you are getting to need these 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.089
 pandora's for our computer both 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.360
 regardless of the system 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:35.060
 operative plus windows linux do it to me 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.100
 know and with pleasure some video tutorial 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.790
 the same thing that goes on the iphone also 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.160
 send in our computer 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.310
 well we go back to our this we 're going to 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.310
 Activate 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.830
 once it is activated we return to 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.830
 again to pandora 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.399
 let's open it 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.050
 let's hope it charges a little 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.060
 it is very likely that the music does not 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.780
 listen because it's going to record my voice and 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.780
 no music 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.729
 let's have a second 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.479
 as they see right away that this is already 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:27.289
 walking if it will not have been an error we see 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.289

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.090
