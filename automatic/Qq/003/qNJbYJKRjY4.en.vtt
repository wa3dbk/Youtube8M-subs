00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.310
 Today we present the cover for you 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.509
 sony e-book reader 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.269
 prs t1 and t2 the same sheath because the 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:15.319
 model externally is equal we see that 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.109
 it comes in a small package of 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.720
 plastic is imitation leather truth 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.140
 is that it is for this type of covers 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 It was very good I bought it on ebay or 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.980
 ebay according to if you want to say it in 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 Spanish or English comes with a brooch 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.149
 magnetized 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.100
 and well it 's simple but it's 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.750
 padded also so it's going to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.190
 give enough security 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:48.109
 the reader would be included here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.109
 let's put it 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.930
 and we have it like that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.629
 you see good because this is the model t 2 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.579
 but I'm telling you, it's the appearance 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.190
 this one the dimensions are not the same 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.010
 that what for us then go t1 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.400
 to serve the same inn the only thing 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.790
 change between two then it is the next 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.710
 two in the keypad in relation to the high 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.630
 you do not have here is comfortable manageable as 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 is a 6-inch reader that is what 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.899
 it's been usual since it takes 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.340
 pretty good and good then now what 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.500
 they also see me in the package what they bought 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.330
 as I tell you on ebay and it has cost me 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.619
 both the cover and the little light 12 euros 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.179
 -11 with 95 in January 2014 well come 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.460
 very good light because good if not 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.310
 you want or you do not have a reader with light 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.580
 built-in that is the latest trend 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.410
 what vendors offer 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 for these good mistakes 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.740
 for 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.790
 and give added value because you have the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 possibility of buying a lamp 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.350
 external 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.110
 Well, this is the lamp that I've 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.820
 bought a bulb with a led diode 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.310
 and well, it comes with one with one 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.079
 small clamp to hold it 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.240
 but theirs in the back come 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.300
 the information in the advertising comes 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.830
 that is held here but here does more 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.220
 more strength and is in danger than we are 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.200
 run and the screen will be guided 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.750
 I prefer to place it because it comes with a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.780
 protector for batteries are three batteries 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.450
 button type the duration I do not think it's 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.250
 much although the LED consumes little 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.900
 been has not been removing exactly me 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.280
 It is made in China I do not know if you appreciate it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.660
 like almost everything even the wounded 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 although it is this is sony but 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 made holm oak and here what we have to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.170
 do is give the button 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.540
 take out exactly the function 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.900
 automatically it automatically comes out 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.420
 it will be introduced here and it is stopped and it comes out 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.260
 and it turns on 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 let's do the test now what 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.280
 we place here 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.110
 let's see what back works 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.110
 we defend the reader 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.890
 let's turn off the light and let's see what 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.120
 it illuminates we can adjust it in the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.000
 first test I do not know what is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.670
 illuminated 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.350
 I do not know I do not know I can put this 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.170
 a little more 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.170
 here is a little hole as you can see 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.140
 the one on the tab a little bit is not 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.320
 too comfortable but we're going to turn off the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.320
 light 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.880
 in near darkness as good as there 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 it has a lot of amplitude 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.140
 this what happens is that what has the 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.080
 Cillo spring with the Cillo spring 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.590
 have to place it in its position 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.170
 of shutdown does not leave us to move the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.080
 let's say the head with the light a little 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.120
 and well, well 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.480
 well, more or less although you see it in the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.460
 screen with enough lighting in 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.310
 actually it looks a little bit has a 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.150
 a little less light but enough 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.210
 to read some to read some some 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.770
 text 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.900
 pretty good if you want to read then in the 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.500
 bed somewhere that you do not have a 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.600
 light at a given time well the only thing 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.030
 as I tell you, it does not give much much 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.250
 opening are left or are shadow areas 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.710
 but good for the price they have then 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.030
 is not our biggest I say twelve euros 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.920
 so much the case that above all what I 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.110
 interested as the light that good the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.710
 Found about 08 euros eight euros and 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.570
 peak and for a few more euros bought the 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.000
 bombillita because this is what I wanted 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.820

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.580
 utility and that you subscribe to my channel
