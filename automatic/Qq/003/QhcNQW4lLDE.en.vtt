00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.140 
from virginmobile I got it about two or
three<00:00:13.269> weeks<00:00:13.420> ago<00:00:13.630> and<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:15.670> only<00:00:15.790> have<00:00:15.880> the

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
three weeks ago and they only have the

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.480 
three weeks ago and they only have the
lite<00:00:16.299> version<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:17.590> many<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.310> you<00:00:18.400> probably

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
lite version as many of you probably

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.340 
lite version as many of you probably
know<00:00:20.190> but<00:00:21.190> overall<00:00:21.760> so<00:00:22.210> far<00:00:22.480> this<00:00:22.869> phone<00:00:23.110> is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
know but overall so far this phone is

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.220 
know but overall so far this phone is
really<00:00:23.920> good<00:00:24.279> I<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:25.570> it's<00:00:25.690> one<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:25.990> best

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
really good I think it's one of the best

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.080 
really good I think it's one of the best
phones<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.830> they<00:00:26.949> have<00:00:27.130> actually<00:00:27.880> I<00:00:28.060> think

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
phones that they have actually I think

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.540 
phones that they have actually I think
it<00:00:28.270> is<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.630> best<00:00:28.660> phone<00:00:29.050> man<00:00:29.430> besides<00:00:30.430> the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
it is the best phone man besides the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.809 
it is the best phone man besides the
iphones<00:00:31.000> i<00:00:31.330> had<00:00:32.289> the<00:00:32.409> iphone<00:00:32.529> 4s<00:00:33.129> before<00:00:33.550> and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:33.819 
iphones i had the iphone 4s before and

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.119 
iphones i had the iphone 4s before and
the<00:00:34.600> screen<00:00:34.870> was<00:00:35.019> just<00:00:35.199> too<00:00:35.319> small<00:00:35.589> for<00:00:35.800> me<00:00:35.829> so

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
the screen was just too small for me so

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.919 
the screen was just too small for me so
i<00:00:36.159> had<00:00:36.399> to<00:00:36.579> get<00:00:37.269> a<00:00:37.329> bigger<00:00:37.569> screen<00:00:37.839> and<00:00:39.929> the

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
i had to get a bigger screen and the

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.840 
i had to get a bigger screen and the
galaxy<00:00:41.350> s3<00:00:41.769> is<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.729> same<00:00:43.409> its<00:00:44.579> base<00:00:45.579> i<00:00:45.789> think
