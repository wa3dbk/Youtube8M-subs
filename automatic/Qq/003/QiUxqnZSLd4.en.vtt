00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.300
 hello to all my social friends of the engines 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.340
 we are in france for the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 presentation of new through 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 maximum gargano company president 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.939
 and managing director of toyota 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.650
 motor italy is for everyone but if 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.570
 let's talk about the new man immediately 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 has changed has changed especially 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 outside because the design is there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.940
 substantially removes the new style 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.160
 of those in duke kind of eyes a little 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.690
 almond over the front of my 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 interior now is difficult because 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.530
 you should enter a salon and touch 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 with hand like everyone when buying a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 dress must touch it will touch the gown 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.649
 of a right thing in a car must 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.600
 bring all the normal points of 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 contact in the steering wheel guide and gearbox 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 the arm but also the plastics of the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.300
 placed at his feet he would realize that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.860
 there was an improvement on that of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 important in the videos that materials and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.220
 in his 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.170
 under the hood while confirming the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 four new classic two measurements 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 gasoline and two diesels 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.539
 so we worked on efficiency 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.890
 were the eyes on mikel emissions 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.750
 but above all it has improved the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.609
 dynamic behavior this car is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 very spacious internally but remains 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.490
 one received 5 6 7 posts but in reality 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.979
 in it is called two cars in 175 seats 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 why because thanks to a racist 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.909
 when we lower last row of 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.250
 seats becomes a real wood cycle with 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 Luggage up to the plate and lampposts but there 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.209
 also another thing to say about it 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.329
 noise and vibrations inside 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.159
 the car in the box has been corrected 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.649
 which are decrease then the is increased 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.289
 Company page worked a lot in 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.090
 terms of balance suspension but 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.369
 also the weight of life of that for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 which is certainly much more silent 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.950
 of task I can not previously a 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.950
 top levels of the category 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.260
 for the most demanding we also have in the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.360
 superior fittings the system 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.700
 those who approach this car are silent 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.909
 will not have the anxiety to say ok what is there 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.080
 put on this an active version 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.120
 fully equipped I do 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 another example from shingo and the other is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.150
 automatic climate control 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.000
 absolutely asking for help 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.200
 able to satisfy needs 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.480
 within a rational though 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.760
 ability to adapt punctually to each 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:51.530
 specific need typical of families 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:52.340
 of weight origin had begun in April 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.319
 on the price 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.420
 still being very distant naked yet 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.090
 worse than the launch price I can only 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.730
 to anticipate the price of 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.840
 price list starting from the car and 50 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.840
 while for the launch price
