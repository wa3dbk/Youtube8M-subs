so<00:01:01.590> before<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> start<00:01:02.010> cleaning<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> lens<00:01:03.059> I'll

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so before I start cleaning the lens I'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
so before I start cleaning the lens I'll
put<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.439> I'll<00:01:04.589> show<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> use

put it down and I'll show you what I use

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
put it down and I'll show you what I use
so<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.119> tool<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.570> lens<00:01:06.840> pen<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so the first tool is a lens pen you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
so the first tool is a lens pen you
might<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> heard<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.060> should<00:01:09.299> have

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
might have heard of this you should have

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
might have heard of this you should have
one<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:09.960> camera<00:01:10.290> bag<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:11.520> basically<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
one in your camera bag it's basically a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.800 
one in your camera bag it's basically a
brush<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> light<00:01:13.409> brush<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.810> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
brush on one side a light brush and it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
brush on one side a light brush and it
has<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> other<00:01:17.009> side

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
has this other thing on the other side

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.109 
has this other thing on the other side
which<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:19.220> I'm<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> call<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
which is I'm not sure what to call it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
which is I'm not sure what to call it
but<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> later<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.430> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but you will see me use it later on so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
but you will see me use it later on so
that's<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> try<00:01:26.369> to

that's of that and you want to try to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
that's of that and you want to try to
avoid<00:01:26.729> touching<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.390> bits<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
avoid touching those bits because you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.060 
avoid touching those bits because you
will<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.930> oils<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.619> skin<00:01:31.770> on

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
them and it might affect how it performs

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
them and it might affect how it performs
it<00:01:34.860> might<00:01:35.009> leave<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.720> residue<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.930> your

that<00:03:47.230> just<00:03:47.500> slowly<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.359> should<00:03:49.510> be<00:03:49.690> left

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
that just slowly and you should be left

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.330 
that just slowly and you should be left
with<00:03:49.989> almost<00:03:50.319> nothing<00:03:50.680> at<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.919> point

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
with almost nothing at this point

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.789 
with almost nothing at this point
or<00:03:51.459> nothing<00:03:52.120> at<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.389> point<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:53.410> there<00:03:53.680> is

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
or nothing at this point if there is

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.190 
or nothing at this point if there is
anything<00:03:54.069> it's<00:03:54.340> just<00:03:54.430> remaining<00:03:55.389> dust<00:03:55.810> specks

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
anything it's just remaining dust specks

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.400 
anything it's just remaining dust specks
that<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.620> usually<00:03:57.069> go<00:03:57.790> back<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.540> below<00:03:58.900> with

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
that I usually go back to and below with

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.330 
that I usually go back to and below with
the<00:03:59.530> rocket<00:03:59.829> blower<00:04:00.010> afterwards<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:02.340> you

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
the rocket blower afterwards and you

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.099 
the rocket blower afterwards and you
know<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.609> should<00:04:03.819> be<00:04:03.849> it<00:04:04.150> look<00:04:04.540> up<00:04:04.660> look<00:04:05.019> at

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
know that should be it look up look at

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.839 
know that should be it look up look at
how<00:04:05.410> shiny<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.099> clean

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
how shiny and clean

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.020 
how shiny and clean
that<00:04:07.359> front<00:04:07.599> lens<00:04:07.780> element<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.819> can

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
that front lens element is and you can

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.699 
that front lens element is and you can
do<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.359> same<00:04:10.599> with<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> rear<00:04:11.139> element<00:04:11.410> but

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
do the same with the rear element but

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.440 
do the same with the rear element but
again<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.069> rear<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.519> much<00:04:12.790> more<00:04:13.030> sensitive

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
again the rear is much more sensitive

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.529 
again the rear is much more sensitive
and<00:04:13.870> does<00:04:14.680> have<00:04:15.040> more<00:04:15.280> effect<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:15.790> how<00:04:16.030> you

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
and does have more effect on how you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.710 
and does have more effect on how you
know<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.810> lens<00:04:17.019> performs<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:19.359> I'd<00:04:19.539> be

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
know the lens performs so I'd be

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.599 
know the lens performs so I'd be
cautious<00:04:19.989> with<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.469> and<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.099> you<00:04:21.489> know<00:04:21.579> I

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
cautious with that and in the you know I

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.430 
cautious with that and in the you know I
try<00:04:21.909> not<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.240> get<00:04:22.330> anything<00:04:22.659> on<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:23.320> the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
try not to get anything on it in the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.090 
try not to get anything on it in the
first<00:04:23.650> place<00:04:23.890> but<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:24.789> much<00:04:25.300> more

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
first place but that's much more

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.920 
first place but that's much more
easily<00:04:26.490> avoidable<00:04:27.090> because<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.660> know<00:04:27.750> the

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
easily avoidable because you know the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.350 
easily avoidable because you know the
rear<00:04:28.110> element<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.880> practically<00:04:29.880> always

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
rear element is practically always

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.090 
rear element is practically always
covered<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.170> should<00:04:31.440> be<00:04:31.590> fine<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:31.800> that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
covered so you should be fine with that

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.290 
covered so you should be fine with that
now<00:04:32.970> I'm<00:04:33.600> going<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:34.020> go<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:35.580> talk<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:35.940> little

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
now I'm going to go just talk a little

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.090 
now I'm going to go just talk a little
bit<00:04:36.450> about<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.840> lens<00:04:37.050> barrel<00:04:37.320> but<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.920> is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
bit about the lens barrel but this is

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.530 
bit about the lens barrel but this is
you<00:04:38.250> know<00:04:38.340> pretty<00:04:38.610> much<00:04:38.790> common<00:04:39.060> sense<00:04:39.360> I

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
you know pretty much common sense I

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.230 
you know pretty much common sense I
basically<00:04:40.110> use<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.380> microfiber<00:04:40.860> cloth<00:04:41.310> and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
basically use a microfiber cloth and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.060 
basically use a microfiber cloth and
just<00:04:42.570> wipe<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.960> down<00:04:43.610> when<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.640> can<00:04:46.070> that's

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
just wipe it down when I can that's

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.280 
just wipe it down when I can that's
basically<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:47.790> there's<00:04:47.970> like<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> mark<00:04:48.570> that

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
basically it if there's like a mark that

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.890 
basically it if there's like a mark that
won't<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:50.250> know<00:04:50.370> come<00:04:51.300> off<00:04:51.480> with<00:04:51.870> a

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
won't you know come off with a

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.330 
won't you know come off with a
microfiber<00:04:52.230> cloth<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.890> know<00:04:52.980> just<00:04:53.190> use<00:04:53.310> a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
microfiber cloth you know just use a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.330 
microfiber cloth you know just use a
slightly<00:04:53.910> damp<00:04:54.350> thicker<00:04:55.350> cloth<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.100> rub

slightly damp thicker cloth and just rub

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.270 
slightly damp thicker cloth and just rub
it<00:04:56.370> out<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.180> should<00:04:57.420> be<00:04:57.570> fine<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:59.100> that's
