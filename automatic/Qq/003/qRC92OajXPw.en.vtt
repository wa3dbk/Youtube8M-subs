00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.189
 it is a bit different now 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.960
 as at the fair is quasi at all 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.929
 nothing at all we are at an angle 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 opposite in a hotel there has become 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 namely capcom made wide and we 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 Journalists are allowed here in this room 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.910
 already the capcom titles allude 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 including dmc devil may cry the reboot 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 the series two years ago was the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.619
 All year announced and there you are 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.420
 that is really still needed 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 looks totally different from totally weird 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 I now have a total of three levels here 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.769
 to play 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 a training level quasi that was already 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.940
 Among other things, I also have known 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 the e3 played in 2012 then there is one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.600
 Enemy fight against some such 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.969
 disgusting crisis level one also with his 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 skills then have to dodge and that 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 just have to send it to where it is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.960
 belongs and there is a gamescom 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 exclusive level where dante in one 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.219
 reverse city is on the way and there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 his abilities with his 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.879
 abilities and I can 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.930
 have to say 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.699
 Gameplaytechnisch I like the whole thing 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 quite well there is a fishing mode and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.730
 a demon mode is the engine mode 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.290
 so a bit the peaceful variation 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.430
 where you become objects and enemies 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.439
 can drag on 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.570
 the demon mode grabs the quasi the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.820
 violent attacks from among others with 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 the sickle and dante swords and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.860
 Of course, the good one has a few 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 guns is really good I have to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 say and the reboot could well 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 succeed wait like the finished one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.670
 Game will look like this makes the whole thing 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.200
 definitely at the gamescom in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200
 quiet atmosphere a good impression 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.130
 OK 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.219
 No 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.219
 like 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.540
 here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.050
 hajo 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.599
 Euro
