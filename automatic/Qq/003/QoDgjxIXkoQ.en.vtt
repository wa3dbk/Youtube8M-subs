00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 and now come back to the next one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.799
 part multiplayer round i have now 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
 The war against the biscuit was carried out 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.940
 Here is the map and not said 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.740
 my first scene was the one 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 to complete provinces 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 I have conquered the province and the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.330
 Complete the rovers on these three 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.439
 cities if you guys better and here 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 I never felt like that at the top and that was yes 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.320
 no big deal 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.670
 There was a big garnison here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.810
 but I could relocate dead there 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.619
 i make the failure we do too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 no big deal 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.779
 and down here Roman government 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.650
 met and now it starts 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 Originally that was so that the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 entire Gallic area and one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 Roman legions have defended 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 Spies said the same is the case 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 cookies started completely unknown to me 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 reason to excavate a second region 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 or bring her 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.730
 I started when I started my open 7 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.469
 is suddenly a legion somehow 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.700
 landed or from africa in east africa 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.530
 come from spain 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 I have the other police working 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 and he already had one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 region two regions okay stop twice 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 as much as expected but would have 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.410
 is still the davis yes that the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 swiss up here for or one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 only province has a huge lead 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.930
 had and the water here in front of charge 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.909
 had landed so is the whole time 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 has destroyed more income that is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.560
 one rather than a region I had three 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.150
 big legion against me just like that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 that has all that bit 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.659
 made it difficult and appropriate 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.220
 There were also many battles and his 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.150
 quite hurt or the whole thing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.920
 to make worse 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.450
 my cavalry when I'm against 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 Separate legionaries let their own 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.229
 Pilot disturbed half of the cavalry 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 well, somehow elite is not mine 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.829
 relatively bad against sword 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 Infantry is very difficult 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.640
 understand so synonymous in the melee 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.200
 and everything and if you're from behind 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.060
 from the side and from the front at the same time 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 Batches the general dead then pull 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.090
 the legionaries are still not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 back because he is fighting until death 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.850
 that is the big advantage of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.399
 cavalry na actually the moral 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 Destroyer is he has apparently 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.140
 Legionnaires almost at all no falls 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.790
 So real catastrophe was the first 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.040
 war days entertaining still running 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 not good I can only just 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.310
 show how it looks so me are so 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.829
 that my entire empire of supplies 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.799
 go down come down arms me all 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.969
 resources if the biscuit maybe times 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.619
 a third of his income 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.450
 I had to invest my frontier too 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.490
 fight the rest spread and no 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.000
 problem for him 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.470
 So I said that lifted 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.300
 Conquered had been relatively easy there 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 there was nothing down here this city got here 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.810
 Obert that he military center 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.640
 there have been gladiators and such 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 So I can also do good troupes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.290
 Let's see if it's this one 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 Round already goes also besieged 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.990
 You never have to stay out of it 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 two round he has lasted since 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.290
 no siege cards longer 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.220
 fails or builds on longer 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.840
 let stand 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.520
 and there I besieged him to death 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.740
 Two rounds was not the world before me 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.350
 a whole legion behind the wall 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.970
 have and fight that most here 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.050
 in the front again a type of the surfaced 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.810
 it starts to germinate 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.160
 Fixed part of 300 million allied 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.210
 you can really show it somehow 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.190
 So the kiggs is doing something 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.120
 just like Oberland's fleet had that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.170
 the other story was out 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.580
 unexplainable reasons of biscuit 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.230
 Of course, up here too a fleet 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.150
 had with nowhere like mine 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.680
 cities here trying to lead then yes 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.140
 bismarckplatz dug around the broken 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.430
 When I get away with it, that comes 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.270
 can also go to higher income 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.010
 was driven broken engraving 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.950
 wanted to allied me on the biscuit 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.660
 I just do not show it at all 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.740
 diplomacy you can see that one puck 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.730
 seldom on it however jesus not 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.400
 insignificant can just me on the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.210
 Click kicks off can I okay to me I 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.530
 I do not know exactly how I do it 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.090
 Can show me allies of the biscuit 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.770
 but in any case are a few 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.810
 I think that works , then I have to 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.400
 the policy is only one round in 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.380
 In every case pretty much everything belongs 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.600
 there's somehow the roman her he 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.560
 is part of the biscuit as ally and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.630
 in all with the war occurred 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.340
 that's why i hold entire known world 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.810
 fight the only thing that helps is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.310
 up here the collar 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.630
 in it to war with the biscuit and 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.670
 now very good relationships to which it 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.460
 means at the moment is war north 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.100
 Here this area felt against this 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.600
 area so runs at the moment completely 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.060
 dangerous individual damage more similar 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.740
 wise, but roughly speaking it is just 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.150
 north against south and south is a bit 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.260
 bigger at the game and also one 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.840
 a bit better developed 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.950
 But so were the first days of war 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.160
 hold like the time with germany 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.110
 also was very successful and france 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.070
 always falls first 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.780
 and now it gets a bit difficult 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.060
 so far then I am 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 have the patricia down here 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.730
 high level operation of them the round 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.200
 one has 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.340
 he has indicated with liked it 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.450
 I think I'm very nice if 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 du ri simply taken over the affairs 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.370
 may be here that is just two agents 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.200
 I'm getting the third one for this 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.640
 where can you work with them ? 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.030
 distribute happiness and others 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.770
 stuff 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.330
 then I'm down here after 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.300
 Marseille means the city I believe 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.040
 exactly mattila or something like that I have one 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.180
 spy to see what's going on here 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.460
 because that's actually the next one 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.170
 city where much income is and where we are 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.700
 we were there troops from irrelevant 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.230
 they also landed a region 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.030
 I think that was the region in 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.760
 africa which summary he uses 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.080
 always to keep track 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.520
 although if that comes from africa so completely 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.290
 without question are only the fresh 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.120
 was dug that no wore with 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.640
 Experience with I think more that the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.020
 From Rome always comes from Italy as well 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.790
 the ista long is also on the way 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.800
 always landed somewhere upstairs 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.790
 I have now considered that every one of me 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.550
 hinschicken 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.110
 the massive flattening you want 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.820
 but send it down with spies 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.530
 a fresh region is coming 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.090
 and i believe i live in my life 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.500
 that region down there will be finished by 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.940
 daake not ordered back 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.440
 for a spy good and I would have 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.360
 never lost but i know 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.640
 then running upwards maybe i do 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.350
 doing here in the woods one ambush on 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.760
 yes, enough time not me because 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.200
 I have taken over his sales year 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.040
 because she does not have anything up there 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.810
 is going on 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.040
 I think I'll get one here in front of him 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.410
 ambush because he can only 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.520
 come across this road to the north and 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.990
 If I ambush them then hit 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.970
 you have to be able to kill the stronger one 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.800
 namely in the ambush no more camper 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.030
 has so javelin thrower and so what the 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.860
 For example, not just 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.450
 cavalry and infantry storm 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.210
 so we'll do it in front of us 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.190
 second region probably comes from italy and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.270
 the new one we have to look that time 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.070
 with the ambush also do here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.670
 no spies, I think 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.350
 at least 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.660
 and maybe I can help you too 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.640
 ambush so make that very nice 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.950
 So I'm already the biscuit 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.360
 i believe two regions plus 3 fat ones 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.620
 garnisons broken and themselves 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.960
 actually only a few troops lost 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.370
 and yet more and more and more come 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.530
 more of an income is due because 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.330
 behind me everything in bradenton swiss 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.670
 just one of my income frets 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.160
 I do not know how the war long term 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.890
 It can win in the stars 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.780
 written
