00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 Well 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 U 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.950
 Oh this time we have to learn the basics 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 I tried to talk about patterns in practice patterns. 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 There are now a total of 8 different steel stroke patterns, 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:30.740
 There are 10 zero packing pattern exercises 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:34.660
 So let's start by learning the eight steel stroke patterns first. 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.660
 The first pattern , 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.330
 OMG 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.940
 Now each steel bit of those first bits is entered 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.940
 And in the case of the second pattern of the second light 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.280
 When you touch the second, you have to twist the river now. In the third case 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.980
 If the price of the third place, the beach is simyeon fourth case ah 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.200
 U 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 Ah 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.460
 In the fifth case after that, I went under 1, 6, 11, 16, 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.080
 You can twist it. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.080
 When it actually exists, 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.210
 Then in the sixth pattern has edaga General and then 13 times 7 times if the light 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.210
 For now, please be so ah gange 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 The seventh pattern is if the fifth of Bayer's third light is a computer 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.850
 I will go in. 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.910
 So Ah 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.220
 And in the last eighth pattern, 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.700
 Four, seven, ten, ten and three of the beaches now come in. 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.930
 It's possible 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.930
 When you hear the real thing . 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.930
 U 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.930
 It will produce food 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.810
 So now I think about the ten zigzag king m, 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.670
 I will have the following idea 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.670
 The ninth pattern is that of yo 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.640
 Members are the 10th pattern is ah 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150
 Ah 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.090
 The pants pattern is 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 The address pattern is 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.380
 U 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380
 U 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.920
 4 Ha ha ha 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.420
 U 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.700
 4 to 5 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220
 U 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.260
 The 8th pattern is 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:56.170
 4 When you first learn it, you will have difficulty in a difficult mountain. Yes Strokes 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.400
 La said it's easy to pin it exactly to the pt's wanted pattern 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.410
 I did not. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:07.120
 If you like modern, air-stroke There is something in the book that defined four strokes 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 But there are a lot of things that change depending on the situation, 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.610
 Uh back hard even though there are some things I want through these news 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.620
 Place these exercises to support the compact zero pitching to the desired bit 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.370
 I think it is necessary. 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:27.390
 In any case , no matter what belief it is, 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.390
 If you are a scrap from cancer , think Art Gear as a mosque
