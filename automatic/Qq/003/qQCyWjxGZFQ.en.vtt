was<00:00:27.300> something<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.460> enjoyed<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
was something that I really enjoyed and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.179 
was something that I really enjoyed and

it<00:00:32.309> wasn't<00:00:32.880> something<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.620> chose<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> do

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it wasn't something that I chose to do

it wasn't something that I chose to do
on<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> commercial<00:00:35.250> footing<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.149> love

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
on a commercial footing but I just love

example aluminium will work hard the
more<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.550> work<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.480> knowing<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:54.780> far<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
more you work it so knowing how far you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.950 
more you work it so knowing how far you
can<00:01:55.650> push<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:57.120> know<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> hammering<00:01:57.720> or<00:01:57.870> the

can push you know the hammering or the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
can push you know the hammering or the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.150 
starts to tear is is is really important
there's<00:02:03.870> really<00:02:04.050> only<00:02:04.170> two<00:02:04.380> shapes<00:02:04.830> and

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
there's really only two shapes and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.390 
there's really only two shapes and
there's<00:02:05.310> better<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.970> convex<00:02:06.330> or<00:02:06.510> concave<00:02:07.400> and

the variations are a thousandfold and
even<00:02:10.230> if<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.410> look<00:02:10.530> at<00:02:10.649> something<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.070> complex

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
even if you look at something as complex

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.100 
even if you look at something as complex
as<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.850> human<00:02:11.940> face<00:02:12.330> there's<00:02:12.570> only<00:02:12.690> those<00:02:12.900> two

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
as a human face there's only those two

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.710 
as a human face there's only those two
shapes<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:14.130> once<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.460> understand<00:02:15.060> what<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
shapes but once you understand what the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.030 
shapes but once you understand what the
material<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.200> doing<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.800> can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
material is doing and how you can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.430 
material is doing and how you can
stretch<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> how<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.820> work<00:02:18.150> it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
stretch it and how you can work it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.810 
stretch it and how you can work it
there's<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.830> nothing<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.460> can't

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
there's really nothing that you can't

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.380 
there's really nothing that you can't
make
