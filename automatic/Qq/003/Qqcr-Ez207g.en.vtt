right now so you really only need to get

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.929 
right now so you really only need to get
a<00:01:40.210> gentle<00:01:40.569> bounce<00:01:40.899> on<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.289> eggs<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:42.640> enough

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
a gentle bounce on the eggs just enough

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.380 
a gentle bounce on the eggs just enough
to<00:01:43.060> keep<00:01:43.210> them<00:01:43.390> moving<00:01:43.569> around<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:44.020> little<00:01:44.109> bit

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to keep them moving around a little bit

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.929 
to keep them moving around a little bit
and<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.350> mentioned<00:01:47.799> before<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.549> really

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
and like I mentioned before it is really

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.179 
and like I mentioned before it is really
helpful<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.929> have<00:01:50.079> these<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:51.009> valves

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
helpful to have these little valves

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.550 
helpful to have these little valves
hooked<00:01:51.819> up<00:01:51.969> to<00:01:52.090> your<00:01:52.119> tumbler<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:53.350> way<00:01:53.500> you

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
hooked up to your tumbler that way you

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830 
hooked up to your tumbler that way you
can<00:01:53.860> adjust<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.310> air<00:01:54.429> flow<00:01:54.459> on<00:01:55.090> each<00:01:55.359> tumbler

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
can adjust the air flow on each tumbler

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.709 
can adjust the air flow on each tumbler
individually<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:01.119> just<00:02:01.329> have<00:02:01.509> these

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
individually and I just have these

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.559 
individually and I just have these
running<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.740> little<00:02:03.490> top<00:02:03.700> fin<00:02:04.030> air<00:02:04.299> pump

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
running on a little top fin air pump

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.880 
running on a little top fin air pump
with<00:02:05.439> four<00:02:05.739> outputs<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:08.049> hook<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.440> four

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
with four outputs so I can hook up four

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.930 
with four outputs so I can hook up four
tumblers<00:02:09.340> at<00:02:09.519> one<00:02:09.670> time<00:02:11.579> that's<00:02:12.579> a<00:02:12.730> pretty

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
tumblers at one time that's a pretty

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:29.309 
tumblers at one time that's a pretty
decent<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.480> setup

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.140 

so<00:02:29.860> that's<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.189> a<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.459> gonna<00:02:30.670> wrap<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:31.060> up

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
so that's just a bit gonna wrap it up

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.569 
so that's just a bit gonna wrap it up
for<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.450> video<00:02:31.689> I<00:02:31.959> hope<00:02:32.799> this<00:02:33.069> helped<00:02:33.370> anybody
