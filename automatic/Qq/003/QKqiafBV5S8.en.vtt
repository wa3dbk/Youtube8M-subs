like<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.290> remove<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.830> can<00:02:05.979> see<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:08.170> gonna

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
like that remove you can see it's gonna

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.139 
like that remove you can see it's gonna
be<00:02:08.500> down<00:02:08.709> in<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> front<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.399> up<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.970> back

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
be down in the front and up in the back

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.660 
be down in the front and up in the back
towards<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.720> home

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
towards the home

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.100 
towards the home
so<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:12.880> kind<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.150> slips<00:02:13.450> over<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.020> it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so it just kind of slips over it and it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.770 
so it just kind of slips over it and it
rolls<00:02:14.380> as<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.040> goes<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.330> locks<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
rolls as it goes on and and it locks it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.810 
rolls as it goes on and and it locks it
into<00:02:17.220> into<00:02:18.220> position<00:02:18.959> anyway<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.730> put<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
into into position anyway I put the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.800 
into into position anyway I put the
student<00:02:22.120> went<00:02:22.239> back<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:24.420> no<00:02:25.420> more<00:02:25.569> squeak
