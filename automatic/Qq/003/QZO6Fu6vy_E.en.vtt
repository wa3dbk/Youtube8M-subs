creative server you see we are

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.950 
creative server you see we are
developing<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.910> building<00:00:21.090> tons<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.720> stuff

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960

snapshot and well yeah at first

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.190 
snapshot and well yeah at first
multiplayer<00:00:29.220> elevators<00:00:29.850> are<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.539> fixed<00:00:30.870> so

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
multiplayer elevators are now fixed so

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
multiplayer elevators are now fixed so
here<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.039> have<00:00:34.340> 10<00:00:35.340> meters<00:00:35.699> per<00:00:35.820> second

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here we have 10 meters per second

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.360 
here we have 10 meters per second
elevator<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.440> working<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.010> great

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
elevator and it's working really great

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.260 
elevator and it's working really great
and<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.780> design<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.760> adapted<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.120> bit

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and this design here I adapted it a bit

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
and this design here I adapted it a bit
so<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.170> fail<00:00:43.530> proof<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.950> even

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so that it's actually fail proof so even

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
so that it's actually fail proof so even
if<00:00:44.370> I've<00:00:44.489> tried<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> site<00:00:45.540> here

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
if I've tried to get to the site here

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.670 
if I've tried to get to the site here
and<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:47.520> will<00:00:47.730> always<00:00:48.720> be<00:00:49.079> pushed<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and we will always be pushed into the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
and we will always be pushed into the
middle<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.489> iron<00:00:51.030> mask<00:00:51.329> hit<00:00:51.750> me

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
middle because the iron mask hit me

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
middle because the iron mask hit me
there<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> behind<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> desk<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> basic

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
there and behind the desk the basic

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
there and behind the desk the basic
wiring<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.739> tons<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
wiring and so there are tons of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
wiring and so there are tons of
tutorials<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.329> elevators<00:00:57.719> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
tutorials about these elevators so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
tutorials about these elevators so
that's<00:00:58.469> wasn't<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> wanted<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.790> show<00:00:59.880> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
but actually I got a lot better design

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.789 
but actually I got a lot better design
than<00:01:02.880> this<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.079> it's<00:01:04.259> also<00:01:04.439> working

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
than this so you see it's also working

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.660 
than this so you see it's also working
for<00:01:04.920> poets<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.950> that's<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> wanted<00:01:08.610> to

if so let's do a little oh yeah
this<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.790> little<00:02:24.420> battle<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.740> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this is a little battle here and this is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.040 
this is a little battle here and this is
not<00:02:26.040> finished<00:02:26.850> yet<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.120> could<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.600> totally

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
not finished yet we could we totally

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.770 
not finished yet we could we totally
enclosed<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.120> can't<00:02:30.330> fail<00:02:30.570> when

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
enclosed it so that you can't fail when

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.290 
enclosed it so that you can't fail when
trying<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.200> get<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.830> again<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> most

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
trying to get down again but the most

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300 
trying to get down again but the most
interesting<00:02:33.750> part<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.320> obviously<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.160> up

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
interesting part is obviously to get up

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.370 
interesting part is obviously to get up
so<00:02:35.670> let<00:02:35.880> me<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.209> somewhere<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> pulse

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
so let me get somewhere in the pulse

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.550 
so let me get somewhere in the pulse
here<00:02:37.700> okay<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:38.760> Thomas<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> trying<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.170> get<00:02:40.320> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
here okay so Thomas is trying to get to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.890 
here okay so Thomas is trying to get to
the<00:02:40.650> top<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> same<00:02:41.250> time<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.760> am<00:02:41.900> so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the top at the same time as I am so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:03:03.979 
the top at the same time as I am so
three<00:02:43.260> two<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.920> go<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:02.150> every<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.750> see

a bit of damage but actually i'm only

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.680 
a bit of damage but actually i'm only
using<00:03:13.290> fellow<00:03:13.709> falling<00:03:14.100> for<00:03:14.340> votes<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:15.300> you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
using fellow falling for votes so you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
using fellow falling for votes so you
don't<00:03:15.930> need<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.500> protection<00:03:16.739> or<00:03:17.190> anything

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
don't need for protection or anything

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.550 
don't need for protection or anything
you<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:17.850> need<00:03:18.390> feather<00:03:18.660> falling<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.380> I

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you just need feather falling for and I

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.170 
you just need feather falling for and I
a<00:03:19.860> mean<00:03:20.070> even<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.580> don't<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:20.880> any

a mean even if you don't have any

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.030 
a mean even if you don't have any
further<00:03:21.330> fall<00:03:21.540> boots<00:03:21.750> you've<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.200> wait<00:03:22.500> till

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
further fall boots you've just wait till

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370 
further fall boots you've just wait till
you<00:03:23.070> throw<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> nfl's<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.230> can

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
you throw the nfl's so and here you can

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.800 
you throw the nfl's so and here you can
see<00:03:25.440> how<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.890> working<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.730> simple<00:03:27.030> you

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
see how it's working it's so simple you

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.039 
see how it's working it's so simple you
just<00:03:27.840> got<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:29.370> tool<00:03:29.820> let<00:03:30.420> me<00:03:30.540> get<00:03:30.720> go<00:03:30.989> to

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
just got this tool let me get go to

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.470 
just got this tool let me get go to
creative<00:03:31.560> here<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.880> read<00:03:33.060> some<00:03:33.269> wires

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
creative here it is to read some wires

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.840 
creative here it is to read some wires
on<00:03:33.690> top<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.140> trip<00:03:34.350> wire<00:03:34.500> hooks<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
on top of the trip wire hooks and the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.759 
on top of the trip wire hooks and the
trapdoors<00:03:36.299> updating<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.019> bat<00:03:37.170> pieces<00:03:37.620> here

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
trapdoors updating the bat pieces here

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.500 
trapdoors updating the bat pieces here
directly<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:38.549> don't<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.000> make

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
directly so that they don't have to make

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.900 
directly so that they don't have to make
any<00:03:39.750> further<00:03:40.230> wiring<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:41.040> super<00:03:41.519> compact

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
any further wiring so it's super compact

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600 
any further wiring so it's super compact
super<00:03:42.269> easy<00:03:42.450> they<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.350> trigger<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
super easy they just trigger it so and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.960 
super easy they just trigger it so and
even<00:03:45.090> end<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.630> Hell<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:46.049> yeah<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.310> basically

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
even end of Hell in yeah it's basically

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.670 
even end of Hell in yeah it's basically
an<00:03:48.150> end<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.360> hell<00:03:48.510> pearl<00:03:48.870> hits<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.440> tread

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
an end the hell pearl hits the tread

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.430 
an end the hell pearl hits the tread
tripwire<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.850> when<00:03:51.030> you're<00:03:51.150> throwing<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:52.260> up

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
tripwire so when you're throwing one up

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.120 
tripwire so when you're throwing one up
and<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:54.780> will<00:03:54.900> throw<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.950> against<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:58.130> trip

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
and you will throw it against the trip

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.009 
and you will throw it against the trip
wire<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.880> bottom<00:04:00.180> closes<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.840> can

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
wire and the bottom closes so you can

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.410 
wire and the bottom closes so you can
stand<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:01.560> here<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.070> either<00:04:02.310> go<00:04:02.670> out<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.239> we

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
stand in here and either go out so we

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.050 
stand in here and either go out so we
got<00:04:03.570> several<00:04:03.930> flaws<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.310> each<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.730> spaced

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
got several flaws here so each is spaced

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.810 
got several flaws here so each is spaced
out<00:04:06.239> by<00:04:06.450> 20<00:04:06.840> meters<00:04:07.200> or<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:08.130> want<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.700> go

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
out by 20 meters or if you want to go

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.060 
out by 20 meters or if you want to go
straight<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.660> throw<00:04:09.930> another<00:04:10.170> one<00:04:10.320> it's

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
straight up just throw another one it's

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.069 
straight up just throw another one it's
super<00:04:11.459> simple<00:04:11.610> if<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.090> somehow<00:04:12.390> should<00:04:12.810> fail

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
super simple if you somehow should fail

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.259 
super simple if you somehow should fail
I<00:04:13.320> mean<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:13.799> is<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> little<00:04:14.549> small

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
I mean there is a little small

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.819 
I mean there is a little small
possibility<00:04:15.510> when<00:04:16.229> there's<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.530> lot<00:04:16.799> of

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
possibility when there's a lot of

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.349 
possibility when there's a lot of
multiplayer<00:04:17.310> like<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.790> will<00:04:17.940> fail<00:04:18.180> but

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
multiplayer like that you will fail but

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.890 
multiplayer like that you will fail but
then<00:04:18.600> just<00:04:19.019> descends<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.250> we<00:04:20.400> fall<00:04:20.640> back<00:04:21.419> which

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
then just descends so we fall back which

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.240 
then just descends so we fall back which
is<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.140> bit<00:04:22.320> annoying<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:22.680> there<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.100> water

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
is a bit annoying but there is a water

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.570 
is a bit annoying but there is a water
break<00:04:23.520> here<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.970> won't<00:04:24.240> die<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.580> the

lack reasons to get stuck in a blog just

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.540 
lack reasons to get stuck in a blog just
throw<00:04:31.349> another<00:04:31.590> pearl<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.099> ground<00:04:32.310> and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
throw another pearl on the ground and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.170 
throw another pearl on the ground and
you<00:04:32.789> pick

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
you pick

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.300 
you pick
and<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.449> can<00:04:33.660> get<00:04:33.780> up<00:04:33.930> again<00:04:34.199> so<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.770> in

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
and you can get up again so and in

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
single player this is absolutely working

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.100 
single player this is absolutely working
without<00:04:37.530> any<00:04:37.949> problems<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.300> think<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.840> don't

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
without any problems and I think I don't

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.580 
without any problems and I think I don't
even<00:04:40.380> have<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:41.070> rebuild<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:43.050> so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
even have to rebuild this so it's so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.340 
even have to rebuild this so it's so
simple<00:04:43.889> just<00:04:44.039> build<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.639> 2<00:04:44.789> by<00:04:44.940> 2<00:04:44.970> cube<00:04:45.449> place

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
simple just build a 2 by 2 cube place

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.540 
simple just build a 2 by 2 cube place
pistons<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:48.110> trapdoors<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.530> trip<00:04:50.160> wire<00:04:50.310> like

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
pistons and trapdoors and trip wire like

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.909 
pistons and trapdoors and trip wire like
this<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.000> any<00:04:51.389> solid<00:04:51.750> block<00:04:51.930> where<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.410> red

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
this and any solid block where the red

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.680 
this and any solid block where the red
stone<00:04:53.100> can<00:04:53.280> be<00:04:53.310> on<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.000> glowstone<00:04:54.570> is

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
stone can be on so the glowstone is

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.210 
stone can be on so the glowstone is
obviously<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.169> necessary<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.860> just<00:04:56.100> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
obviously not necessary it's just the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.810 
obviously not necessary it's just the
design<00:04:56.490> aspect<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.060> this<00:04:58.250> half<00:04:59.250> slips<00:04:59.639> here

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
design aspect and this half slips here

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.909 
design aspect and this half slips here
just<00:05:00.090> make<00:05:00.300> sure<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.960> will<00:05:01.080> never<00:05:01.380> lift

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
just make sure that you will never lift

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.670 
just make sure that you will never lift
through<00:05:02.280> lawyer<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:03.199> normally<00:05:04.199> also<00:05:04.530> goes

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
through lawyer so I normally also goes

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.570 
through lawyer so I normally also goes
without<00:05:04.860> but<00:05:05.430> sometimes<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.210> else<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:07.580> yeah

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
without but sometimes this else so yeah

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.990 
without but sometimes this else so yeah
this<00:05:08.729> was<00:05:08.940> just<00:05:09.210> an<00:05:09.330> example<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:12.210> who<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.539> are

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
this was just an example so who you are

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.170 
this was just an example so who you are
so<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.750> saying<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.889> see<00:05:17.130> most<00:05:17.580> times<00:05:17.940> is

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
so just saying you see most times is

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.330 
so just saying you see most times is
working<00:05:18.539> but<00:05:19.380> sometimes<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.009> bleach<00:05:20.190> it

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
working but sometimes you bleach it

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.680 
working but sometimes you bleach it
through<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.759> addressed<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.389> it's

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
through like addressed it and it's

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.540 
through like addressed it and it's
easily<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.289> fixed<00:05:22.410> by<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:22.800> using<00:05:22.949> harsh<00:05:23.310> lips

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
easily be fixed by just using harsh lips

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.760 
easily be fixed by just using harsh lips
because<00:05:23.910> then<00:05:24.210> actually<00:05:24.900> have<00:05:25.020> some<00:05:25.259> time<00:05:25.530> to

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
because then actually have some time to

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.320 
because then actually have some time to
in<00:05:26.460> fall<00:05:26.699> down<00:05:27.169> okay<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.639> yeah<00:05:29.639> this<00:05:30.120> is

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
in fall down okay and yeah this is

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.240 
in fall down okay and yeah this is
basically<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.870> whole<00:05:31.050> thing<00:05:31.349> just<00:05:31.800> wanted<00:05:32.160> to

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
basically the whole thing just wanted to

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.060 
basically the whole thing just wanted to
show<00:05:32.430> this<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.789> as<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> little<00:05:33.330> update<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:34.070> I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
show this you as a little update and I

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.820 
show this you as a little update and I
hope<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.520> enjoy<00:05:35.820> it<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.289> yeah<00:05:37.289> this<00:05:37.440> is<00:05:37.620> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
hope you enjoy it and yeah this is I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.060 
hope you enjoy it and yeah this is I
think<00:05:37.979> this<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.639> l<00:05:39.500> faster<00:05:40.500> than<00:05:40.650> even<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
think this is l faster than even the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.540 
think this is l faster than even the
other<00:05:41.220> elevator<00:05:41.639> so<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:42.120> guess<00:05:43.039> so<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.340> can

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
other elevator so I guess so you can

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.969 
other elevator so I guess so you can
nearly<00:05:45.150> keep<00:05:45.449> up<00:05:45.630> when<00:05:45.840> flying<00:05:46.229> with<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:46.770> one

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
nearly keep up when flying with this one

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.710 
nearly keep up when flying with this one
but<00:05:47.159> this<00:05:47.460> year<00:05:47.699> is<00:05:47.849> even<00:05:48.150> faster<00:05:48.270> so<00:05:48.570> it's

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
but this year is even faster so it's

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.469 
but this year is even faster so it's
somewhat<00:05:49.590> between<00:05:49.800> 11<00:05:50.430> meters<00:05:50.760> per<00:05:50.940> block<00:05:51.000> it

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
somewhat between 11 meters per block it

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.330 
somewhat between 11 meters per block it
actually<00:05:51.960> depends<00:05:52.289> on<00:05:52.470> how<00:05:52.620> much<00:05:52.830> you<00:05:53.070> space

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
actually depends on how much you space

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.830 
actually depends on how much you space
out<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.699> different<00:05:54.000> floors<00:05:54.240> if<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:54.539> put<00:05:54.720> them

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
out the different floors if you put them

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.540 
out the different floors if you put them
a<00:05:54.930> little<00:05:55.229> bit<00:05:55.409> closer<00:05:55.650> together<00:05:55.919> it's<00:05:56.250> even

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
a little bit closer together it's even

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.879 
a little bit closer together it's even
faster<00:05:56.729> cause<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.870> ender<00:05:58.080> pearl<00:05:58.260> slows<00:05:58.590> down

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
faster cause the ender pearl slows down

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.399 
faster cause the ender pearl slows down
just<00:05:59.610> shortly<00:06:00.330> before<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:00.750> reach<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.050> finish

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
just shortly before you reach the finish

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.040 
just shortly before you reach the finish
but<00:06:01.770> if<00:06:02.159> you<00:06:02.550> put<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:02.849> closer<00:06:03.539> together<00:06:03.720> you

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
but if you put it closer together you

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.320 
but if you put it closer together you
obviously<00:06:04.380> need<00:06:04.620> more<00:06:04.889> nfl's<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.699> also<00:06:06.090> take

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
obviously need more nfl's and also take

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.290 
obviously need more nfl's and also take
more<00:06:06.539> damage<00:06:06.720> when<00:06:07.169> going<00:06:07.560> up<00:06:07.710> so<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.699> think<00:06:08.789> 20

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
more damage when going up so I think 20

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.909 
more damage when going up so I think 20
meters<00:06:09.570> is<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.720> good<00:06:10.820> well<00:06:12.470> yeah<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.680> is<00:06:13.830> pretty

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
meters is a good well yeah it is pretty

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.860 
meters is a good well yeah it is pretty
good<00:06:14.220> because<00:06:14.460> yeah<00:06:15.210> at<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.389> same<00:06:15.570> time<00:06:15.720> you

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
good because yeah at the same time you

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.629 
good because yeah at the same time you
go<00:06:16.020> up<00:06:16.050> pretty<00:06:16.530> cool<00:06:16.710> pretty<00:06:16.919> far<00:06:17.250> with<00:06:17.400> one

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
go up pretty cool pretty far with one

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.999 
go up pretty cool pretty far with one
throw<00:06:17.940> and<00:06:17.970> also<00:06:18.690> it<00:06:19.020> doesn't<00:06:19.259> slow<00:06:19.560> down<00:06:19.590> too

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
throw and also it doesn't slow down too
