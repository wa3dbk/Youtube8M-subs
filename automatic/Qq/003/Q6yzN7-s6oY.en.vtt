00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.100 
the one who seems the most powerful and
I<00:03:09.750> think<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.500> guy<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.710> making<00:03:11.580> really

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
I think that if a guy is making really

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.930 
I think that if a guy is making really
big<00:03:13.110> motions<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.920> his<00:03:14.040> body<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.490> means

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
big motions with his body that means

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.460 
big motions with his body that means
he's<00:03:15.150> confident<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.900> turned<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.230> by<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
he's confident you get turned on by that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
he's confident you get turned on by that
now<00:03:17.010> what<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> big<00:03:17.550> much<00:03:17.700> now<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.209> could<00:03:18.390> be

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
now what the big much now it could be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.740 
now what the big much now it could be
really<00:03:18.750> difficult<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.530> uh<00:03:20.450> determine<00:03:21.450> what

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
