00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the important thing for me is to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
the important thing for me is to
remember<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.109> MMA<00:00:31.410> fighter<00:00:31.679> he's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279

coming<00:00:32.579> into<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:32.940> world<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
coming into my world and you know the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130
