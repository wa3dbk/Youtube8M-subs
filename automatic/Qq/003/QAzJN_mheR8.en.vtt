 we have the galaxy s 4 we have the new 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 blackberry z10 and we want to make a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.820
 analysis for you to know when

 of buying a smartphone which 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910
 It is the best but we will see on screen 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.570
 the characteristics for example of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 iphone 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.020
 some more features 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.969
 relevant a new design a screen 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.039
 very much thinner therefore it is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.470
 lighter the computer has a screen 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.710
 of retina display of high resolution 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.150
 this allows us to watch and record videos by 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 your camera a lot of 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.110
 megapixels has also a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.480
 Comprehensive functionality with maps 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.880
 on the subject of global positioning a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.399
 super fast wireless connection 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.290
 multimedia playback with your new 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 processor a duration capacity of 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.950
 the 8-hour battery this equipment will 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
 characterized by its design of 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.030
 software or operating system is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.649
 really functional in terms of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 that is, the system is made 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.549
 operative of the iphone for the team to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.740
 difference from other operating systems 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.320
 let's go again for example to see 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.270
 the galaxy s 4 what are the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 relevant characteristics of the galaxy in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 this summary that we want to present to you 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.380
 you sensor of light and movement 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.509
 when you move your view of the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 The computer screen is paused if 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.659
 you are seeing something if you take a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 Photograph that can eliminate people 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.590
 Do not want objects to come out that do not 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 you are interested in the photography with 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 just move it with your finger in a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 series of sensors even for 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.119
 Health applications are 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.360
 important characteristics of the new 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.580
 galaxy s 4 this is from the samsung brand and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.890
 in the case of the blackberry z10 the most 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.709
 recent version of the company 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.549
 blackberry that launched your z10 to you 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.649
 You can see some of their 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.020
 features such to me 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 impressed the subject of photography 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.130
 you can take a picture that is 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 record a small video clip and you 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 can take the moment that most 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.130
 favors but let's compare it let's 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.619
 see a comparative table that we have 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.140
 drawn up in this techno click delivery 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.450
 for you where we have the screen 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.150
 in each of the cases in the galaxy 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.819
 blackberry iphone the galaxy is the one 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.159
 has the largest screen of 5 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.980
 in the case of iphone blackberry is a lot 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:25.370
 smaller one of 4.2 another of 4 the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.450
 resolution in the case of galaxy s 4 is 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.950
 a higher resolution 1920 megapixels 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.040
 x 1080 in the case of the z10 only 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.590
 1220 say that the resolution of the galaxy 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.319
 s 4 superior the type of screen in the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.239
 Galaxy case is super amoled is a 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.939
 Higher quality screen 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.849
 reproduction in the case of the z10 is a 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.370
 the lic and crystals display that is lcd 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.739
 a liquid crystal display and in the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.719
 iphone 5 case one of retina like 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.219
 we had said if you look and see 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.590
 the other memory features 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.260
 internal have more capacity options 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.579
 in that 4 operating system in the case 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.659
 of the operating system iphone is a 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.299
 operating system 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.849
 really developed for the team the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.370
 battery is of longer duration in the case 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.469
 of the galaxy two cameras and you what 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.540
 can see the capacity of the cameras 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.669
 the megapixels refer to how 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.340
 good is the image we can capture 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.840
 both video and photography 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.840
 activity all types of 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.730
 memory connectivity basically in the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 memory case the iphone 5 has 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.780
 advantages and wireless charging the only 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.940
 which has the possibility of loading 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.340
 wireless is the 4 s is to say that by 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.370
 characteristics or fitur we have to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.769
 recognize that the galaxy s 4 is the team 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.959
 more complete in terms of features 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.690
 This is also because the iPhone still 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.209
 has not released its new version each 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.519
 has its strengths and weaknesses in the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.680
 case for example the iphone is a computer 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.360
 extraordinary for multimedia for 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.880
 listen to music to surf the web 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.170
 the z10 has made great efforts but 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.120
 has remained in the case of 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.769
 blackberry a little bit behind these are 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.019
 the three most well-known teams 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.730
 most popular in the country and if 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.640
 we have to say a ranking in first 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.010
 place is the galaxy s 4 in second 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.410
 place would be iphone and in a third 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.430
 place would be blackberry without mentioning 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.430
 other equipment like
