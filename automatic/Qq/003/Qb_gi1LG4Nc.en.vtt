00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.549
 mortal kombat 10 if we do not stop 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.680
 talk about this title of the genre of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 fight that will certainly mark a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.299
 before and after I'm sure of it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 warner bros has confirmed that deadly 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.560
 kombat 10 is going to have a series of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 easy fatalities for all those 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 people and players who have 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.769
 difficulties in introducing the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.590
 different commands needed to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.900
 realize them you already know that the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.449
 called good formerly called 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.660
 combos to perform different attacks 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.120
 they were made with a combination of 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 crosshead buttons etc. and so on 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 quite complicated in some cases 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 well, as commented by the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
 company on this occasion in mortal 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.770
 kombat 10 we will have access to can that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.440
 three of those combos from the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.699
 first day although we can unlock 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 some more fulfilling a series of 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.559
 requirements a series of fatalities 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 easy accessible to everyone 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.510
 mortal kombat 10 the truth is that it offers 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 this possibility because as I say for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 draw the attention of those players 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.720
 that are not so formal and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.720
 familiar with the control of one 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 the comeback not maybe this pisses off many 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 users especially to purists of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 saga because it's true that it's unfair that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.370
 a person who happens the fact of 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 practice so that the 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.920
 combos get them done but another 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 user that with only giving a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 button with those easy pieces of paper what 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.910
 get as you see the subject of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 the easy fatalities do you think this 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.050
 it should have been introduced or 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 He would have obviated must 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.580
 clarify of course that it is a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.170
 series of easy fatalities that are not 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.690
 because they do not have to be the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.580
 complicated is logically a 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.210
 user who gets a great combination 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.590
 he will be the only one who can do 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.420
 certain attacks but good what 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 true is that mortal kombat is already 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 giving a lot to talk about, you know the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.900

 that each character is going to have three 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 different combat styles and it's going to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.430
