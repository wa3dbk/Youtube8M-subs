00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.919 
episode 8 and the episode starts off
with<00:00:07.500> Liz<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:08.069> finally<00:00:08.460> back<00:00:08.610> home<00:00:08.670> but<00:00:09.660> they

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
with Liz is finally back home but they

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.350 
with Liz is finally back home but they
won't<00:00:10.139> let<00:00:10.290> her<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.679> because<00:00:11.429> apparently<00:00:12.210> her

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
won't let her in because apparently her

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.910 
won't let her in because apparently her
brother<00:00:12.599> Joe<00:00:12.900> told<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:14.780> police<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> guess<00:00:15.990> that

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
brother Joe told the police I guess that

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980 
brother Joe told the police I guess that
she<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:17.730> not<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.850> returning<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.449> some<00:00:18.750> time

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
she would not be returning for some time

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.769 
she would not be returning for some time
now<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.910> police<00:00:21.210> woman<00:00:21.539> which

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
now but they have the police woman which

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
now but they have the police woman which
is<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.199> there's<00:00:22.619> chief<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.310> believe<00:00:23.820> her<00:00:24.000> name

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is like there's chief I believe her name

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.750 
is like there's chief I believe her name
was<00:00:24.210> barrows<00:00:24.930> something<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> she

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
was barrows something like that she

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.830 
was barrows something like that she
allows<00:00:27.150> Liz

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
allows Liz

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.529 
allows Liz
two<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.769> enter<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:30.210> she

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
two would like to enter because she

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.650 
two would like to enter because she

wants to arrest brass because he left

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660 
wants to arrest brass because he left

without permission and so he's in

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.860 
without permission and so he's in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
they are arrested like like they they a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
they are arrested like like they they a
show<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> yet<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.850> last<00:01:00.030> episode<00:01:00.149> they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
show and yet in last episode they

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
show and yet in last episode they
actually<00:01:01.379> were<00:01:02.219> Brian<00:01:02.609> actually<00:01:02.969> working

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
actually were Brian actually working

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
actually were Brian actually working
with<00:01:03.960> Frank<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.439> guessing<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.250> Kim<00:01:05.580> as

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
with Frank I'm guessing to make a Kim as

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
with Frank I'm guessing to make a Kim as
strong<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.600> possible<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.680> he<00:01:07.710> could<00:01:08.010> take

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
strong as possible so that he could take

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
strong as possible so that he could take
on<00:01:08.340> status<00:01:08.670> again<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.470> brad

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
on status again because we all know brad

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.700 
on status again because we all know brad
has<00:01:10.979> definitely<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.030> cannot<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.450> trusted<00:01:12.710> like

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
has definitely it cannot be trusted like

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.350 
has definitely it cannot be trusted like
just<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> way<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.700> acting<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.150> last

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
just the way he was acting in last

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
just the way he was acting in last
episode<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.080> gave<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> away<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
episode kind of gave it away so I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
episode kind of gave it away so I
believe<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.939> he<00:01:18.119> wants<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> chemist

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
believe that he wants to make a chemist

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.130 
believe that he wants to make a chemist
wrong<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.320> possible<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> he<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
wrong as possible so that he can be a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.719 
wrong as possible so that he can be a
worthy<00:01:22.140> challenge<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:22.920> against<00:01:23.250> ash<00:01:23.400> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
worthy challenge to go against ash so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
worthy challenge to go against ash so
that<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.900> its<00:01:25.650> full

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that we can really see its full

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
that we can really see its full
potential<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.850> were<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
potential but that were there to what I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
potential but that were there to what I
think<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.350> staff<00:01:29.040> did<00:01:29.400> beat<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> carabiner

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
think because staff did beat a carabiner

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
think because staff did beat a carabiner
pretty<00:01:30.600> easily<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.950> Kim<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
pretty easily so right now with Kim is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
pretty easily so right now with Kim is
pretty<00:01:32.460> weak<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.450> believe<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.110> he

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
pretty weak and I believe that he

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.460 
pretty weak and I believe that he
definitely<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> make<00:01:35.070> him<00:01:35.189> stronger<00:01:36.470> but

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
definitely want to make him stronger but

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.890 
definitely want to make him stronger but
then<00:01:37.740> once<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.880> they're<00:01:39.659> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
then once they get there they're like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.679 
then once they get there they're like
brief<00:01:40.470> dialogue<00:01:40.740> between<00:01:41.369> brands<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
brief dialogue between brands and and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
brief dialogue between brands and and
policewoman<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.040> seems<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.549> have

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
policewoman and it seems that they have

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.749 
policewoman and it seems that they have
like<00:01:44.939> some<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> past<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> parent

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like some kind of past but as a parent

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.109 
like some kind of past but as a parent
now<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> Brian<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> pervert<00:01:50.119> Chuck

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
now that a Brian really a pervert Chuck

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.609 
now that a Brian really a pervert Chuck
from<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> way<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> deal<00:01:52.590> with

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
from the way that they will I deal with

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.700 
from the way that they will I deal with
a<00:01:52.740> connecting<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.549> another<00:01:54.530> but<00:01:55.530> of

a connecting to one another but of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889

because they are siblings and apparently

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.180 
because they are siblings and apparently

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
something that you can definitely not

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.490 
something that you can definitely not
estimate<00:05:50.310> because<00:05:51.090> if<00:05:51.389> you<00:05:51.540> do<00:05:51.690> she<00:05:52.050> will<00:05:52.199> mess

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
estimate because if you do she will mess
