00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and I'm excited for what we've been

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.820 
and I'm excited for what we've been
doing<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> lot<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> young

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
doing and I think a lot of the young

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230 
doing and I think a lot of the young
guys<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.130> stepped<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:29.970> moving<00:00:30.179> in

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.820 
guys have stepped up and we're moving in
the<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.420> direction<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> look<00:00:31.619> back

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the right direction when you look back

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
the right direction when you look back
to<00:00:32.009> last<00:00:32.040> year<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.880> learning<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to last year and really learning how to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
to last year and really learning how to
play<00:00:33.630> outside<00:00:34.020> linebacker<00:00:34.410> could<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> have

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
play outside linebacker could you have

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
play outside linebacker could you have
imagined<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.030> year<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> way

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
imagined that the year would go the way

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
imagined that the year would go the way
it<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> kind<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.160> take

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it did that you kind of would just take

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
it did that you kind of would just take
to<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.760> duck<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.120> water

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to it like a duck to water

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
to it like a duck to water
not<00:00:40.020> exactly<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.100> always<00:00:41.399> envision

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
not exactly I know you always envision

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
not exactly I know you always envision
myself<00:00:41.940> having<00:00:42.360> some<00:00:42.540> type<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.809> success<00:00:42.989> but

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
myself having some type of success but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
myself having some type of success but
not<00:00:43.980> necessarily<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> type<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> success<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
not necessarily the type of success I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.170 
not necessarily the type of success I
did<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.590> that's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.039> combination<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
did have I think that's a combination of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
did have I think that's a combination of
hard<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> good<00:00:48.930> coaching<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hard work and good coaching and just the

hard work and good coaching and just the
team<00:00:50.730> working<00:00:50.969> together<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> everything's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
team working together and everything's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.400 
team working together and everything's
good<00:00:52.649> will<00:00:52.920> fall<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.250> place<00:00:53.340> order<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
good will fall into place order and a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
good will fall into place order and a
did<00:00:55.410> definitely<00:00:55.920> worked<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.370> I'd

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
did definitely worked out well I'd

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
did definitely worked out well I'd
