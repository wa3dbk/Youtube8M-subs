Alessi's<00:00:05.730> holeshot<00:00:06.770> amazing<00:00:08.120> when<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.300> time

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
Alessi's holeshot amazing when you time

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.440 
Alessi's holeshot amazing when you time
the<00:00:09.960> gate<00:00:10.200> sometimes<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.759> do<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the gate sometimes you can do this and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.390 
the gate sometimes you can do this and
get<00:00:12.540> away<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.710> when<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.070> doesn't

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
get away with it but when it doesn't

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.570 
get away with it but when it doesn't
work<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:15.330> turns<00:00:15.780> bad<00:00:16.289> because<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.039> run<00:00:17.279> into

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
work it turns bad because you run into

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.810 
work it turns bad because you run into
the<00:00:17.699> gate<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.500> me<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.949> not<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.400> fan<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the gate so for me I'm not a fan of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450 
the gate so for me I'm not a fan of
timing<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> gate<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.830> watch<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
timing the gate I think you watch the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.250 
timing the gate I think you watch the
gate<00:00:23.670> watch<00:00:24.359> closely

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
gate watch closely

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.130 
gate watch closely

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
things that you need to do to get a good

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.979 
things that you need to do to get a good
start<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.309> with<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.460> said<00:00:32.790> let's<00:00:33.510> keep<00:00:33.809> an

fifth having a problem and then dropping
back<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.920> ending<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.610> 7th

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
back a little bit in ending up in 7th

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.959 
back a little bit in ending up in 7th
place<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> said<00:00:44.250> let's<00:00:44.640> watch

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
place so with that said let's watch

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.500 
place so with that said let's watch
Villopoto<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.079> his<00:00:46.770> setup<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.489> his<00:00:47.850> passes

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Villopoto in his setup and his passes

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
Villopoto in his setup and his passes
and<00:00:48.539> exactly<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.770> done<00:00:51.140> first<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.379> all

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and exactly how it's done first of all

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
and exactly how it's done first of all
remember<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> choice<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
remember you have to have a choice of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650 
remember you have to have a choice of
lines<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.980> can't<00:00:56.340> pass<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> rider<00:00:57.329> if

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
lines and you can't pass a rider if

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.160 
lines and you can't pass a rider if
you're<00:00:57.930> following<00:00:58.530> him<00:00:59.539> there<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:00.899> ways

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you're following him there are two ways

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.490 
you're following him there are two ways
to<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> pass<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.969> come<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to make a pass one come in from the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520 
to make a pass one come in from the
inside<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> take<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> line<00:01:06.000> away<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.689> set<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
inside and take the line away or set up

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.020 
inside and take the line away or set up
wide<00:01:09.290> if<00:01:10.290> you're<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> crossover

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
wide if you're going to do a crossover

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.960 
wide if you're going to do a crossover
pass<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.290> set<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.680> wide<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
pass you have to set up wide so that you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
pass you have to set up wide so that you
can<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> alongside<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> rider<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
can get alongside of the rider so you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460 
can get alongside of the rider so you
can<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> cut<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.210> come<00:01:18.450> back<00:01:18.720> underneath

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
can make the cut to come back underneath

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.870 
can make the cut to come back underneath
him<00:01:20.360> then<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.750> cut<00:01:22.080> back<00:01:22.350> underneath

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
him then as you cut back underneath

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.219 
him then as you cut back underneath
hopefully<00:01:23.880> you'll<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> good<00:01:24.780> Drive

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
hopefully you'll get a good Drive

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
hopefully you'll get a good Drive
running<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.979> shorter<00:01:26.490> distance<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.420> able<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
running a shorter distance to be able to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440 
running a shorter distance to be able to
catch<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> pass<00:01:29.070> him<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.090> next

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
catch and pass him going down that next

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.560 
catch and pass him going down that next
straightaway<00:01:31.520> once<00:01:32.520> you've<00:01:32.729> made<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.030> pass

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
straightaway once you've made that pass

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230 
straightaway once you've made that pass
it's<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.439> time<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.829> start<00:01:35.310> focusing<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's then time to start focusing on the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.649 
it's then time to start focusing on the
next<00:01:36.720> rider<00:01:39.740> lap<00:01:40.740> 2<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.400> Ryan<00:01:41.700> Villopoto<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
next rider lap 2 and Ryan Villopoto is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
next rider lap 2 and Ryan Villopoto is
not<00:01:42.960> even<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.950> board<00:01:44.130> yet<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.299> that's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
not even on the board yet but that's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.569 
not even on the board yet but that's
gonna<00:01:46.200> change<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:47.220> shortly

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
gonna change very shortly

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
gonna change very shortly
obviously<00:01:50.579> being<00:01:50.880> faster<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.259> important

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
obviously being faster is very important

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.179 
obviously being faster is very important
but<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.280> making<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.420> decisions<00:01:54.829> at<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
but also making good decisions at this

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.090 
but also making good decisions at this
point<00:01:56.549> Ryan<00:01:56.909> Villopoto<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> decide<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:59.040> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
point Ryan Villopoto has to decide do I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.450 
point Ryan Villopoto has to decide do I
go<00:01:59.399> inside<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.420> try<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> make<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> pass<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.799> am

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
go inside to try to make the pass or am

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
go inside to try to make the pass or am
I<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.640> close<00:02:03.270> enough<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> go

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
I not close enough so I need to go

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.850 
I not close enough so I need to go
outside<00:02:05.340> till<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.420> carry<00:02:06.719> more<00:02:07.110> momentum

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
outside till I can carry more momentum

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.279 
outside till I can carry more momentum
around<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> corner<00:02:08.940> hopefully<00:02:09.690> getting<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
around the corner hopefully getting the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.740 
around the corner hopefully getting the
drive<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.129> able<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> make<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.819> pass<00:02:12.030> down
