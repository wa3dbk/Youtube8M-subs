pretty similar specs it's got a little
bit<00:00:50.969> less<00:00:51.120> GPU<00:00:51.570> power<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.079> whatever<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bit less GPU power but whatever it's a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.000 
bit less GPU power but whatever it's a
snapdragon<00:00:54.449> instead<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> Tegra<00:00:55.500> bats<00:00:55.710> about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
