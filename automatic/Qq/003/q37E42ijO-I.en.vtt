00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:44.420 
hear that's easier just to deal with
okay<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.870> got<00:02:34.290> something<00:02:34.680> nice<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:43.680> just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
okay so I got something nice and I just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.729 
okay so I got something nice and I just
think<00:02:47.480> take<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:49.160> whole<00:02:50.160> mixture<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:51.269> I

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
think take this whole mixture here I

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.729 
think take this whole mixture here I
might<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:52.920> add<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.989> little<00:02:54.989> bit<00:02:55.170> more<00:02:55.260> baking

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
might just add a little bit more baking

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.830 
might just add a little bit more baking
so<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.880> actually<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.329> put<00:02:57.480> an<00:02:57.600> old

and this is actually pretty good okay um
I<00:05:46.960> really<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.470> it<00:05:47.830> but<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.190> think<00:05:48.340> I<00:05:48.700> would

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
I really like it but I think I would

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.520 
I really like it but I think I would
want<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.450> little<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:50.530> little<00:05:51.310> more<00:05:51.870> vibrant<00:05:52.870> a

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
want it a little a little more vibrant a

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.280 
want it a little a little more vibrant a
little<00:05:54.190> more<00:05:54.280> Chingy<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:55.510> I<00:05:55.540> think<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.870> do<00:05:55.930> this

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
little more Chingy so I think I do this

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.800 
little more Chingy so I think I do this
maybe<00:05:57.220> one<00:05:57.550> more<00:05:57.730> time<00:05:57.970> within<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.450> month

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
maybe one more time within the month

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.890 
maybe one more time within the month
not<00:05:59.620> like<00:05:59.800> right<00:05:59.980> so<00:06:00.220> this<00:06:00.520> is<00:06:00.580> after<00:06:00.820> um<00:06:01.330> its

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
not like right so this is after um its

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.659 
not like right so this is after um its
died<00:06:02.380> and<00:06:02.790> straightened<00:06:03.790> kind<00:06:04.090> of<00:06:04.240> I<00:06:05.669> don't
