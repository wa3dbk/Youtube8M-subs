00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this series just gets so far behind like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
this series just gets so far behind like
I<00:01:05.489> mean<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:06.840> chapters<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:08.010> came<00:01:08.220> out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
I mean the two chapters just came out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210 
I mean the two chapters just came out
and<00:01:08.810> obviously<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.320> were<00:01:10.380> late<00:01:11.189> because

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and obviously they were late because

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
and obviously they were late because
those<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.210> chapters<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.810> I've<00:01:12.869> already

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
those two chapters I think I've already

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
those two chapters I think I've already
been<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.799> weeks<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
been out for like two weeks now and I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
been out for like two weeks now and I
feel<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.360> we're<00:01:15.659> still<00:01:15.840> probably<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.409> two

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
feel like we're still probably about two

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.399 
feel like we're still probably about two
weeks<00:01:16.770> behind<00:01:17.119> with<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> actual<00:01:18.750> translation

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
weeks behind with the actual translation

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
weeks behind with the actual translation

the first chapter that came out today I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.320 
the first chapter that came out today I
think<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:34.940> was<00:02:35.000> chapter<00:02:35.860> 266<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.100> focuses<00:02:38.000> on

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
think it was chapter 266 it focuses on

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.440 
think it was chapter 266 it focuses on
Jude<00:02:38.750> arm<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.320> Alibaba<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.460> their<00:02:40.760> situation

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
Jude arm and Alibaba and their situation

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.420 
Jude arm and Alibaba and their situation

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
use any magic at all besides very weak

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.080 
use any magic at all besides very weak
and<00:02:58.700> limited<00:02:59.150> magic<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:00.130> also<00:03:01.130> from<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:02.060> I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and limited magic and also from what I

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.820 
and limited magic and also from what I
saw<00:03:02.330> from<00:03:02.360> Furies<00:03:02.840> from<00:03:03.020> chi<00:03:03.200> bits<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.560> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
saw from Furies from chi bits in the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.650 
saw from Furies from chi bits in the
last<00:03:04.100> chapter<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.700> did<00:03:04.940> most<00:03:05.180> likely

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
last chapter of you I did most likely

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.810 
last chapter of you I did most likely
this<00:03:05.810> could<00:03:06.020> possibly<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.590> Alma<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.340> wrong<00:03:07.490> now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
this could possibly be Alma to wrong now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.210 
this could possibly be Alma to wrong now
that<00:03:08.000> might<00:03:08.300> be<00:03:08.510> what<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.930> place<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.830> I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
that might be what this place is and I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.550 
that might be what this place is and I
does<00:03:10.460> seem<00:03:10.760> very<00:03:10.970> plausible<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.410> big

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
does seem very plausible but the big

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.840 
does seem very plausible but the big
question<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.980> how<00:03:13.220> do<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.430> leave<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.820> area

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
question is how do you leave that area

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.130 
question is how do you leave that area
when<00:03:14.270> they're<00:03:14.390> already<00:03:14.570> there<00:03:14.750> i<00:03:14.810> mean<00:03:14.990> they

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
when they're already there i mean they

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.080 
when they're already there i mean they
have<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.560> know<00:03:15.680> black<00:03:15.950> crew<00:03:16.160> call<00:03:16.340> around<00:03:16.640> and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
have you know black crew call around and

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.360 
have you know black crew call around and
then<00:03:17.240> you<00:03:17.270> have<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.720> where<00:03:17.750> all<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.130> stuff

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
then you have it to where all the stuff

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.590 
then you have it to where all the stuff
like<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.940> know<00:03:20.060> where<00:03:20.240> they're<00:03:20.360> just

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
like this you know where they're just

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600 
like this you know where they're just
trapped<00:03:20.840> there<00:03:21.140> they<00:03:21.350> can't<00:03:21.560> use<00:03:21.680> magic<00:03:21.950> how

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
trapped there they can't use magic how

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.670 
trapped there they can't use magic how
are<00:03:22.730> these<00:03:22.850> supposed<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.150> escape<00:03:23.500> from<00:03:24.500> what<00:03:24.650> i

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
are these supposed to escape from what i

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
are these supposed to escape from what i
can<00:03:24.830> assume<00:03:25.460> from<00:03:25.820> what<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.120> going<00:03:26.330> on<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.540> if

can assume from what is going on here if

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.110 
can assume from what is going on here if
the<00:03:27.350> entire<00:03:27.650> area<00:03:27.710> is<00:03:28.190> covered<00:03:28.580> in<00:03:28.820> nothing
