to slowly lower down with the with the
white<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:58.320> hand<00:00:58.710> to

away and slowly lower that down so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020 
away and slowly lower that down so
what's<00:01:34.110> happening<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> she's<00:01:35.030> loading

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
what's happening is that she's loading

what's happening is that she's loading
the<00:01:36.150> tendon<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.229> lengthened<00:01:37.860> state<00:01:39.079> instead

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the tendon in a lengthened state instead

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
the tendon in a lengthened state instead
of<00:01:40.200> doing<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> shortened<00:01:41.130> state<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:42.270> just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
of doing it in a shortened state we just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.340 
of doing it in a shortened state we just
unload<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> tendon<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.950> bring

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
unload the tendon when we bring

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.160 
unload the tendon when we bring
back<00:01:44.470> up<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.330> we'll<00:01:46.330> just<00:01:46.479> demonstrate<00:01:46.630> that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
back up and we'll just demonstrate that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.670 
back up and we'll just demonstrate that
once<00:01:47.409> more<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:47.950> slowly<00:01:48.570> lower<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.720> down<00:01:49.869> all

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
once more so slowly lower it down all

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.300 
once more so slowly lower it down all
the<00:01:50.920> way<00:01:51.070> down<00:01:51.340> right<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.869> bottom<00:01:53.310> and

the way down right to the bottom and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.060 
the way down right to the bottom and
then<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.610> use<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.940> other<00:01:55.060> hand<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.830> bring

then to use the other hand to just bring

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.149 
then to use the other hand to just bring
the<00:01:57.250> wrist<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:59.020> what<00:01:59.470> we<00:01:59.590> would<00:01:59.740> do<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.040> we

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
the wrist and what we would do is we

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.850 
the wrist and what we would do is we
would<00:02:00.189> prescribe<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:00.850> exercise<00:02:01.860> three

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
would prescribe this exercise three

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.460 
would prescribe this exercise three

and strengthen their tendon the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.309 
and strengthen their tendon the
eccentric<00:02:13.840> exercises<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:15.780> rejuvenate<00:02:16.780> that

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
eccentric exercises will rejuvenate that

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.979 
eccentric exercises will rejuvenate that
