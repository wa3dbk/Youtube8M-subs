00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
expectations but I think we're going to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
expectations but I think we're going to
be<00:00:33.690> disappointed<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:34.800> maybe

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
be disappointed and then maybe

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240 
be disappointed and then maybe
reappointed<00:00:36.559> we're<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> place

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
begins today with a hard aspect to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
begins today with a hard aspect to
Saturn<00:00:42.870> making<00:00:43.500> thinking<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> communication

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
Saturn making thinking and communication

Saturn making thinking and communication
more<00:00:44.879> serious<00:00:45.360> Venus<00:00:46.140> makes<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> same

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
more serious Venus makes the same

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
more serious Venus makes the same
pattern<00:00:47.280> later<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> day<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.840> evening

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
pattern later in the day or this evening

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
pattern later in the day or this evening
making<00:00:49.890> social<00:00:50.399> activities<00:00:51.180> more<00:00:51.680> serious

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
making social activities more serious

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
making social activities more serious
and<00:00:52.890> yet<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.910> Sun<00:00:54.120> squares<00:00:54.600> Spacey<00:00:55.020> dreamy

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and yet the Sun squares Spacey dreamy

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
and yet the Sun squares Spacey dreamy
Neptune<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.250> maybe<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.090> care<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
Neptune so maybe we don't care well I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
Neptune so maybe we don't care well I
think<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.590> right<00:00:58.800> Geoff<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
think you're right Geoff I think that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
think you're right Geoff I think that
the<00:00:59.879> Sun<00:01:00.090> squared<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.660> Neptune<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.559> happens

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the Sun squared in Neptune which happens

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.210 
the Sun squared in Neptune which happens
a<00:01:02.070> couple<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.430> times<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.879> year<00:01:02.910> often<00:01:03.979> brings<00:01:04.979> us

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a couple of times a year often brings us

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.000 
a couple of times a year often brings us
to<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> place<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.689> difficult<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.770> tell

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to a place where it's difficult to tell

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
to a place where it's difficult to tell
the<00:01:08.220> difference<00:01:08.640> between<00:01:08.850> what's<00:01:09.540> real<00:01:09.810> we

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the difference between what's real we

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410 
the difference between what's real we
have<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> Saturn<00:01:10.770> aspects<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.430> real<00:01:11.760> but

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
have the Saturn aspects that's real but

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
have the Saturn aspects that's real but
it's<00:01:12.960> difficult<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> tell<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> difference

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it's difficult to tell the difference

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's difficult to tell the difference
between<00:01:14.700> what's<00:01:15.270> real<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> what's<00:01:16.140> imagined

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
between what's real and what's imagined

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
between what's real and what's imagined
and<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.520> create<00:01:17.759> some<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> strange

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and that can create some kind of strange

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
and that can create some kind of strange
things<00:01:19.619> throughout<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> day<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:21.150> we're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
things throughout the day when we're

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
things throughout the day when we're
dealing<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.049> results<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> our

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
dealing with the results of our

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
dealing with the results of our
imagination<00:01:23.490> yeah<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.240> almost<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.869> if

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
imagination yeah it's almost as if

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
imagination yeah it's almost as if
there's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.470> disinterested<00:01:26.400> Center<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> Sun

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
there's a disinterested Center the Sun

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.920 
there's a disinterested Center the Sun
is<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> center<00:01:28.460> Neptune<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.150> sort<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
is the center Neptune can be sort of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
is the center Neptune can be sort of
disconnected<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:32.430> fuzzy<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
disconnected and that we're fuzzy in the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
disconnected and that we're fuzzy in the
middle<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.619> hard<00:01:34.920> things<00:01:35.280> all

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
middle but there are hard things all

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
middle but there are hard things all
around<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.030> edges<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> deal

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
around the edges that we have to deal

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740 
around the edges that we have to deal
with<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> hard<00:01:39.360> things

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
with and I think that the hard things

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
with and I think that the hard things
around<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.320> edges<00:01:40.490> including<00:01:41.490> Mars<00:01:41.820> making

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
around the edges including Mars making

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
around the edges including Mars making
some<00:01:42.990> very<00:01:43.350> interesting<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.340> difficult

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
some very interesting and difficult

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
some very interesting and difficult
aspects<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.380> ongoing<00:01:47.130> uranus-pluto

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
aspects with the ongoing uranus-pluto

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
aspects with the ongoing uranus-pluto
square<00:01:47.640> remember<00:01:48.540> Uranus<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> planet<00:01:49.409> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
square remember Uranus the planet of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
square remember Uranus the planet of
shock<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> surprise<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.420> Pluto<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.320> planet

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
shock and surprise and Pluto the planet

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.910 
shock and surprise and Pluto the planet
of<00:01:52.829> depth<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.369> intensity<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.780> being<00:01:55.320> rattled

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
of depth and intensity are being rattled

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.240 
of depth and intensity are being rattled
today<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.640> Mars<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.590> makes<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
today by Mars and I think it it makes it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.609 
today by Mars and I think it it makes it
so<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.909> think<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.600> escape<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.530> are

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
so that if we think we can escape we are

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.730 
so that if we think we can escape we are
brought<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:03.030> reality<00:02:03.409> very<00:02:04.409> quickly

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
brought back into reality very quickly

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
brought back into reality very quickly
and<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> deal<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.790> what's<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.149> on

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and we have to deal with what's going on
