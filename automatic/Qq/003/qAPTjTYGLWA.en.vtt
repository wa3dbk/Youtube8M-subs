00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.229
 and it made me scary to make fun of your 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.790
 subscribers who asked you for a review of 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.969
 a game that they wanted and you ended 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.799
 summarizing I earn for pc by god was 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.990
 obvious that it was not the game they wanted 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.150
 but you practically said I'm worth my 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.560
 subscribers I want this and the others 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 that your mother will be upset 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.660
 I understand that you are already 65 years old and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.700
 what is your inapam card but not 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.010
 invent do not put your bows either 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.860
 because if we would not be nobody nobody 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.540
 you owe to us who are your bosses 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.540
 have a nice day 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 well that another exists 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.680
 good to see, it would be better if you 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.680
 look overwhelmed 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 now if I'm not going to disappoint them this time 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 I have here the version of megaman that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 you have kindly been me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 asking for months already know me 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.140
 they win the blue short with their 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 cap if they remember him not so 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 without further ado start to review 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 mega man wai for game boy 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.840
 in the era of the game boy brick had 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.630
 three types of games the relationships of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.130
 old nes pretty faithful games with 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.530
 enough modifications for 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 considered new and original and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 low calorie versions of his 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.750
 counterpart of the month 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.030
 unfortunately mega man the game boy is 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.100
 of the latter instead of facing 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.780
 to new master robots you face 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.140
 recycled robots of the first two 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.390
 megaman games or even worse only four 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.030
 of them specifically those of megaman 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.679
 1 have their own level those of mega 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.960
 controls you face in the castle of 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.490
 wylie directly like that without battling 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.170
 only getting into a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.929
 teleporter that takes you straight to 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.640
 they imagine that again while and at 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.590
 find out that it was the version 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.869
 of game boy and contractual obligation 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 He did not want to spend a lot of money and looked in 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.860
 your junk recycler old robots 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.550
 that mega man had previously 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.409
 defeated or been there is only one new robot 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.179
 and original call in care that yes 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.009
 we consider that they get their fair weapon 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.230
 before the last level because the truth is not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.780
 you have no case that you are fond of her 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.300
 because you will only use it once though 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.310
 an equal moment and you do not have 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 economic courses to build robots 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 originals from where I get to build 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.620
 not one but two castles and one in the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.510
 space although yes every castle 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 has a dirty room 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.450
 I wish the feng shui of this 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.790
 mad scientist does not become fashionable the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.130
 Well, well, they call me for game boy 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.350
 which worthy game of the saga is quite 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.450
 difficult not so much as others because of the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.070
 limited amount of levels but this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.320
 is balanced with the absence of tanks 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.600
 of energy the infrequency with which 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.310
 additional lives appear and it's even 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.170
 very rare to run into a capsule for 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.580
 recover energy there are those who when 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.440
 you find one of those chinches 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.840
 they heat boomerang and it 's that you pass 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.880
 hours destroying the see if a soul 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.490
 charitable is fine is no longer let's say 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.270
 a capsule is a capsule or already of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.270
 you lose or a sister 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.599
 a life 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.739
 similar to the nes games here 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.930
 they get the weapons from the robots 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.519
 defeated with a nothing disturbing 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.439
 graphic sequence of the interior of 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.970
 megaman in case you ever had the 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:32.270
 concern about how big was his 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.100
 pylorus this is your chance the end 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.230
 Well, it's nothing special 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.390
 it seems that the megaman games both 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.070
 Officials as unofficial stand out for 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.050
 its mediocre finishes which is 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.410
 frustrating if we consider what 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.910
 it cost you as a video player 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.160
 finished the filthy game the only thing that 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.170
 appears is the blue short reading the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.460
 names of the enemies that he defeated like 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.980
 if it will be required in the future 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.450
 close a sarcastic comment 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.970
 Regarding the irony that the little bird 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.100
 that throws you eggs is called pee or 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.490
 that iceman looks like the lost twin of 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.560
 Kenny from South Park or as Hitman you 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.330
 he smiles very tenderly even though 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.110
 a few minutes ago I was leaving 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.500
 mother 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.730
 now without much laughter truth wey a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.959
 At the moment they call me, they have started walking 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.470
 surely something good will happen in 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.470
 this end 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.630
 hold still hold keep walking 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.630
 walking 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.190
 i 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.720
 I 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.270
 I 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.330
 and me
