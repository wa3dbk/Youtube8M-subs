 first it is sure how to sell its 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.280

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 that a lot of subscribers lose a lot 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 of credit by selling their players because 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.860
 that they make a very big mistake and that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.960

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.510
