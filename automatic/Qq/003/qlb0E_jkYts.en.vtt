00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hello this is second update on my hi-def

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.760 
hello this is second update on my hi-def
nes<00:00:04.290> adapter<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.400> your<00:00:05.520> NES<00:00:05.910> system<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.899> in

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
nes adapter for your NES system and in

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.669 
nes adapter for your NES system and in
the<00:00:08.099> last<00:00:08.280> week<00:00:08.610> I've<00:00:08.880> implemented<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:10.050> video

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the last week I've implemented all video

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.419 
the last week I've implemented all video
features<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> have

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
features that it's going to have I have

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.650 
features that it's going to have I have
scaling<00:00:14.429> now<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.150> selectable

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
scaling now so you have selectable

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.710 
scaling now so you have selectable
scaling<00:00:16.550> scanline<00:00:17.550> generators<00:00:18.330> there's<00:00:18.600> two

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
scaling scanline generators there's two

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.210 
scaling scanline generators there's two
types<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.140> scanline<00:00:19.529> generator<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.039> I'll<00:00:20.100> go

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
types of scanline generator so I'll go

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.080 
types of scanline generator so I'll go
over<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> minute

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
over that in a minute

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.660 
over that in a minute
there's<00:00:21.930> also<00:00:22.340> interpolation<00:00:23.340> if<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.519> want

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
there's also interpolation if you want

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.480 
there's also interpolation if you want
to<00:00:23.730> blur<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.230> slightly<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:26.189> there's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to blur it slightly and then there's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
to blur it slightly and then there's
horizontal<00:00:27.390> width<00:00:27.720> adjustment<00:00:28.230> nuts<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
horizontal width adjustment nuts out of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.170 
horizontal width adjustment nuts out of
stops<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.740> want<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.309> proper<00:00:32.820> four

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
stops now so if you want a proper four

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
stops now so if you want a proper four
to<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:33.420> aspect<00:00:33.960> ratio<00:00:34.320> picture<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to three aspect ratio picture now you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.770 
to three aspect ratio picture now you
can<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.360> selectable

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
can have that and it's all selectable

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590 
can have that and it's all selectable
through<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> menu<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.149> there's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> menu

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
through the menu now so there's a menu

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.459 
through the menu now so there's a menu
I'll<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.440> through<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
I'll go through that in a little bit and

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
I'll go through that in a little bit and
I<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.370> actual<00:00:44.700> proper<00:00:45.270> captured

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I will have some actual proper captured

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
I will have some actual proper captured
video<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.950> running<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.309> 720p

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
video off of this I'm running at 720p

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.160 
video off of this I'm running at 720p
right<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.960> money

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
right now because that's not money

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
right now because that's not money
capture<00:00:50.100> device<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.670> capture<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.390> we'll<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
capture device can capture so we'll get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.010 
capture device can capture so we'll get
into<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.270> that's<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.449> I've<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:54.570> done

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
into that but that's what I've got done

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
into that but that's what I've got done
enough<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.739> been<00:00:55.860> working<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.190> audio<00:00:56.579> but

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
enough so been working on audio but

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
enough so been working on audio but
that'll<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> separate<00:00:57.510> update<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.579> we'll

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that'll be a separate update so we'll

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
that'll be a separate update so we'll
get<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.850> with<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> I'll<00:01:01.230> hook<00:01:01.469> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
get on with it here and I'll hook this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
get on with it here and I'll hook this
in<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> we'll<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:03.110> what<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> next

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
in and we'll see what I got so the next

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
in and we'll see what I got so the next
step<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> menu<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> menu<00:01:08.280> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
step up is the menu and in the menu you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
step up is the menu and in the menu you
can<00:01:08.909> select<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> video<00:01:09.900> options<00:01:10.409> right

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
can select all the video options right

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
can select all the video options right
now<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> press<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> hotkey

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
now so to get there you press the hotkey

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.330 
now so to get there you press the hotkey
which<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.470> configurable<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
which is very configurable and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580 
which is very configurable and
controller<00:01:14.670> 1<00:01:14.939> 2<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> whatever<00:01:15.810> combination

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
controller 1 2 and whatever combination

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.090 
controller 1 2 and whatever combination
you<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.960> there's<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> menu<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you like so there's the menu and then I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
you like so there's the menu and then I
can<00:01:20.280> select<00:01:20.400> video<00:01:20.909> options<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
can select video options that's the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
can select video options that's the
thing<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.200> worked<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.210> got

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
thing I've worked on and in there we got

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
thing I've worked on and in there we got
horizontal<00:01:24.780> stretching<00:01:25.350> scaling<00:01:26.100> scanlines

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
horizontal stretching scaling scanlines

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
horizontal stretching scaling scanlines
and<00:01:26.909> interpolation<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.780> interpolation<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and interpolation and interpolation is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
and interpolation and interpolation is
blurring<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.759> we'll<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.329> these

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
blurring so we'll get to all these

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.249 
blurring so we'll get to all these
verses<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.040> stretching<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.270> by

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
verses or it's all stretching so by

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.240 
verses or it's all stretching so by
pressing<00:01:34.650> left<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
pressing left and right on the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
pressing left and right on the
controller<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> control<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.439> width<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
controller you can control the width of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
controller you can control the width of
the<00:01:38.070> screen<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> little<00:01:39.990> menu

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the screen and I make the little menu

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
the screen and I make the little menu
thing<00:01:40.680> hide<00:01:41.579> itself<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
thing hide itself so you can actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
thing hide itself so you can actually
watch<00:01:43.320> what's<00:01:43.680> happening<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.220> why<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
watch what's happening that's why it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
watch what's happening that's why it
looks<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.140> at

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
looks like this so right now I'm at

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.420 
looks like this so right now I'm at
exactly<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> 4x<00:01:47.659> scale<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.619> horizontal<00:01:49.649> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
exactly a 4x scale on the horizontal so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
exactly a 4x scale on the horizontal so
every<00:01:50.729> NES<00:01:51.180> pixels<00:01:51.860> occupied<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.220> HDMI<00:01:53.939> pixel

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
every NES pixels occupied for HDMI pixel

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
every NES pixels occupied for HDMI pixel
so<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> hold<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> button<00:01:55.920> down<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.369> will

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
so if you hold the button down it will

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
so if you hold the button down it will
scroll<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.210> these<00:01:57.360> various

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
scroll and then it has these various

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
scroll and then it has these various
stops<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.170> here's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> 4<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> 3<00:01:59.250> aspect

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
stops so here's a like a 4 to 3 aspect

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.690 
stops so here's a like a 4 to 3 aspect
ratio<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> 16<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> 10<00:02:01.890> monitor<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
ratio if you have a 16 to 10 monitor and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.630 
ratio if you have a 16 to 10 monitor and
you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.420> doing<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:05.250> you'll<00:02:05.399> stop

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you can keep doing that and you'll stop

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
you can keep doing that and you'll stop
again<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.180> 4<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> 3<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> 16<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> 9<00:02:07.710> aspect

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
again for 4 to 3 for a 16 to 9 aspect

and<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> keep<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.379> they'll<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.769> 3x<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
and if you keep going they'll do 3x and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.509 
and if you keep going they'll do 3x and
then<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.989> really<00:02:13.680> really<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.370> all

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
then if you really really want it all

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.339 
then if you really really want it all
squashed<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.450> it'll<00:02:15.750> go<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.019> way<00:02:16.049> down<00:02:16.200> to

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
squashed up it'll go all the way down to

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.890 
squashed up it'll go all the way down to
2x<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.670> looks<00:02:17.819> pretty<00:02:17.879> ridiculous<00:02:18.540> right

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
2x so it looks pretty ridiculous right

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.530 
2x so it looks pretty ridiculous right
now<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.670> hey<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.849> thought<00:02:21.090> I'd<00:02:21.269> leave<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
now but hey I just thought I'd leave the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.089 
now but hey I just thought I'd leave the
option<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.989> there<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> usually<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.950> run

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
option in there so I usually like to run

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.339 
option in there so I usually like to run
it<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.340> 4x<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.209> seems<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.599> pretty<00:02:24.810> decent

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
it at 4x that seems to be pretty decent

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.289 
it at 4x that seems to be pretty decent
in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> video<00:02:25.799> yes<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.220> picture<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> shifted

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
in the video yes the picture is shifted

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.410 
in the video yes the picture is shifted
to<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:27.799> somewhat<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
to the right somewhat this is because of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.380 
to the right somewhat this is because of
the<00:02:30.860> stuff<00:02:31.860> I've<00:02:32.069> done<00:02:32.099> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> software<00:02:33.030> but

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the stuff I've done in the software but

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.839 
the stuff I've done in the software but
I<00:02:33.420> will<00:02:33.750> fix<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
I will fix that it's just this is just a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.869 
I will fix that it's just this is just a
very<00:02:36.090> preliminary<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.379> I'll<00:02:37.860> leave<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.129> on<00:02:38.280> 4x

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
very preliminary so I'll leave it on 4x

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.910 
very preliminary so I'll leave it on 4x
because<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.659> so<00:02:40.409> then<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.799> out<00:02:40.890> of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
because I like that so then I get out of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.610 
because I like that so then I get out of
that<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.640> next<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.390> scaling<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.379> right

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
that the next one is scaling so right

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.770 
that the next one is scaling so right
now<00:02:43.769> there's<00:02:44.040> no<00:02:44.190> scaling<00:02:44.549> at<00:02:44.819> all<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
now there's no scaling at all it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.259 
now there's no scaling at all it's
basically<00:02:46.110> raw<00:02:46.470> nes<00:02:47.069> pixels<00:02:47.579> right<00:02:47.819> now<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
basically raw nes pixels right now so

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.080 
basically raw nes pixels right now so
there's<00:02:48.660> also<00:02:48.840> there's<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> HQ<00:02:50.250> 2x<00:02:50.670> which

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
there's also there's like a HQ 2x which

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.410 
there's also there's like a HQ 2x which
is<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:52.819> there's<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.940> 3x<00:02:54.980> 4x<00:02:56.060> which<00:02:57.060> i've<00:02:57.209> gone

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
is that there's a 3x 4x which i've gone

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
is that there's a 3x 4x which i've gone
over<00:02:57.780> before<00:02:58.609> scale<00:02:59.609> 2x<00:03:00.150> let's<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.319> 3x<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.160> of

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
over before scale 2x let's get 3x and of

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.430 
over before scale 2x let's get 3x and of
course<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.879> x-ray<00:03:03.480> mode<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.870> what<00:03:03.989> x-ray

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
course the x-ray mode and what x-ray

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.650 
course the x-ray mode and what x-ray
mode<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> debug<00:03:05.970> mode<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.450> left

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
mode is this is a debug mode that I left

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.059 
mode is this is a debug mode that I left
in<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.049> thought<00:03:07.200> looked<00:03:07.440> really<00:03:07.829> cool

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
in because I thought looked really cool

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.160 
in because I thought looked really cool
if<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.849> play<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.180> game<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.510> little<00:03:09.690> bit<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.019> can

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
if I play the game a little bit you can

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.539 
if I play the game a little bit you can
kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.650> how<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.069> works

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
kind of see how that works

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.059 
kind of see how that works
it's<00:03:12.299> just<00:03:12.510> basically<00:03:12.870> detecting<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.560> edges

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
it's just basically detecting the edges

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.789 
it's just basically detecting the edges
of<00:03:14.340> objects<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:16.019> kind<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.260> surprising<00:03:16.769> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
of objects so it's kind of surprising to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.509 
of objects so it's kind of surprising to
me<00:03:16.980> how<00:03:17.010> playable<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.880> actually<00:03:18.419> is

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
me how playable this actually is

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.490 
me how playable this actually is

seems<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.889> be<00:03:23.720> lagging<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:25.109> bit<00:03:25.139> but<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.700> play

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
seems to be lagging a bit but but I play

seems to be lagging a bit but but I play
this<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.540> actual<00:03:27.989> monitor<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.799> very<00:03:28.849> very

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
this on the actual monitor is very very

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.900 
this on the actual monitor is very very
responsive

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
responsive

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.640 
responsive
there<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.060> absolutely<00:03:33.299> no<00:03:34.139> delay<00:03:34.560> between<00:03:34.950> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
there is absolutely no delay between the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.830 
there is absolutely no delay between the
playing<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.859> game<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.370> seeing<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.389> result

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
playing the game and seeing the result

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.449 
playing the game and seeing the result
on<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:39.989> monitor<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:40.859> will<00:03:41.069> leave<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.250> right

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
on the monitor so I will leave it right

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.860 
on the monitor so I will leave it right
there<00:03:41.519> we'll<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.180> back<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:42.480> menu<00:03:42.750> and

there we'll get back in the menu and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.309 
there we'll get back in the menu and
turn<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.169> x-ray<00:03:43.590> off<00:03:43.769> turn<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.940> at<00:03:45.120> none<00:03:45.359> and

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
turn the x-ray off turn back at none and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.990 
turn the x-ray off turn back at none and
the<00:03:46.650> next<00:03:46.950> one<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.190> scan<00:03:47.459> lines<00:03:47.730> everybody

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the next one is scan lines everybody

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.940 
the next one is scan lines everybody
wants<00:03:48.419> scan<00:03:48.660> line<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.139> we<00:03:49.260> have<00:03:49.290> scan<00:03:49.680> lines

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
wants scan line so we have scan lines

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.650 
wants scan line so we have scan lines
annoy<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.430> works<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.940> like<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.269> other<00:03:51.389> one

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
annoy this works it's like the other one

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.539 
annoy this works it's like the other one
the<00:03:52.230> background<00:03:52.739> goes<00:03:52.950> away<00:03:53.220> when<00:03:53.430> you're

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the background goes away when you're

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.710 
the background goes away when you're
adjusting<00:03:53.639> it<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.299> can<00:03:54.389> see<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.599> you're

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
adjusting it so you can see what you're

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.930 
adjusting it so you can see what you're
doing<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.379> can<00:03:55.530> adjust<00:03:55.799> how<00:03:56.340> deep<00:03:56.700> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
doing and you can adjust how deep you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.550 
doing and you can adjust how deep you
like<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.329> scan<00:03:57.599> line<00:03:57.810> effects<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.319> all

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
like the scan line effects this is all

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.990 
like the scan line effects this is all
the<00:03:58.739> way<00:03:58.889> and<00:03:59.250> we<00:03:59.340> want<00:03:59.549> some<00:03:59.730> more<00:03:59.849> in<00:03:59.940> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the way and we want some more in the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.990 
the way and we want some more in the
middle<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.389> can<00:04:00.419> do<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.870> too<00:04:01.139> like<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
middle you can do that too like that so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.640 
middle you can do that too like that so
this<00:04:03.180> kind<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.419> gives<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.840> little<00:04:04.019> CRT

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
this kind of gives you that little CRT

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.470 
this kind of gives you that little CRT
field<00:04:04.950> these<00:04:05.190> other<00:04:05.370> options<00:04:05.669> here

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
field these other options here

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.409 
field these other options here
we'll<00:04:06.959> make<00:04:07.349> a<00:04:07.410> scan<00:04:08.129> line<00:04:08.160> effect<00:04:09.000> for<00:04:09.269> this

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
we'll make a scan line effect for this

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.990 
we'll make a scan line effect for this
number<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.959> HDMI<00:04:10.739> lines<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.760> would

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
number of HDMI lines so you would

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.130 
number of HDMI lines so you would
probably<00:04:12.299> never<00:04:12.660> use<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:13.379> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.739> 7

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
probably never use this in the 7

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.800 
probably never use this in the 7
20<00:04:14.410> or<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.590> 480p<00:04:15.220> modes<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.120> for<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.359> 1080p

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
20 or the 480p modes but for the 1080p

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.720 
20 or the 480p modes but for the 1080p
almost<00:04:17.500> have<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.829> use<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.220> because<00:04:18.370> if<00:04:18.640> you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
almost have to use this because if you

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.210 
almost have to use this because if you
use<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.940> nes<00:04:19.390> mode<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.410> scan<00:04:20.709> lines<00:04:20.950> look

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
use the nes mode the scan lines look

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.790 
use the nes mode the scan lines look
kind<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.640> funny<00:04:21.940> because<00:04:22.320> there<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.440> not<00:04:23.650> an

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
kind of funny because there is not an

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.390 
kind of funny because there is not an
exact<00:04:24.760> number<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.410> nes<00:04:26.410> scan<00:04:26.680> lines<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.250> will

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
exact number of nes scan lines that will

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.570 
exact number of nes scan lines that will
fit<00:04:28.230> vertically<00:04:29.230> on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.500> out<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.100> 1080p

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
fit vertically on the out of 1080p

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.340 
fit vertically on the out of 1080p
screen<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.390> have<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> have<00:04:31.720> four<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.320> half

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
screen you have to have four and a half

NES<00:04:33.100> scan<00:04:33.430> lines<00:04:33.700> for<00:04:33.970> every<00:04:34.740> HDMI<00:04:35.740> oh<00:04:36.070> sorry<00:04:36.640> I

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
NES scan lines for every HDMI oh sorry I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.370 
NES scan lines for every HDMI oh sorry I
have<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.850> have<00:04:36.940> four<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.450> half<00:04:37.660> HDMI<00:04:38.050> scan

have to have four and a half HDMI scan

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.260 
have to have four and a half HDMI scan
lines<00:04:38.560> for<00:04:38.710> every<00:04:38.800> NES<00:04:39.400> scan<00:04:39.700> line<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.150> this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
lines for every NES scan line and this

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.800 
lines for every NES scan line and this
just<00:04:40.540> looks<00:04:41.260> terrible<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:43.540> what<00:04:43.690> this

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
just looks terrible so that's what this

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.260 
just looks terrible so that's what this
is<00:04:43.990> for<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.200> usually<00:04:44.590> use<00:04:44.740> like<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.760> 3x

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
is for I usually use like the to the 3x

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.020 
is for I usually use like the to the 3x
mode<00:04:46.660> for<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.350> but<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.370> mean<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.760> can<00:04:48.880> select

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
mode for that but I mean you can select

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.460 
mode for that but I mean you can select
whatever<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.480> want<00:04:49.690> if<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:49.960> really<00:04:50.260> want<00:04:50.410> the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
whatever you want if you really want the

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.070 
whatever you want if you really want the
nes<00:04:50.800> locked<00:04:51.100> mode<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.640> 1080p<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:52.540> can<00:04:52.720> use<00:04:52.870> it

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
nes locked mode in 1080p you can use it

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.830 
nes locked mode in 1080p you can use it
so<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:54.370> then<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.610> depth<00:04:54.850> control<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.600> can

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
so and then the depth control you can

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.020 
so and then the depth control you can
just<00:04:56.050> adjust<00:04:56.169> how<00:04:56.710> deep<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.640> really<00:04:57.820> want

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
just adjust how deep you really want

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.020 
just adjust how deep you really want
that<00:04:58.120> effect<00:04:59.340> then<00:05:00.340> finally<00:05:00.910> is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
that effect then finally is

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.210 
that effect then finally is
interpolation<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.169> blurring<00:05:02.650> effect

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
interpolation this is a blurring effect

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.790 
interpolation this is a blurring effect
and<00:05:03.520> basically<00:05:04.510> right<00:05:04.840> now<00:05:05.050> it's<00:05:05.260> off<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:05.710> you

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
and basically right now it's off so you

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.290 
and basically right now it's off so you
hit<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:05.980> button<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.430> can<00:05:06.490> turn<00:05:06.730> it<00:05:06.910> on<00:05:07.000> turn

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
hit the button you can turn it on turn

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.909 
hit the button you can turn it on turn
it<00:05:07.360> off<00:05:07.540> yet<00:05:07.750> shifts<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.140> screen<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.470> little<00:05:08.710> up

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
it off yet shifts the screen a little up

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.330 
it off yet shifts the screen a little up
I<00:05:09.100> fix<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.780> won't<00:05:10.960> do<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:11.410> but<00:05:11.710> so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
I fix that so it won't do that but so

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.850 
I fix that so it won't do that but so
this<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.750> basically<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:14.440> turned<00:05:14.680> off

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
this is with basically it's turned off

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.920 
this is with basically it's turned off
right<00:05:15.100> now<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:15.550> you'll<00:05:16.060> watch<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.270> edges<00:05:16.780> of

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
right now but you'll watch the edges of

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.390 
right now but you'll watch the edges of
things<00:05:17.169> as<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.470> move<00:05:17.710> this<00:05:17.860> up<00:05:18.070> they'll<00:05:18.280> get

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
things as I move this up they'll get

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.460 
things as I move this up they'll get
blurrier<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.060> blurrier<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.169> kind<00:05:20.380> of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
blurrier and blurrier so that kind of

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.400 
blurrier and blurrier so that kind of
simulates<00:05:21.010> more<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.490> CRT<00:05:22.030> feel<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:22.990> using

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
simulates more of a CRT feel so using

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.320 
simulates more of a CRT feel so using
this<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.830> scan<00:05:24.130> lines<00:05:24.430> gives<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.270> a

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
this and the scan lines gives you a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.760 
this and the scan lines gives you a
fairly<00:05:25.780> reasonable<00:05:27.270> CRT<00:05:28.470> emulation<00:05:29.470> so<00:05:29.710> you

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
fairly reasonable CRT emulation so you

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.140 
fairly reasonable CRT emulation so you
know<00:05:29.950> if<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.130> really<00:05:30.280> want<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.669> depth<00:05:30.910> of

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
know if you really want the depth of

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.480 
know if you really want the depth of
scan<00:05:31.450> lines<00:05:31.690> cranked<00:05:32.440> way<00:05:32.590> up<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:33.010> can<00:05:33.160> crank

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
scan lines cranked way up you can crank

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.650 
scan lines cranked way up you can crank
them<00:05:33.640> way<00:05:33.820> up<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.300> hold<00:05:34.479> down<00:05:34.690> at<00:05:34.900> speeds<00:05:35.260> up<00:05:35.500> so

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
them way up to hold down at speeds up so

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.379 
them way up to hold down at speeds up so
that's<00:05:37.660> how<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.110> scan<00:05:38.470> lines<00:05:38.710> work

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.749 

so<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.259> is<00:05:42.439> what<00:05:42.590> I've<00:05:42.740> got<00:05:42.770> right<00:05:42.949> now<00:05:43.400> and

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
so this is what I've got right now and

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.700 
so this is what I've got right now and
I've<00:05:44.180> added<00:05:44.419> a<00:05:44.599> bunch<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.870> stuff<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.379> audio

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
I've added a bunch of stuff to the audio

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.200 
I've added a bunch of stuff to the audio
side<00:05:46.039> of<00:05:46.189> things<00:05:46.400> but<00:05:46.550> I'll<00:05:46.669> do<00:05:46.819> another<00:05:47.000> video

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
side of things but I'll do another video

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.480 
side of things but I'll do another video
on<00:05:47.479> that<00:05:47.629> later<00:05:47.930> cuz<00:05:48.349> that<00:05:48.889> may<00:05:49.039> be<00:05:49.099> a<00:05:49.250> little

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
on that later cuz that may be a little

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.070 
on that later cuz that may be a little
more<00:05:49.639> involved<00:05:49.909> there's<00:05:50.240> quite<00:05:50.659> a<00:05:50.689> bit<00:05:50.960> of

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
more involved there's quite a bit of

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.379 
more involved there's quite a bit of
things<00:05:51.289> I'll<00:05:51.439> have<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.710> do<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.069> so<00:05:53.000> but

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
things I'll have to do on that so but

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.839 
things I'll have to do on that so but
yeah<00:05:54.169> watch<00:05:54.409> for<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.710> video<00:05:55.069> and<00:05:55.370> thanks<00:05:55.819> for

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
yeah watch for that video and thanks for

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.030 
yeah watch for that video and thanks for
watching
