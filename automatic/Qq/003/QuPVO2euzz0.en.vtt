00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
follow some of the things that she said

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.400 
follow some of the things that she said
-<00:02:23.710> she<00:02:24.510> suggested<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.690> use<00:02:25.780> apple<00:02:26.380> cider

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
- she suggested that I use apple cider

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.240 
- she suggested that I use apple cider
vinegar<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:28.660> water<00:02:28.690> mixed<00:02:29.560> together<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
vinegar with water mixed together and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.760 
vinegar with water mixed together and
spray<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.120> hair<00:02:31.150> because<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.410> guess

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
spray on the hair because that I guess

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.520 
spray on the hair because that I guess
it<00:02:32.950> gets<00:02:33.160> rid<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:34.180> or<00:02:34.360> something<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.230> stops

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it gets rid of it or something it stops

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.930 
it gets rid of it or something it stops
