came up with a long time ago for making
bees<00:00:13.639> without<00:00:14.639> actually<00:00:15.059> using<00:00:15.139> beads<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
bees without actually using beads I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.279 
bees without actually using beads I
bought<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.350> bunch<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.210> combs<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.810> yesterday

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
bought a bunch of combs here yesterday

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.229 
the thick ends off I don't need them all
they'll<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> away<00:00:52.789> all<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
now I've got a thin tooth comb and I can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
now I've got a thin tooth comb and I can
use<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.969> making<00:01:00.090> beats<00:01:00.510> take<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> piece<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
use for making beats take a piece of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.460 
use for making beats take a piece of
clay<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> big<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.140> start

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
clay not a big one and just start

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.010 
clay not a big one and just start
rolling<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:07.229> i'm<00:01:07.320> using<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.799> bamboo

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
rolling it now i'm using a bamboo

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.280 
rolling it now i'm using a bamboo
cutting<00:01:10.020> board<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:10.950> Walmart<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
cutting board that i got from Walmart I

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
cutting board that i got from Walmart I
found<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.500> bamboo<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> less<00:01:15.330> tendency<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
found that bamboo has a less tendency to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.700 
found that bamboo has a less tendency to
stick<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.420> see<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.720> slipped<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
stick and see it just slipped so if it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.609 
stick and see it just slipped so if it
flips<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:21.270> join<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:21.900> ends<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
flips you join the two ends like that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.580 
flips you join the two ends like that
and<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.189> continue<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.409> try

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and you just continue and you just try

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.710 
and you just continue and you just try
to<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.130> flipping<00:01:26.430> by

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
to keep it from flipping by

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
to keep it from flipping by
straightening<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> part<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> flipping

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
straightening out the part that flipping

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.679 
straightening out the part that flipping
up<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.630> wanted<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> flip<00:01:31.200> again<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> maybe

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
up just wanted to flip again so maybe

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:45.380 
up just wanted to flip again so maybe
time<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> cut<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.500> again<00:01:38.509> ten<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> half<00:01:44.390> put

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
time to cut it again ten and a half put

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.150 
time to cut it again ten and a half put
that<00:01:45.540> aside

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.650 

now<00:01:51.160> these<00:01:51.280> are<00:01:51.430> going<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.610> recede<00:01:51.970> bees<00:01:52.270> not

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
now these are going to recede bees not

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.410 
now these are going to recede bees not
pony<00:01:53.290> beads<00:01:53.650> out<00:01:53.860> let<00:01:54.490> me<00:01:54.550> describe<00:01:54.910> what<00:01:55.210> seed

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
pony beads out let me describe what seed

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.260 
pony beads out let me describe what seed
beads<00:01:55.660> are<00:01:55.840> they're<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> real<00:01:56.350> tiny<00:01:56.650> beads

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
beads are they're the real tiny beads

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.550 
beads are they're the real tiny beads
that<00:01:58.270> came<00:01:59.230> out<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.770> west<00:02:00.730> and<00:02:01.000> trade<00:02:01.560> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
that came out to the west and trade in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.620 
that came out to the west and trade in
1850s<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.670> from<00:02:04.330> there<00:02:04.510> on<00:02:05.220> before<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.630> they

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
1850s and from there on before that they

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.000 
1850s and from there on before that they
would<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:07.900> been<00:02:08.020> pony<00:02:08.290> beads<00:02:08.619> which<00:02:08.860> were

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
would have been pony beads which were

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.690 
would have been pony beads which were
real<00:02:09.280> thick<00:02:09.780> real<00:02:10.780> big<00:02:11.380> beads<00:02:11.740> almost

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
real thick real big beads almost

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.620 
real thick real big beads almost
ridiculously<00:02:13.450> big<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:15.430> couldn't<00:02:15.730> make<00:02:15.970> tight

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
ridiculously big you couldn't make tight

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.210 
ridiculously big you couldn't make tight
designs<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:19.090> bead<00:02:19.570> work<00:02:19.750> using<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> old<00:02:20.770> style

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
designs in bead work using the old style

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.950 
designs in bead work using the old style
of<00:02:23.790> pony<00:02:24.790> beads<00:02:25.090> because<00:02:25.300> they<00:02:25.570> just<00:02:25.810> were

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
of pony beads because they just were

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.070 
of pony beads because they just were
unevenly<00:02:26.670> made<00:02:27.670> they<00:02:28.180> weren't<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.570> same<00:02:28.750> size

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
unevenly made they weren't the same size

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.980 
unevenly made they weren't the same size
so<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.800> couldn't<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:31.270> anything<00:02:31.480> really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
so you couldn't do anything really

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.670 
so you couldn't do anything really
Jamaican<00:02:32.770> geometric<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> patterns<00:02:34.680> in

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
Jamaican geometric so the patterns in

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.600 
Jamaican geometric so the patterns in
the<00:02:35.740> beadwork<00:02:36.100> tended<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.880> lot<00:02:37.180> less

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the beadwork tended to be a lot less

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.970 
the beadwork tended to be a lot less
geometric<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.790> more<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.350> locking<00:02:41.560> lines

of<00:02:42.930> plain<00:02:43.930> simple<00:02:44.830> designs<00:02:45.700> which<00:02:46.560> really

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
of plain simple designs which really

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.270 
of plain simple designs which really
were<00:02:47.770> what<00:02:48.130> they<00:02:48.280> were<00:02:48.310> making<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
were what they were making out of the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.949 
were what they were making out of the
quill<00:02:51.280> work<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.880> they<00:02:52.060> used<00:02:52.480> before<00:02:52.690> they

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
quill work that they used before they

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.010 
quill work that they used before they
have<00:02:53.080> bees<00:02:53.290> now<00:02:53.650> quiggle<00:02:54.070> quill<00:02:54.400> work<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.730> mean

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
have bees now quiggle quill work I mean

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.430 
have bees now quiggle quill work I mean
they<00:02:56.020> had<00:02:58.830> porcupine<00:02:59.830> quills<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:01.440> they

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
clothing and it would be made in the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.970 
clothing and it would be made in the
patterns<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.610> beadwork<00:03:10.150> except<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.750> was

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
patterns like beadwork except it was

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
now I tried to figure out how to do

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.960 
now I tried to figure out how to do
beats<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.200> long<00:04:06.410> time<00:04:06.680> ago<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:07.250> make<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.580> look

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
beats a long time ago to make it look

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.839 
beats a long time ago to make it look
like<00:04:08.120> beads<00:04:08.420> without<00:04:08.750> actually<00:04:09.110> using<00:04:09.849> beads

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
like beads without actually using beads

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.210 
like beads without actually using beads
there<00:04:11.330> are<00:04:11.660> sculptors<00:04:12.230> who<00:04:12.500> actually<00:04:12.770> have

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
there are sculptors who actually have

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.289 
there are sculptors who actually have
hire<00:04:13.970> people<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.420> make<00:04:15.310> bead<00:04:16.310> patterns<00:04:16.970> for

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
hire people to make bead patterns for

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.720 
hire people to make bead patterns for
them<00:04:17.510> not<00:04:17.720> patterns<00:04:18.200> but<00:04:18.410> so<00:04:19.190> beads<00:04:19.489> onto

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
them not patterns but so beads onto

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.240 
them not patterns but so beads onto
cloth<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.510> then<00:04:20.600> they<00:04:20.720> add<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.680> cloth<00:04:21.980> to

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
cloth and then they add that cloth to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.670 
cloth and then they add that cloth to
their<00:04:22.400> sculpture<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.230> which<00:04:24.230> already<00:04:24.440> has

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
their sculpture and which already has

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.129 
their sculpture and which already has
cloth<00:04:25.180> for<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.480> clothing<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.870> just

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
cloth for the clothing and so I I just

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.240 
cloth for the clothing and so I I just
didn't<00:04:30.380> want<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.560> do<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.740> because<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.190> think

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
didn't want to do that because I think

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.210 
didn't want to do that because I think
that<00:04:31.490> look<00:04:31.850> son<00:04:32.090> sculptured<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.320> just

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
that look son sculptured and so I just

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.990 
that look son sculptured and so I just
take<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.000> cone<00:04:35.479> and<00:04:36.280> roll<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.370> back<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.729> forth

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
take the cone and roll it back and forth

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.409 
take the cone and roll it back and forth
now<00:04:38.240> that's<00:04:38.870> not<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.110> good<00:04:39.290> one<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.270> can

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
now that's not a good one but you can

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.190 
now that's not a good one but you can
see<00:04:43.180> I'm<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.570> zoom<00:04:44.600> in<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.050> little<00:04:45.139> bit

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
see I'm if you zoom in a little bit

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.890 
see I'm if you zoom in a little bit
detail<00:04:49.030> all<00:04:50.030> right<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.870> take<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.380> cone<00:04:51.620> and

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
detail all right now I take the cone and

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.030 
detail all right now I take the cone and
I<00:04:53.900> might<00:04:54.139> rub<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.710> comb<00:04:56.260> on<00:04:57.260> my<00:04:57.440> forehead<00:04:57.740> to

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
I might rub the comb on my forehead to

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.290 
I might rub the comb on my forehead to
keep<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.400> from<00:04:58.930> sticking<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.639> clay<00:05:01.940> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
keep it from sticking to the clay and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.290 
keep it from sticking to the clay and
then<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:02.570> just<00:05:03.160> lightly<00:05:04.160> roll<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.760> clay<00:05:05.000> back

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
then I just lightly roll the clay back

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.159 
then I just lightly roll the clay back
and<00:05:05.510> forth<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.890> you<00:05:06.919> can<00:05:07.820> see<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.360> forms

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
and forth and you can see that it forms

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.850 
and forth and you can see that it forms
a<00:05:09.289> kind<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.650> bead<00:05:10.150> type<00:05:11.150> pattern<00:05:11.479> there<00:05:11.870> it

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
a kind of a bead type pattern there it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.909 
a kind of a bead type pattern there it
is<00:05:13.760> uneven<00:05:14.270> that's<00:05:14.450> why<00:05:14.600> it's<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:14.990> shows<00:05:15.650> there

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
is uneven that's why it's a shows there

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.830 
is uneven that's why it's a shows there
and<00:05:16.100> they're<00:05:16.250> there<00:05:16.700> but<00:05:17.300> that's<00:05:17.479> okay<00:05:17.810> I

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
and they're there but that's okay I

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.469 
and they're there but that's okay I
don't<00:05:18.229> want<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.590> be<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.700> want<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.360> look

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
don't want it to be I want to look

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.150 
don't want it to be I want to look
sculptural<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.140> don't<00:05:21.320> want<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.560> look<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.860> a

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
sculptural I don't want to look like a

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.430 
sculptural I don't want to look like a
perfect<00:05:22.880> set<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.180> beads<00:05:23.360> i<00:05:23.660> can<00:05:23.990> go<00:05:24.229> in<00:05:24.410> here

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
perfect set of beads i can go in here
