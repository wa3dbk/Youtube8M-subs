00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello there is drugs for you today 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.440
 show purely such minecraft 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.070
 sports fashion where the author tried and 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 added 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.890
 8 baseball bats are so different 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 forces are all differently craft but 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.760
 for some reason 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.519
 for some reason he hasn't added one 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.939
 baseball probably forgot 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.230
 add the ball is painful but what am I 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.290
 found a way how we check these bits we 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 we will check them on the rings so well 1 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.960
 it lives in us wooden it is crafted 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.829
 leather and oak boards in general, these 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.010
 three follow exactly the same way 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:55.500
 crafting well let's go out now 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:59.310
 out and try them 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.650
 so here I do not know here is not added for some reason 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300
 he balls ok here's a chicken like 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.000
 a bit like a baseball ball eg 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.040
 also white too round well relatively 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.110
 and here if we beat wooden bits this 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.760
 chicken here and so little flies and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.540
 it removes 2p plus some hepe for 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.270
 for the fall here we put it again and again 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 once hit from rehab here and here it is 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 so here gradually falls following 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.330
 Kraft bits of iron is exactly the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.130
 same way crafted here is iron 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.280
 gold and diamond that's when we kill her 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 chicken she takes off a lot further and u 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.259
 her four cops are taken away well gold 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 she adds no along the chicken too 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.140
 weak for this let's take let's say 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.410
 svinozombi yes but almost the same 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.659
 chicken only back here we take 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.049
 svinozombi way oh you little 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.930
 svinozombi okay and hit svinozombi 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.860
 and from there it's far vata flies 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.519
 just try to hit him as much wow 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.170
 shorter somewhere you fly far away there 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.510
 So 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 here he landed and now we take 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.239
 we hit the diamond bat and she 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.849
 he is far away and he is grandmothers and 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:32.390
 falls so need me in life to fill up 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:35.540
 where you can see everything but it has already fallen so still 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.650
 one let's take a look at 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.050
 very kind of broads excellent but it is in general 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.090
 such simple bits were that without 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.459
 any effects 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.180
 Well, they are just awesome pushes 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.660
 just the steeper the bit the farther it is 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.299
 pushes the mob 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.580
 and here it is already going to cool bits 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.390
 who craft differently this here 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.890
 little green 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.150
 It is crafted from two rod ifrit 4 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.630
 gunpowder and 1 skin and she does the next 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.920
 Effect 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.260
 come on she throws moba like that and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.720
 blows up right below it but it's already 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.060
 just epic real epic first 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.239
 let us once more in a take it 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.120
 so let's jump and gunpowder explodes under 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.299
 him but it's just a combo then next 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.430
 bit she is dynamite gene avaya she 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.709
 crafted from two dynamites 1 leather 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.359
 but she's not so epic she immediately 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.239
 explodes we break 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.070
 also we also take damage now I 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.560
 I'll probably put it on myself 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.110
 mail armor 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.220
 Well, then I do not want a helmet chain mail wish 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.250
 iron iron is more beautiful here 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.250
 and 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.870
 here so we hit the article there is no why 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.830
 then the damage was not received at the time like 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.480
 got but that okay it doesn't matter here 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.190
 let's take the pigs again 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.200
 and now the next one is my favorite 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.320
 it is electric and a bit which 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.930
 crafted from two iron bars and 4 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.310
 luminous dust and 1 skin and when we 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.380
 we hit a piggyback so here now I 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.420
 but do you have to put on zombies when we 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.840
 hitting a piggyback makes this 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.270
 Effect 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.940
 he takes off and lightning hits him 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.550
 just just just a great view 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.010
 come again so here is a woman c him 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.850
 and you are looking for you well, well, just 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.340
 awesome 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.680
 why do n't you want something else ? 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.040
 here and that these are just and so well and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.800
 the last bit that I did not quite understand 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.870
 how does it work this is such a carrot be 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.350
 the sad looks a little like that 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.530
 sneak in this way 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.210
 we take a piggyback move here in this 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:07.110
 mode eat carrot it and see we 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:11.610
 for some reason we take off and sit astride 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.730
 this piggyback is not even necessary 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.550
 svinozombi just on any enemy by the way 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:22.620
 On chicken, too, can until the end they now 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.590
 try to taste there you see with us 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.170
 see here etc. 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.450
 sheep and ours which I donâ€™t know 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.140
 it's useless some kind of it really well 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.350
 not that useless 0 but incomprehensible in 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.360
 In general, here are the bits and on this from 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.180
 yourself guys run out of here 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.270
 sports bot limp bits sorry 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.370
 of course that we did not have weak-willed 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.920
 ball but for some reason it seems to me that 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.560
 the author for some reason did not even want him 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.970
 I do n't know why, in general, all the guys 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.680
