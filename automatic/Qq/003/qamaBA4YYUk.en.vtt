also of kickboxing Junior dos Santos

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.670 
also of kickboxing Junior dos Santos
could<00:04:39.210> come<00:04:39.389> on<00:04:39.570> over<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:39.990> kick<00:04:40.169> boxing<00:04:40.500> if<00:04:40.590> he

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
could come on over and kick boxing if he

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.430 
could come on over and kick boxing if he
wanted<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:41.070> as<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> pure<00:04:41.460> boxer<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:43.320> know

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
wanted to as a pure boxer but you know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.440 
wanted to as a pure boxer but you know
unless<00:04:44.010> he<00:04:44.220> can<00:04:44.370> fight<00:04:44.550> at<00:04:44.669> his<00:04:44.790> range<00:04:45.090> which

unless he can fight at his range which

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.210 
unless he can fight at his range which
usually<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:46.290> know<00:04:46.410> boxers<00:04:46.919> would<00:04:47.100> have

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
usually you know boxers would have

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.400 
usually you know boxers would have
trouble<00:04:47.460> doing<00:04:47.730> if<00:04:48.030> you're<00:04:48.419> a<00:04:48.450> pure<00:04:48.720> boxer<00:04:49.230> and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
trouble doing if you're a pure boxer and

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.590 
trouble doing if you're a pure boxer and
you<00:04:49.650> go<00:04:49.800> into<00:04:49.830> kickboxing<00:04:50.330> probably<00:04:51.330> get<00:04:51.480> your

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
you go into kickboxing probably get your

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.900 
you go into kickboxing probably get your
ass<00:04:51.720> kicked<00:04:52.020> that's<00:04:52.230> all<00:04:52.380> there<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.910> so

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
ass kicked that's all there is to it so

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.020 
ass kicked that's all there is to it so
because<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.050> JDS<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.130> chances<00:04:56.580> here<00:04:56.820> are

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
because of that JDS is chances here are
