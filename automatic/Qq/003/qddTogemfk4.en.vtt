00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
dirty but to me the solution to that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.410 
dirty but to me the solution to that
problem<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.849> have<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.329> those

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
problem is to have one of those

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.750 
problem is to have one of those
suspenders<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.560> pull<00:02:28.859> down<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.159> table

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
suspenders that you pull down the table

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.459 
suspenders that you pull down the table
and<00:02:29.909> then<00:02:30.389> it<00:02:30.569> sort<00:02:30.719> of<00:02:30.840> automatically

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
and then it sort of automatically

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.349 
and then it sort of automatically
detaches<00:02:32.189> itself<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.849> force<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
detaches itself from the force and

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.569 
detaches itself from the force and
you're<00:02:33.540> using<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.139> way<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.980> only<00:02:35.189> thing

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579
