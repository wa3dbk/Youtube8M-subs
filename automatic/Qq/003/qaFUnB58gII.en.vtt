for a while it's got like you know it's

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.460 
for a while it's got like you know it's
skins<00:01:51.940> kind<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.300> wore<00:01:52.510> off<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.050> body<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
skins kind of wore off on the body and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.710 
skins kind of wore off on the body and
it's<00:01:53.980> very<00:01:54.160> skeleton<00:01:54.790> like<00:01:54.940> now<00:01:55.180> kind<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.480> skin

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
it's very skeleton like now kind of skin

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.970 
it's very skeleton like now kind of skin
and<00:01:55.840> bones<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.200> looks<00:01:56.380> like<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.680> been<00:01:56.830> here

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
and bones it looks like it's been here

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.100 
and bones it looks like it's been here
definitely<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> while<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.900> tape

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
definitely for a while and the tape

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.380 
definitely for a while and the tape
recorder<00:01:59.590> has<00:01:59.770> riches<00:02:00.100> majestic<00:02:00.820> on<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.180> I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
recorder has riches majestic on it so I

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.690 
recorder has riches majestic on it so I
believe<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.200> even<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.710> ending<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
believe this is even the ending to the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.370 
believe this is even the ending to the
murder<00:02:03.880> mystery<00:02:04.420> or<00:02:04.570> it's<00:02:04.930> definitely

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
murder mystery or it's definitely

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.690 
murder mystery or it's definitely
something<00:02:05.590> huge<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.070> do<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.520> murder

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
something huge to do with the murder

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.669 
something huge to do with the murder
mystery<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.690> definitely<00:02:08.110> ties<00:02:08.379> into

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
mystery and that definitely ties into

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.080 
mystery and that definitely ties into
Richard's<00:02:09.069> majestic<00:02:09.550> I'm<00:02:09.670> not<00:02:09.789> entirely<00:02:09.970> sure

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
this definitely does have something to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.970 
this definitely does have something to
do<00:02:13.510> with<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.770> mineshaft

well down here I'm not entirely sure
what<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.100> designed<00:02:18.460> it'll<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.880> into<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
what I was designed it'll go into a
