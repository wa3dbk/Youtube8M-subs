00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.280 

from<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.589> very<00:00:01.680> beginning<00:00:02.360> the<00:00:03.360> ipad<00:00:04.110> was

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
from the very beginning the ipad was

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.470 
from the very beginning the ipad was
designed<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.980> be<00:00:05.190> very<00:00:05.270> powerful<00:00:06.270> very

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.700 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:07.370> but<00:00:08.370> also<00:00:09.080> remarkably<00:00:10.080> simple<00:00:10.410> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.499 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> our<00:00:13.860> goal<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
use so our goal was to take all the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660 
use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:15.900> things<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.970 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:18.119> iPad<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:19.199> pack<00:00:19.500> them<00:00:19.710> into<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.450 
full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.150> much<00:00:21.420> smaller<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.820> did<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:24.990> ipad

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

mini one of the things that makes iPad
so<00:00:28.800> incredible<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.849> there's<00:00:30.510> almost<00:00:30.689> no

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
so incredible is that there's almost no

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.510 

before<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.530> had<00:01:37.590> done<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.130> take<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
before that we had done was take the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.539 
before that we had done was take the
original<00:01:38.969> iPad<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.869> reduce<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.549> all

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
original iPad and just reduce it all

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.389 
original iPad and just reduce it all
that<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.939> would<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.240> aware<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:42.740> was<00:01:43.740> was

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that you would be aware of was was

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
that you would be aware of was was
everything<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.270> missing<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
everything that was just missing that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.730 
everything that was just missing that
there<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.530> inherent<00:01:46.740> loss<00:01:47.429> in<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.810> reducing

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
there is inherent loss in just reducing

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.600 
there is inherent loss in just reducing
a<00:01:49.799> product<00:01:50.189> inside<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.319> did<00:01:52.679> was<00:01:53.579> we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a product inside on what we did was we

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.279 
a product inside on what we did was we
went<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> very<00:01:54.360> beginning<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.020> we

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
went back to the very beginning and we

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.770 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.709> time<00:01:56.069> to<00:01:56.670> design<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> product<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
took the time to design a product that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.310> concentration<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.459> not<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> reduction

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.459 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.959> original<00:02:02.270> we<00:02:03.270> felt<00:02:03.569> strongly<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:05.280> point<00:02:05.549> nine<00:02:05.610> inches<00:02:06.179> was<00:02:06.869> exactly<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.550 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:07.740> display<00:02:08.220> size<00:02:08.630> but<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.720> became<00:02:10.049> clear

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.430> had<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> reduce<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.269> width<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
that we had to reduce the width of the
borders<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.610> still<00:02:14.910> pick<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.329> up<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
borders so you can still pick it up and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.940

easily<00:02:16.079> use<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.769> hand<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.920> have
