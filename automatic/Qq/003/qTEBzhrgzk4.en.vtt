and then
so<00:01:03.309> we<00:01:03.520> will<00:01:03.610> start<00:01:03.850> go<00:01:04.120> down<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.390> them<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.720> them

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.040 

can't<00:01:19.850> really<00:01:19.970> see<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.390> very<00:01:20.510> well<00:01:20.660> right<00:01:21.020> now

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
can't really see it very well right now

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.970 
can't really see it very well right now
but<00:01:23.110> there<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.200> goes<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:27.290> don't<00:01:27.650> want<00:01:27.860> to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060
