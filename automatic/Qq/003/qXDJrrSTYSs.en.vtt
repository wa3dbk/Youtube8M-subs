00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.219
 winrar file they open it of course and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.360
 they extract it where you want 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.360
 in my case on the desk 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.400
 as I had it lowered since it has been 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 replaced 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.080

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.340
 they give ok to everything and next to everything in my 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.550
 case I will not give it because I already have it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.450
 installed well once it is installed 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.950
 they go to crack 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.920
 and they copy it 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.619
