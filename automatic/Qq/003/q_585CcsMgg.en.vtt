mind

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
mind

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.819 
mind
I<00:02:59.459> mean<00:02:59.700> Yamaha<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> good<00:03:00.420> bike<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.959> that's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
I mean Yamaha is a good bike and that's

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.620 
I mean Yamaha is a good bike and that's
why<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.220> chose<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.639> stay<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> AMA<00:03:03.329> even

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
why we chose to stay with the AMA even

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.970 
why we chose to stay with the AMA even
though<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.840> didn't<00:03:04.019> get<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.200> Yamaha<00:03:04.530> support

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
though we didn't get the Yamaha support

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.069 
though we didn't get the Yamaha support

myself I can do good and then switching

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.670 
myself I can do good and then switching
up<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.700> program<00:03:15.090> too<00:03:15.299> much<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.560> know<00:03:16.650> I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
up the program too much and you know I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.930 
up the program too much and you know I
haven't<00:03:16.950> having<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> failure

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.240 

yeah<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.239> mean<00:03:23.480> pretty<00:03:23.780> much<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.500> lot<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
pocket so it's more like the team

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.750 
pocket so it's more like the team
succeeds<00:03:29.090> I've<00:03:29.300> succeeded<00:03:29.980> or<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.160> mean<00:03:31.610> it
