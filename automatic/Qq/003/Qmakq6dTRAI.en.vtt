science<00:04:11.129> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.310> religion<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:13.500> what<00:04:14.010> I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
science this is religion and what I

science this is religion and what I
suspect<00:04:14.909> is<00:04:15.060> happening<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.629> this<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:16.049> live<00:04:16.289> in

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
suspect is happening is this we live in

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.010 
suspect is happening is this we live in
a<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.919> very<00:04:17.190> unsettled<00:04:18.000> times

a in very unsettled times

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.840 
a in very unsettled times
it<00:04:20.020> used<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.350> be<00:04:20.470> possible<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.100> believe<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.700> a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
it used to be possible to believe in a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.500 
it used to be possible to believe in a
personal<00:04:22.980> benevolent<00:04:23.980> powerful<00:04:24.850> all-knowing

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
personal benevolent powerful all-knowing

God who cared individuals who you could

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.020 
God who cared individuals who you could
pray<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.650> but<00:04:29.650> now<00:04:29.800> there's<00:04:30.310> very<00:04:30.550> few<00:04:30.610> people

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
pray to but now there's very few people

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.890 
pray to but now there's very few people
who<00:04:31.180> really<00:04:31.210> believe<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.290> think<00:04:33.900> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
who really believe that I think the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.560 
who really believe that I think the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
science for we were ill has destroyed a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.430 
science for we were ill has destroyed a
lot<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> traditional<00:04:38.650> theologies<00:04:39.370> and

lot of the traditional theologies and

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.630 
lot of the traditional theologies and
yet<00:04:41.440> people<00:04:41.740> have<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:41.980> same<00:04:42.190> needs<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
yet people have the same needs to

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.770 
yet people have the same needs to
believe<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.030> they<00:04:43.150> always<00:04:43.390> did<00:04:43.570> perhaps

believe that they always did perhaps

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.540 
believe that they always did perhaps
more<00:04:44.140> so<00:04:44.320> because<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.830> times<00:04:45.040> we<00:04:45.220> live<00:04:45.370> in

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
more so because the times we live in

more so because the times we live in
well<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.600> Flying<00:04:46.840> Saucer<00:04:46.960> myths<00:04:47.500> are<00:04:47.770> a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
well the Flying Saucer myths are a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.360 
well the Flying Saucer myths are a
really<00:04:49.090> clever<00:04:49.330> compromise<00:04:49.990> it's<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:51.010> way<00:04:51.190> of

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
really clever compromise it's a way of

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.400 
really clever compromise it's a way of
having<00:04:51.610> beings<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.570> come<00:04:52.750> from<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.080> sky

that are going to step in and prevent us

very well might and yet have it in the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.240 
very well might and yet have it in the
cloak<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.630> science<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.650> no<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:05.920> can<00:05:06.040> say

cloak of science so that no one can say

cloak of science so that no one can say
nonsense<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.330> doesn't<00:05:07.660> match<00:05:07.810> science<00:05:08.260> it's

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
nonsense that doesn't match science it's

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.540 
nonsense that doesn't match science it's
all<00:05:08.620> very<00:05:09.100> pseudo<00:05:09.730> scientific<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:11.370> would<00:05:12.370> think

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
all very pseudo scientific I would think

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.960 
all very pseudo scientific I would think
that<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:14.170> at<00:05:14.380> least<00:05:14.560> for<00:05:15.040> the<00:05:15.310> contact<00:05:15.760> myths

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
that that at least for the contact myths

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.450 
that that at least for the contact myths
and<00:05:16.210> probably<00:05:16.540> for<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.780> lot<00:05:16.930> of<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.370> events<00:05:18.370> of

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
and probably for a lot of the events of

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.590 
and probably for a lot of the events of
people<00:05:18.730> who<00:05:18.820> just<00:05:18.940> see<00:05:19.150> things<00:05:19.360> and

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
people who just see things and

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.980 
people who just see things and
understand<00:05:19.990> flying<00:05:20.290> overhead<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:22.690> what's

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
understand flying overhead that what's

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.910 
understand flying overhead that what's
involved<00:05:24.060> psychology<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.270> theology<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.500> not

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
involved psychology and theology and not

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.630 
involved psychology and theology and not
so<00:05:27.100> much<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.460> physical<00:05:27.640> sciences<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:30.070> as<00:05:30.490> we

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
so much the physical sciences so as we

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.670 
so much the physical sciences so as we
have<00:05:30.760> seen<00:05:31.000> scientists<00:05:31.960> think<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.380> evidence

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
have seen scientists think the evidence

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.920 
have seen scientists think the evidence
is<00:05:33.010> mounting<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.520> life<00:05:34.000> in<00:05:34.270> some<00:05:34.570> form
