here<00:00:10.070> we<00:00:10.190> are<00:00:10.400> taking<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:11.030> look<00:00:11.270> at<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:11.600> hydro

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
here we are taking a look at the hydro

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.320 
here we are taking a look at the hydro

control system all-in-one device got a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.710 
control system all-in-one device got a

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
map math adjuster on the left hand side

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.310 
map math adjuster on the left hand side
on<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.590> right<00:00:21.710> hand<00:00:21.920> side<00:00:22.070> it's<00:00:22.550> got<00:00:22.760> an<00:00:22.880> 02

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
on the right hand side it's got an 02

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.630 
on the right hand side it's got an 02
adjustments<00:00:24.320> they<00:00:24.440> can<00:00:24.650> actually<00:00:25.220> add

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
adjustments they can actually add

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.180 
adjustments they can actually add
voltage<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.360> 02<00:00:26.690> side<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:27.950> that<00:00:28.100> what

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
voltage to the 02 side so that what

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.620 
voltage to the 02 side so that what
you're<00:00:28.310> adding<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.700> hydrogen<00:00:29.120> you<00:00:29.360> know<00:00:29.420> to

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
you're adding that hydrogen you know to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.480 
you're adding that hydrogen you know to
sensor<00:00:29.960> doesn't<00:00:30.140> sense<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.590> whole<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.370> know

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
sensor doesn't sense the whole you know

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.400 
sensor doesn't sense the whole you know
totally<00:00:32.090> lean<00:00:32.300> environment<00:00:33.079> as<00:00:33.230> your

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
totally lean environment as your

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.529 
totally lean environment as your
computer<00:00:33.710> starts<00:00:33.860> dumping<00:00:34.129> fuel<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.239> can

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
computer starts dumping fuel so you can

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.940 
computer starts dumping fuel so you can
see<00:00:35.690> we've<00:00:35.840> actually<00:00:36.020> got<00:00:36.289> this<00:00:36.440> hooked<00:00:36.590> up<00:00:36.800> as

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
see we've actually got this hooked up as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.950 
see we've actually got this hooked up as
a<00:00:37.010> multimeter<00:00:37.340> down<00:00:37.700> here<00:00:37.970> you<00:00:38.570> can<00:00:38.720> see<00:00:38.840> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
a multimeter down here you can see the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.319 
a multimeter down here you can see the
device<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.860> actually<00:00:40.160> putting<00:00:40.579> out<00:00:40.820> voltage

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
device is actually putting out voltage

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.540 
device is actually putting out voltage
which<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:42.380> you're<00:00:42.530> even<00:00:42.739> here<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.130> little

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
which so you're even here is a little

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.770 
which so you're even here is a little
bit<00:00:43.700> higher<00:00:43.880> than<00:00:43.910> what<00:00:44.270> comes<00:00:44.480> out<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:44.750> other

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
bit higher than what comes out the other

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.330 
bit higher than what comes out the other
side<00:00:44.930> going<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.040> GPU<00:00:47.710> this<00:00:48.710> works<00:00:48.920> on<00:00:49.130> most

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
side going to the GPU this works on most

reliable<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.370> can<00:01:01.520> see

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.920 

I'm<00:01:07.509> actually<00:01:07.750> going<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.140> adjust<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.590> map<00:01:09.009> map

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I'm actually going to adjust the map map

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.999 
I'm actually going to adjust the map map

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
leaning the truck out now where it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.990

any gasoline get into this truck at all
now<00:01:42.149> now<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.950> see<00:01:48.189> as<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.240> bring<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.630> knob

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
now now you can see as I bring the knob

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.100 
now now you can see as I bring the knob
back<00:01:50.140> down<00:01:52.830> should<00:01:53.830> be<00:01:53.979> able<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.340> hear<00:01:55.110> engine

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
back down should be able to hear engine

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.100 
back down should be able to hear engine
smoothing<00:01:56.530> out<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.599> my<00:01:58.750> ideal

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
smoothing out set it to my ideal

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.190 
smoothing out set it to my ideal
position<00:01:59.289> here<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.759> on<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.030> 02<00:02:04.179> side<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:05.049> can

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
position here and on the 02 side you can

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.749 
position here and on the 02 side you can
see<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.530> we're<00:02:05.649> still<00:02:05.829> maintaining<00:02:06.280> voltage

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
see that we're still maintaining voltage

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.990 
see that we're still maintaining voltage
bouncing<00:02:07.630> out<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> o2<00:02:09.039> sensor<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
bouncing out going to the o2 sensor and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.059 
bouncing out going to the o2 sensor and
that<00:02:10.119> voltage<00:02:10.329> is<00:02:10.840> an<00:02:11.170> oscillating<00:02:11.650> voltage

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
that voltage is an oscillating voltage

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.740 
that voltage is an oscillating voltage
it<00:02:12.190> goes<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.700> down<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.090> see<00:02:13.299> it<00:02:13.420> jump<00:02:13.630> in

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
it goes up and down you see it jump in

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.840 
it goes up and down you see it jump in
there<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.410> reason<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.769> jumps<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.609> and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
there the reason it jumps like that and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
there the reason it jumps like that and
so<00:02:15.970> you're<00:02:16.150> if<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.109> doesn't<00:02:17.500> think<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.859> it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
so you're if you doesn't think that it's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.580 
so you're if you doesn't think that it's
constantly<00:02:18.970> getting<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.329> constant<00:02:19.780> voltage<00:02:19.900> we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
constantly getting a constant voltage we

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.050 
constantly getting a constant voltage we
just<00:02:20.769> want<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> add<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.489> bit<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.700> voltage

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
just want to add a little bit of voltage

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.120 
just want to add a little bit of voltage
to<00:02:22.239> what<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.569> o2<00:02:23.019> sensor<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.680> already<00:02:23.950> sitting

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
to what the o2 sensor is already sitting

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.190 
to what the o2 sensor is already sitting
out<00:02:24.510> yeah<00:02:26.100> that's<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.600> that's<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.840> hydro

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
out yeah that's it that's the hydro

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.440 
out yeah that's it that's the hydro
commander<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.940> what<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.269> need<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
commander that's what you need to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.849 
commander that's what you need to
control<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.959> front<00:02:32.200> side<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.470> backside

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
control the front side and backside
