00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.569
 that who youtube people have to 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.290
 buy a gamer what is a new 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.309
 video that just what would be three 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.609
 methods to download everything for free 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.589
 everything for free and well, I do it for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.429
 Thankful for your I feel I think 130 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.079
 subscribers 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:28.689
 I do not know how we got to them and I think 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.329
 that with them is good 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.670
 thank you very much so they won it and 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:39.700
 well one thing is that the last one 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.590
 I will teach the best method that goes 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.150
 to serve many because they are 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.380
 original iphone ipad ipod accounts or 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.740
 is itunes and all that and good 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.710
 he's just the one in my first video 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.120
 that is minecraft because said he 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 how good is not going to the safari search 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 billiards 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.670
 Look for them and they will appear 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.100
 application leads to a page that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.410
 call to catch and then it will appear 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.300
 to download it and presenting it to 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.820
 search provoke and download 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.190
 height because for the high broken 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 it meant that they are the ones busy jai 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.010
 prakash or is it downloaded but only 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 if they are jailbreak users but if not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.640
 you are jailbreak user you need to put 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.220
 where it appears download a high broker 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.340
 which means that it is not necessary to have 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.870
 jailbreak so you can see here simply 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 they will not seem to install 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.960
 and they tighten it to install because I do not 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.040
 I'm going to do it because I just 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 I find it very bad because it influences the 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.520
 application takes a long time to load in 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.160
 several things and if I do not like it I do not 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.910
 like and that's why you can download 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.060
 all free yes but that does not mean 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.770
 that will serve you because in itself 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.960
 applications after like a week 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.780
 they close you and I find that very 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.140
 bad so good now we're going to the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.840
 second that is called the manager and good 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.960
 This is one of the best 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.310
 semi pirate applications that I prefer 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.750
 with semi pirates that are unloaded from 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.800
 iTunes and good from the author good as you see 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.560
 here the application is very complete and I 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.319
 I find it very very good because good 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.630
 the search engine takes its little time 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.540
 compared to the others do not close 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 the applications after a while and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.750
 good if one looks for is not understood master 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.490
 0 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.250
 and then they appear in a while and 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.800
 it seems that he has not sought defense 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.310
 let's look for legos 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.600
 benach in charge super fast and good nothing 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.000
 more squeeze one of those who want and 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.360
 just download it and well that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.730
 it's very easy because they only see it squeeze and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.980
 in that small button where a 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 arrow down and it's going to start 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.050
 download and then value is not done 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.870
 take everything is like that but good less than 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.350
 in visuals because if the applications 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.460
 with a lot too much 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.310
 space takes too much too much longer 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.210
 sometimes it is canceled and well this 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.610
 also happens in this but let's say that 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.110
 you can go back because it pauses 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.700
 it even closes pauses so 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.010
 well that serves equally high 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.480
 because in the end you just have to install 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.000
 ready 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.850
 well now we go to the last one that is 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.140
 on Facebook 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.140
 and good 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.710
 let's go fast here because in itself 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.710
 I want to allocate 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.130
 God 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.040
 good everything fair with little internet 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.540
 so good now we're going to what 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.190
 it would be this 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.250
 and sorry 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.060
 we go to the page that I want them 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.810
 to show 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.810
 seriously 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.820
 the list 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.130
 good in the community is not a 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.040
 application is called iphoneros community 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.140
 it's about you not being given accounts 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.150
 they give you ways to download everything for free 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.190
 I find it fantastic because you can 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.140
 really do it so good is short 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.420
 because now I have to go and everything like that 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.980
 that a giant greeting and here you can 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.560
 find real accounts if you can 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.780
