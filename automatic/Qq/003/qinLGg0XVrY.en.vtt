keep it from burning my recipe makes it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
keep it from burning my recipe makes it
very<00:00:42.600> easy<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.469> roasting<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.160> basin<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
very easy by roasting the basin in the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.779 
very easy by roasting the basin in the
microwave<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.780> am<00:00:46.020> using<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.860> kinds<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> besan

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
microwave I am using two kinds of besan

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
microwave I am using two kinds of besan
one<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.809> regular<00:00:49.289> grind<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> feels

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
one which is regular grind and feels

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.299 
one which is regular grind and feels
just<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.789> flour<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.110> other<00:00:52.350> which<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just like flour and the other which is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.510 
just like flour and the other which is
coarsely<00:00:54.059> ground<00:00:54.390> called<00:00:54.780> ladoo<00:00:55.320> Basin<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
coarsely ground called ladoo Basin the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.029 
coarsely ground called ladoo Basin the
right<00:00:56.760> combination<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.809> both<00:00:58.289> these<00:00:58.500> basins

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
right combination of both these basins

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
right combination of both these basins
keeps<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> ladoo<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.480> being<00:01:00.690> too<00:01:00.930> pasty<00:01:01.230> or

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
keeps the ladoo from being too pasty or

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:14.080 
keeps the ladoo from being too pasty or
too<00:01:01.949> gritty<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> ingredients

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
too gritty so I have all the ingredients

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
too gritty so I have all the ingredients

besan ladoo Basin sugar butter almonds

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.120 
besan ladoo Basin sugar butter almonds
which<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.280> toasted<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> microwave<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
which i toasted in the microwave and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
which i toasted in the microwave and
coarsely<00:01:23.130> chopped<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.770> cardamom

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
coarsely chopped them and cardamom

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.819 
coarsely chopped them and cardamom
powder<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.960> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> melt<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> butter<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
powder I'm going to melt the butter in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
powder I'm going to melt the butter in
the<00:01:28.860> microwave<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.549> HIGH<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.210> cook<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> for

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the microwave on HIGH and cook it for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
the microwave on HIGH and cook it for
about<00:01:31.320> 2<00:01:31.740> minutes<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
about 2 minutes so that some of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
about 2 minutes so that some of the
steam<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.780> evaporate<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> butter<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
steam can evaporate so the butter is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
steam can evaporate so the butter is
melted<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.880> bubbling<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
melted in bubbling and now I'm going to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
melted in bubbling and now I'm going to
add<00:01:40.200> both<00:01:40.860> flours<00:01:42.380> mix<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.299> put<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
add both flours mix it in and put it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
add both flours mix it in and put it
back<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> microwave<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.799> HIGH<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.729> one

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
back in the microwave on HIGH for one

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
back in the microwave on HIGH for one
and<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> half<00:01:48.509> minutes<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.680> after<00:01:49.890> toasting<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and a half minutes so after toasting it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
and a half minutes so after toasting it
for<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> half<00:01:51.149> minutes<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> stirred<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
for one and a half minutes I stirred it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
for one and a half minutes I stirred it
and<00:01:52.829> put<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> microwave<00:01:54.000> for

and put it back in the microwave for
another<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> half<00:01:56.250> minutes<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
another one and a half minutes and this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.030 
another one and a half minutes and this
