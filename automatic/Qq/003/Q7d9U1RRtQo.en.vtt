00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:11.940
Crime and punishment borne. I want to be loved

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:33.840
Mama’s candies are so sweet, I have no choice to put that poison on my tongue

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.600
I saw in a dream black tea, jam and two spoons. It’s useless, it’s not right

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.420
The ark already flew away. I sneer at the moon

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.060
So lovely, your eyes

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.360
Dissolving, boiling in my sleep

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.940
Mister Oni, come, come, here

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.140
Follow the clap, the hand’s clap

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.840
Your lovely smile

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.460
I’ll crush it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.040
I’ll destroy it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.000
In small pieces

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.020
As I’ll whisper this curse “I won’t leave you”

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:37.420
If I could’ve eaten this apple tart, what there would’ve been next? After you

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:47.400
How many dreams I saw? I’m tired of your smile. Someone saw through my scars

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:56.200
Always, forever, it will keep repeating, this secret play

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.860
I broke this secret flower garden and pushed my way at the bottom where things are tied tightly to my heart with an empty chain

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:16.800
As I escape the hell’s needles mountain, running around as if I’m barefooted, I shed bloody tears, realizing that is my punishment

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.660
I can’t do nothing but to desire one only person, just “you”

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.600
I search through my crimes piled up, yet even today is dyed in red

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.280
Your lovely smile

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.940
I’ll crush it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.580
I’ll destroy it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.580
In small pieces

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.560
As I’ll whisper this curse “I won’t leave you”
