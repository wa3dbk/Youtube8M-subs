00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
like I think that was suggesting in 343

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.950 
like I think that was suggesting in 343
listen<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:57.730> everything<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.570> was<00:01:58.690> pretty<00:01:58.810> good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
listen so everything I was pretty good

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.270 
listen so everything I was pretty good
okay<00:01:59.290> was<00:01:59.440> pretty<00:01:59.710> good<00:01:59.800> for<00:01:59.860> them<00:02:00.070> to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
okay was pretty good for them to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.870 
okay was pretty good for them to
actually<00:02:01.000> add<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.560> golden<00:02:02.980> wok<00:02:03.340> because<00:02:03.460> it

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
actually add the golden wok because it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.900 
actually add the golden wok because it
looks<00:02:04.240> like<00:02:04.420> really<00:02:04.810> cool<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.760> dry<00:02:06.760> I

looks like really cool and just dry I

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.120 
looks like really cool and just dry I
think<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.150> drives<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.479> lot<00:02:07.600> faster<00:02:08.080> I'm<00:02:09.009> not

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
think it drives a lot faster I'm not

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.160 
think it drives a lot faster I'm not
really<00:02:09.310> sure<00:02:09.429> let's<00:02:10.030> move<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.450> weapons<00:02:10.990> now

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
infected energy sword it's called the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.620 
infected energy sword it's called the
infected<00:02:21.190> anything<00:02:21.459> sure<00:02:21.610> because<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.360> like

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
infected anything sure because it's like

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.080 
infected anything sure because it's like
it's<00:02:22.900> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> be<00:02:23.320> used<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:24.520> games<00:02:24.910> of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
it's going to be used for like games of

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.480 
it's going to be used for like games of
infection<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> infected<00:02:26.350> will<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.650> read

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
infection to the infected will have read

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.280 
infection to the infected will have read
ng<00:02:27.820> swords<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.330> imagine<00:02:28.990> they'll<00:02:29.080> make<00:02:29.260> it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
ng swords I imagine they'll make it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770 
ng swords I imagine they'll make it
easier<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.770> see<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:31.330> games<00:02:31.630> like

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
easier to see because like in games like

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.440 
easier to see because like in games like
Halo<00:02:32.050> 3<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.470> hard<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.730> infected<00:02:34.300> and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
Halo 3 was hard to see the infected and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.750 
Halo 3 was hard to see the infected and
