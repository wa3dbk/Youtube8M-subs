makes the stretch today so generally a

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.030 
makes the stretch today so generally a
lot<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.850> lower<00:00:40.030> back<00:00:40.329> pain<00:00:40.390> does<00:00:41.140> occur<00:00:41.470> from

lot of lower back pain does occur from

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.080 
lot of lower back pain does occur from
having<00:00:42.430> tight<00:00:42.760> source<00:00:43.420> which<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.070> muscle

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
having tight source which is the muscle

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180 
having tight source which is the muscle
which<00:00:46.090> is<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.780> muscle<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:47.260> attaches<00:00:47.470> from<00:00:47.860> you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
which is a muscle that attaches from you

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.580 
which is a muscle that attaches from you
keep<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.579> go<00:00:48.730> through<00:00:49.030> your<00:00:49.300> torso<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:50.020> pull

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
keep it go through your torso and pull

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.800 
keep it go through your torso and pull
the<00:00:50.770> knee<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:50.950> ask<00:00:51.130> for<00:00:51.430> vertebrae<00:00:52.060> so<00:00:52.660> it's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
the knee and ask for vertebrae so it's

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.970 
the knee and ask for vertebrae so it's
really<00:00:52.989> important<00:00:53.470> to<00:00:53.500> stretch<00:00:53.800> these

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
really important to stretch these

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.860 
really important to stretch these
muscles<00:00:54.040> out<00:00:54.700> particularly<00:00:55.300> if<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:55.600> sit<00:00:55.840> down

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
muscles out particularly if you sit down

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.010 
muscles out particularly if you sit down
a<00:00:56.170> lot<00:00:56.590> during<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.700> day<00:00:57.940> they<00:00:58.210> will<00:00:58.450> shorten

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
a lot during the day they will shorten

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.530 
a lot during the day they will shorten
and<00:00:59.320> get<00:00:59.500> nice<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.739> tight<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.820> you<00:01:00.880> do<00:01:01.210> want<00:01:01.480> to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
and get nice and tight so you do want to

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.049 
and get nice and tight so you do want to
learn<00:01:01.870> quickly<00:01:02.200> if<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.219> can<00:01:03.460> do<00:01:03.670> this<00:01:03.820> stretch

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
sure that that means strength you can

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.250 
sure that that means strength you can

get up both hands are on the inside of
your<00:01:26.560> foot<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.979> then<00:01:27.580> you're<00:01:27.729> just<00:01:27.820> gonna

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
your foot and then you're just gonna

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.859 
your foot and then you're just gonna
draw<00:01:28.360> very<00:01:28.900> very<00:01:29.470> small<00:01:29.979> circles<00:01:30.850> through<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
draw very very small circles through the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.460 
draw very very small circles through the
front<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.530> hip<00:01:32.950> -<00:01:33.430> like<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.820> straight

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
front of this hip - like that straight

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.170 
front of this hip - like that straight
now<00:01:35.470> they're<00:01:35.680> so<00:01:35.979> small<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.880> could

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
now they're so small that you could

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.020 
now they're so small that you could
probably<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:38.470> somebody's<00:01:38.890> watching<00:01:39.159> me<00:01:39.490> it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
probably if somebody's watching me it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.370 
probably if somebody's watching me it
doesn't<00:01:40.360> really<00:01:40.510> look<00:01:40.750> like<00:01:40.960> you're<00:01:41.140> doing

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
doesn't really look like you're doing

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.500 
doesn't really look like you're doing
circles<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.490> want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.760> do<00:01:42.850> circles<00:01:43.330> with

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
circles you want to do circles with

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.590 
circles you want to do circles with
