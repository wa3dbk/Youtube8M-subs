00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
bronze block and bronze should be pretty

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.710 
bronze block and bronze should be pretty
easy<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.290> find<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.980> won't<00:01:46.130> be<00:01:46.220> hard<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.460> make

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
easy to find so it won't be hard to make

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.360 
easy to find so it won't be hard to make
bonds<00:01:47.720> tool<00:01:47.990> sets<00:01:48.200> okay<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.590> let's<00:01:49.040> just<00:01:49.220> put

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
bonds tool sets okay so let's just put

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.760 
bonds tool sets okay so let's just put
these<00:01:49.550> back<00:01:51.850> okay<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.750> bronze<00:01:53.960> things

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
these back okay on to the bronze things

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.550 
these back okay on to the bronze things
that<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:54.980> can<00:01:55.100> make<00:01:55.190> stuff<00:01:55.460> out<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.730> it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
that you can make stuff out of it

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.260 
that you can make stuff out of it
obsidian<00:01:59.020> and<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.530> at<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.130> moment<00:02:01.310> um<00:02:04.270> this

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
obsidian and so at the moment um this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.210 
obsidian and so at the moment um this
does<00:02:05.510> not<00:02:05.660> work<00:02:05.840> because<00:02:06.110> audio<00:02:06.560> mod<00:02:06.770> has<00:02:07.010> not

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
does not work because audio mod has not

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.010 
does not work because audio mod has not
been<00:02:07.340> updated<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.910> he<00:02:08.030> has<00:02:08.149> added<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.600> song<00:02:08.780> yet

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
been updated so he has added a song yet

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.500 
been updated so he has added a song yet
but<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.830> future<00:02:10.010> it<00:02:10.160> will<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.390> make

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
but in the future it will be so you make

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.030 
but in the future it will be so you make
a<00:02:11.600> bronze<00:02:11.810> music<00:02:12.170> disc<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:12.950> make

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
a bronze music disc and you can make

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.430 
a bronze music disc and you can make
buckets<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.580> at<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.330> moment<00:02:14.690> buckets<00:02:15.110> don't

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
buckets and at the moment buckets don't

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.160 
buckets and at the moment buckets don't
do<00:02:15.530> anything<00:02:15.709> special<00:02:16.330> if<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:17.600> he<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.959> going

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.960 
to add it's what he said he's going to
add<00:02:20.690> liquids<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.470> future<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
add liquids in the future and so the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.430 
add liquids in the future and so the
bombs<00:02:23.150> bucket<00:02:23.480> will<00:02:23.570> have<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.720> purpose<00:02:24.020> okay

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
bombs bucket will have a purpose okay

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.400 
bombs bucket will have a purpose okay
then<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.550> make<00:02:25.700> um<00:02:26.680> bronze<00:02:31.990> infused<00:02:32.990> coal

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
then you can make um bronze infused coal

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.460 
then you can make um bronze infused coal
which<00:02:33.800> burns<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.700> boss<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.570> i'll<00:02:36.410> show

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
get much wood and i'll show you the end

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.699 
get much wood and i'll show you the end
of<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:43.970> how<00:02:44.209> much<00:02:44.390> that's<00:02:44.600> cooked<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.080> it's

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
of this how much that's cooked and it's

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.970 
of this how much that's cooked and it's
at<00:02:45.890> 63<00:02:46.489> right<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:46.930> okay<00:02:47.930> let's<00:02:48.739> put<00:02:48.890> these

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
at 63 right now okay let's put these

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.530 
at 63 right now okay let's put these
back<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.380> smelting<00:02:52.209> okay<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.269> you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
back on to the smelting okay so you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.830 
back on to the smelting okay so you
start<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:53.900> coal<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.470> coal<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.340> smelt

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
start with coal and coal so you smelt

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.580 
start with coal and coal so you smelt
cool<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.709> will<00:02:58.040> make<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:59.170> will<00:03:00.170> make<00:03:00.350> oil

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
cool and it will make it will make oil

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.900 
cool and it will make it will make oil
and<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.370> then<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.120> smelt<00:03:02.450> oil<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.810> get

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and so then you smelt oil and you get

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.060 
and so then you smelt oil and you get
wax<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.200> with<00:03:09.350> wax<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.100> can<00:03:11.050> make<00:03:12.070> candles

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
wax and with wax you can make candles

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.949 
wax and with wax you can make candles
but<00:03:13.340> at<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.760> moment<00:03:13.880> direction<00:03:14.450> recipe<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
but at the moment direction recipe is

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.259 
but at the moment direction recipe is
not<00:03:15.140> working<00:03:15.560> i<00:03:15.709> do<00:03:15.769> not<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.130> why<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.730> it's

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
not working i do not know why and it's

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.759 
not working i do not know why and it's
just<00:03:17.920> something<00:03:19.000> yeah<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.989> makes<00:03:21.200> inc<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
just something yeah what makes inc and

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.850 
just something yeah what makes inc and
then<00:03:22.010> with<00:03:22.250> three<00:03:22.550> zinc<00:03:23.140> yeah<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.440> smelting

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
then with three zinc yeah so smelting

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.300 
then with three zinc yeah so smelting
coal<00:03:25.220> make<00:03:25.640> zinc<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:27.230> then<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:27.560> three<00:03:27.920> zinc

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
coal make zinc and then with three zinc

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
coal make zinc and then with three zinc
you<00:03:28.610> can<00:03:28.760> make<00:03:28.940> oh<00:03:30.670> yeah<00:03:31.670> yeah<00:03:31.970> mccoy<00:03:32.870> ille

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you can make oh yeah yeah mccoy ille

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.600 
you can make oh yeah yeah mccoy ille
it<00:03:34.290> has<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.800> middle<00:03:34.950> three<00:03:35.220> because

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
it has to be in the middle three because

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.050 
it has to be in the middle three because
it's<00:03:35.760> not<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.940> yeah<00:03:36.950> okay<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.220> then<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it's not a yeah okay and then you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.650 
it's not a yeah okay and then you
basically<00:03:39.420> can<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.960> smelt<00:03:40.290> all<00:03:40.500> these<00:03:40.830> into

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
basically can just smelt all these into

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
basically can just smelt all these into
dusts<00:03:42.980> show<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.490> this<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.330> don't<00:03:45.510> need<00:03:45.630> to
