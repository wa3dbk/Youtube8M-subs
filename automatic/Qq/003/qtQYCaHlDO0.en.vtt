okay we're going to see how we stitch a
ball<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.120> how<00:00:03.810> we<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.460> particularly<00:00:05.460> closable

ball and how we do particularly closable
and<00:00:06.210> get<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> last<00:00:06.540> stitches<00:00:07.049> into<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.379> ball

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
and get the last stitches into the ball

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.169 
and get the last stitches into the ball
and<00:00:07.710> where<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.429> they<00:00:08.550> where<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.030> they

most of the panels can be done initially
in<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.810> making<00:01:06.960> pairs<00:01:07.619> or

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in this way and you're making pairs or

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
in this way and you're making pairs or
sets<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.430> three<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.420> relatively

sets of three which is relatively

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.670 
sets of three which is relatively
straightforward<00:01:11.000> at<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> stage<00:01:12.510> making<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
straightforward at this stage making a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.420 
straightforward at this stage making a
set<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.250> panels<00:01:15.140> when<00:01:16.140> those<00:01:16.290> panels<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.280> made

set of panels when those panels are made
in<00:01:17.640> two<00:01:17.759> sets<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.450> start<00:01:18.810> making<00:01:19.200> them

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
in two sets we then start making them

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.730 
in two sets we then start making them
into<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.740> complete<00:01:20.400> ball<00:01:21.080> at<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.290> point<00:01:22.560> the

into a complete ball at which point the
ball<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> turned<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.270> way<00:01:24.479> around

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ball is turned then the right way around

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
ball is turned then the right way around
and<00:01:25.290> any<00:01:25.500> further<00:01:25.770> stitches<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.970> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and any further stitches have to be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
and any further stitches have to be
stitched<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.600> from<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> outside<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
the ball this can take up to 15 minutes
just<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.030> scene<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> most

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
just to do one scene and is the most

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.340 
just to do one scene and is the most
skilled<00:01:58.680> part<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> operation<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.780> working

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
skilled part of the operation is working

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
skilled part of the operation is working
from<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.920> outside<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> ball<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
from the outside of the ball at this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420 
from the outside of the ball at this
stage<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.540> putting<00:02:04.530> all<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> stitches<00:02:05.250> on

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
stage and putting all the stitches on

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850 
stage and putting all the stitches on
the<00:02:05.640> inside<00:02:06.079> so<00:02:07.079> he's<00:02:07.200> turning<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the inside so he's turning all the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270 
the inside so he's turning all the
panels<00:02:08.250> over<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.649> threads<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.920> coated<00:02:11.250> with

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
panels over the threads are coated with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.730 
panels over the threads are coated with
special<00:02:11.760> wax<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:12.840> he<00:02:12.959> pulls

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
special wax and as he pulls

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.630 
special wax and as he pulls
he<00:02:14.070> pulls<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.000> thread<00:02:15.300> crack<00:02:16.490> speed<00:02:17.490> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
he pulls and this thread crack speed of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.010 
he pulls and this thread crack speed of
the<00:02:17.790> stitch<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.210> speed<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.570> pulling<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the stitch and speed of pulling the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
the stitch and speed of pulling the
stitches<00:02:19.800> tight<00:02:20.100> cause<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.060> crack<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
stitches tight cause that crack and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
stitches tight cause that crack and
actually<00:02:21.750> melts<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> wax<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.650> sets<00:02:23.070> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually melts the wax and sets the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.500 
actually melts the wax and sets the
stitch<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.630> seam<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.200> held<00:02:25.440> solid

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
stitch in the seam so it's held solid

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.600 
stitch in the seam so it's held solid
each<00:02:27.510> time<00:02:27.780> he<00:02:27.930> makes<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.260> few<00:02:28.440> stitches<00:02:28.680> he<00:02:29.460> has

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
each time he makes a few stitches he has

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
each time he makes a few stitches he has
to<00:02:29.760> move<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.270> open<00:02:30.750> part<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.140> seam

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
to move the open part of the seam

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.350 
to move the open part of the seam
towards<00:02:31.920> them<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.790> actually<00:02:32.940> access

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
towards them so you can actually access

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.140 
towards them so you can actually access
that<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.980> takes<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.340> considerable<00:02:35.640> amount<00:02:36.000> of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that that takes a considerable amount of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.500 
that that takes a considerable amount of
time<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.570> strength<00:02:38.120> could<00:02:39.120> see<00:02:39.300> him<00:02:39.390> here

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
time and strength could see him here

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.430 
time and strength could see him here
turning<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.050> he<00:02:41.010> opens<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.550> pre<00:02:41.940> stitched

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
turning it he opens up the pre stitched

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.830 
turning it he opens up the pre stitched
holes<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.950> bowl<00:02:44.100> with<00:02:44.310> an<00:02:44.400> awl<00:02:44.750> puts<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
holes in the bowl with an awl puts the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.460 
holes in the bowl with an awl puts the
needles<00:02:46.140> through<00:02:46.380> from<00:02:46.590> both<00:02:46.800> sides<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.510> then

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
needles through from both sides and then

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190 
needles through from both sides and then
pulls<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.010> tight<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.550> he<00:02:51.210> does<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
pulls it tight and he does that on a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.360 
pulls it tight and he does that on a
full<00:02:52.470> ball<00:02:52.650> over<00:02:53.010> 1,800<00:02:53.790> times<00:02:55.370> 1,800
