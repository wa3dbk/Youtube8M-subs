00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 average wait for housing in Ufa has already exceeded 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.240
 50 thousand rubles per square meter in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.059
 other cities and districts this figure is not 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 much lower reason for high prices shortage 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 land so here i am square in the center 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.089
 long sold out now they have to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 outbid at market value 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.020
 with third parties during the meeting on 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 social housing issues 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.880
 it was noted that the construction of housing 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 economy class is the task of power number 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.390
 one president of bashkortostan rustem 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 Hamitov turn said that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.769
 quadrature value should not exceed 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.940
 among monthly wages 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.190
 region, the real ratio should be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 The following is the monthly salary 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 match the square cost 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.850
 meter then another person somehow can 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 predict your future 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 it is necessary to drag large developers 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 you need a regulatory framework very much 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.629
 bureaucracy a lot of hooks most 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.910
 different around this case again so 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 say a muddy environment exists in the form 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.600
 all sorts of land swindlers scale 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.670
 problems we understand we understand exactly the same 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.020
 that without solving this problem we develop 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.299
 rich roma resident amen him 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.920
 remembers this place from childhood says that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.650
 here weary growth continued 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 down until last year now 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 territory did not recognize the village grew 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.229
 it was in that very field when he became 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.869
 the housing issue turned out to be here 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.060
 much cheaper than anywhere else 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 I had enough money I think in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 principle that I have enough for housing in Ufa 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 but there prices are very cosmic 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 and Bulgakov also housing itself the torus well yes 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 the oldest house is very expensive 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.360
 with a plot costs about one and a half 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.119
 million and here a new home is cheaper 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 much more than the old bulgakov 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 Ufa and we fal ilyukhina and a few days 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.119
 the grandson of the first inhabitant appeared 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.850
 the village is young there is no home here 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.820
 grandmother lives says that there is everything 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.890
 conditions for decent education warmly 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.590
 light and cozy in general straight pleases that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.810
 all around the forest 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.329
 for the young this is very good 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.459
 option that is inexpensive and fair 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.560
 decoration and the number of first inhabitants of the new 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.590
 the village has 25 families in total 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.450
 it is planned that order will live here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.760
 7,000 people for information this is more than 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.950
 in the very Bulgakov strands on pace 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.930
 construction is clear that if nothing 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.569
 it will be here very soon 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.390
 whole quarter but for example chicken 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.030
 honey is almost ready to former field 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.709
 there will also be kindergarten schools 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.250
 polyclinics 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.349
 fitness complexes and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 Sosa other objects besides 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.329
 planned construction 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:46.030
 social housing itself is our main 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.470
 the task this year is to build a social 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.590
 housing for residents 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.799
 first of all ufa district today we 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.290
 we have an order for 129 apartments 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.129
 federal targeted programs and I think 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.269
 that this is only the beginning further we 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.170
 going to increase volumes 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.269
 social housing construction 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.889
 one more important moment with 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.510
 integrated development of this area 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.220
 First, all possible 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.230
 communication is a fundamental difference 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.540
 from construction let's say chamonix villages 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.220
 on and Zhukov recall your time 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.980
 officials and approached the issue 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.569
 construction of these villages in a complex 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.359
 eventually people suffer for lack of 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.400
 good roads of gas or light a spring 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.739
 or in the fall you will not pass here at all 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.359
 Bulgakov again before starting 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.180
 building a house is first carried out 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.919
 preparatory work that is 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.380
 communications to houses under construction already 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.859
 failed started healthy sweat 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.959
 continued plumbing and sewage and on 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.480

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.859
 quarter fully secured 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.660
 engineering communications 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.370
 about the scale of the whole construction and 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.430
 communications in particular say 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.720
 basic facts tens of kilometers 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.099
 sewer gas and water 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.299
 pipes annually sent to you 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.130
 Bulgakov suppliers 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.670
 it's more than anything 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.069
 another object under construction in the republic 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.200
 maxi clans Bogdanova war party 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.390
 state certificate per million 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.170
 rubles for housing decided to exchange for a house in 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.170

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.910
 in the ear of such prices have long been over a million 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.620
 I wanted to buy two hundred lights 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.290

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.650

 conditions of the auction that investor wins 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.729
 which will offer the lowest price for 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.580
 square meter while overstating and and 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.150
 after the developer has no right goes 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.169
 land inventory work 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.210
 Republican and regional and

 land database of the regions and 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.669

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.960
 submitted to the auction as soon as 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.390
 let's start a mass arrange will go 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.490
 automatically and the price reduction will go 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.250
 increase in demand and accordingly so

 merge bulgakov and how to become his 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.810
 sequel though judging by the scale 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.849
 this bulgakov itself will become part of the new 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.349
 settlement this project 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.179
 the only one that is carried out 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.459
 now in close proximity to 

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:46.319
 already build a variety of houses 

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.179

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.360
 social houses has already been determined but 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.490
 there is still a lot of work to build 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.459
 bridge road hold water gas and light 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.379
 and this is about 15 billion rubles but 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.389
 but after three years at this place 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.499
 the whole district of new buildings will grow 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.050
