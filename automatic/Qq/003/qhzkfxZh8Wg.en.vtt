00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.120
 to the channel welcome to another video 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 information could be more informative 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 lately the truth of been thinking 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.780
 very much I was here thinking a lot 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 about some things then of the channel 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.800
 today only good as I have here 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 and some games the truth enough 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.539
 good that we could upload to the channel and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 simply for the simple stupidity of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 that we could not buy a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.910
 controller I can not get to get on 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 and then what do you have in mind 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 brakes you're going to brakes prisoners 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.829
 our piles of money and calm 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.899
 we relax the tits that we ask you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.219
 Not even good money, do not you ever 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.809
 I would ask would never be as stupid as 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.870
 to ask all thousand subscribers 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.059
 but good for is the reason for this video 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.030
 I do not know what is the reason why you are 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.690
 making this video today on Tuesday 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.260
 well the day Saturday night 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.589
 I put a tweet that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.410
 if I quote you, it says of the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.839
 next way to see media gaming 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.630
 we want capturing for mister not you 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.729
 I leave the link of the channel and I put 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.530
 retweet and put there a little box 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.370
 other faces like happy and good 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.800
 what I want to get with this tweet is 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.900
 something next kids I'll leave the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.660
 tweet link here at the bottom 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.750
 in the description and only I want 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.910
 what they do is that we bother a little 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.070
 avermedia every time they comment I think 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.660
 comment with good if you want or 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.720
 insane and if you want to help me a little 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.270
 me with having average and do not catch up 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.970
 and help nurture and sponsor in the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.310
 channel we want sponsors something like that 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.440
 because it can be the reason for this video what 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.760
 that gets the captor so that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.170
 fight so he wants to be captured 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.000
 wants to earn more money no no no 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.010
 reassure yourself that they pay me as always 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.750
 the days there are clouds but good the culture 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.950
 is for obviously we have content a 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 little bit more varied it's true that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.760
 I have stuck to them and to all of you 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.119
 fascinates me lie if it's amazing that 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.040
 we saw two thousand to two thousand reproductions 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.959
 as fast as in 23 days we have 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.300
 the thousands productions is fantastic 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.400
 but I know we can upload another type 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.530
 of content we can live 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.689

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.159

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.370
