had an outside window and that's how we
control<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.760> temperature<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.170> root

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320

cellar this morning it is 50 52 degrees
we<00:00:28.260> try<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> keep<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> around<00:00:29.070> 50<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> also

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
we try to keep it around 50 but you also

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
we try to keep it around 50 but you also
have<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.320> aware<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> temperature

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
have to be aware of what the temperature

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.850 
have to be aware of what the temperature
is<00:00:32.340> outside<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.690> open<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.350> window<00:00:34.530> too

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is outside if you open that window too

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.420 
is outside if you open that window too
much<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.239> too<00:00:36.420> cold<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.430> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
much you can too cold in here so it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
much you can too cold in here so it
stays<00:00:38.730> between<00:00:39.030> 40<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.719> 50<00:00:40.170> which<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
stays between 40 and 50 which is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650 
stays between 40 and 50 which is
absolutely<00:00:41.160> perfect<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
fruit citrus and our potatoes and last

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
fruit citrus and our potatoes and last
summer<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> tough<00:00:57.570> potato<00:00:58.140> year<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.530> had

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
summer was a tough potato year we had

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
summer was a tough potato year we had
the<00:00:58.770> blight<00:00:59.010> in<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> Vermont<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the blight in here in Vermont so the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.030 
the blight in here in Vermont so the
yield<00:01:01.890> wasn't<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.640> great<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.420> normal<00:01:07.040> that's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
yield wasn't as great as normal that's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.880 
yield wasn't as great as normal that's
an<00:01:08.189> ingenious<00:01:08.640> storage<00:01:09.060> idea<00:01:09.960> yeah<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.710> works

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
an ingenious storage idea yeah it works

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.660 
an ingenious storage idea yeah it works
really<00:01:11.189> well

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
really well

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
really well
like<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:11.970> old<00:01:12.090> sink<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.110> old

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
like an old sink and this is an old

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.749 
like an old sink and this is an old
wooden<00:01:13.500> barrel<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.369> uh-huh<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
wooden barrel that we use uh-huh and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.170 
wooden barrel that we use uh-huh and
normally<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:19.490> carrots<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
normally if we have carrots this time of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.100 
normally if we have carrots this time of
year<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.759> big<00:01:23.759> tub<00:01:24.150> with

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
year they would be in a big tub with

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.600 
year they would be in a big tub with
sawdust<00:01:25.860> green<00:01:26.490> sauce<00:01:26.729> works<00:01:27.060> extremely<00:01:27.570> well

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
sawdust green sauce works extremely well

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.300 
sawdust green sauce works extremely well
so<00:01:29.610> our<00:01:29.759> root<00:01:29.970> cellar<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.310> here's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.080 
jams here there's a little of everything
this<00:02:07.110> time

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
this time

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090 
this time
territory<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.330> low<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.979> part

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
territory just low so this is just part

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.770 
territory just low so this is just part
of<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.370> basement<00:02:11.550> along<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.420> right

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
of your basement along right right

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.810 
of your basement along right right
alongside<00:02:13.050> your<00:02:13.440> yes<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.520> heating

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
alongside your yes your heating

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.710 
alongside your yes your heating
operations<00:02:15.530> temperature<00:02:16.530> down<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.950> remains

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
operations temperature down here remains

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.450 
operations temperature down here remains
that<00:02:18.720> furnace<00:02:19.230> going<00:02:19.520> 75<00:02:20.520> degrees<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:23.070> this

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
that furnace going 75 degrees so this

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.800 
that furnace going 75 degrees so this
time<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> year<00:02:23.850> if<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.000> want<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.510> bring<00:02:24.600> in
