00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 because the advertisement showed the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.770
 Teaching time and they said that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.350
 working hours 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.960
 These figures come from the oecd study 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.179
 education at a glance 2014 refers 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.640
 the message how to continue one page 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.310
 leafs through a single in this study 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 The study has far side 550 pages 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.689
 then you have listed the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 Working time of the teachers 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 not just from teaching time 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 exists and the working time of the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.949
 teachers in Austria the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.600
 All are paid by the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.950
 Ministries are each reported 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.730
 oecd is over twelve percent above that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 eu-cut 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 the whole working time why is that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 that's relatively easy we explained 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 have in Austria a system that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.980
 internationally we are quite unusual 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 have at school in principle 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.949
 Simply put, a professional group 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.829
 namely teachers 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 busy and nothing else and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 internationally it is not common there 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.680
 you have other person in the administrative and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 in the educational support area 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 that's what they do in Austria 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.100
 teachers and therefore is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 your lessons you spend 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 in international comparison relative 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.659
 low but your total working time 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.860
 higher because they gave up all these 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 have to do it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 that is the background of the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 history and it is always over 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.909
 the lesson I am completely exhausted 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 they had a professor play with them 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.740
 that are on longtime demand of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.060
 the union we need more 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.710
 Support staff 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 it is also budgetary I am with 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.890
 completely useless academics and them 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 Academic with activities like I know 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.740
 do not copy things for hours 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.820
 leave the apprentice to himself 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.700
 can do 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 that is completely budgetarily pointless only 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.149
 then we need other staff too 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 At the schools then you can over a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.600
 other distribution of the working time of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.520
 teachers 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.350
 of course because they talk the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 have addressed teacher salaries 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.340
 then I would like to say something yes 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.759
 Of course, in the lord with them 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.229
 Of course, they are high president 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.479
 but you have to know that stands 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 also in the study urgently the net 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.789
 media say nothing less technical 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.379
 the average net 1 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.459
 come the employee in austria 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.489
 is about 50 above the oecd cut 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.769
 yes we are a high wage country 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.989
 of course must compare fairly 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.629
 you deserve other professions 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.430
 who are academically educated and there 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.780
 it is the individual with the teachers 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.819
 countries are very different there 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.609
 all deserve korea at the top because 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.599
 teachers 36% more than other academics 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.060
 in south korea 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.329
 in germany, for example, is about 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 right in austria in the oecd cut 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.209
 twelve percent less 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.799
 The teachers deserve as others 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.379
 academics in each country 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.540
 In Austria, we are at 60 percent 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.099
 that an academically trained teacher 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.090
 in comparison to an academy in 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.109
 Austria deserves that from there 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.970
 high-priced to talk 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.769
 I think I'm wrong but I am 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.829
 just down at the very same time 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.060
 I also believe that you are among them 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.040
 even with you that you school 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.150
 can do some things and I believe you 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.010
 That should not just always be the negative 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.290
 I do not think you can handle it 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 get the money in the short term because that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.169
 already takes a while in the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.819
 development but to take an example 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.349
 that it also happens when you lie 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.639
 hears only the bad things 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.989
 For example, we have in the computer sector at so far 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.760
 teachers also the edv 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.900
 supervised schools and for one 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.639
 get bills 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.139
 that became social partnership 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.540
 changed that the parts not 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.310
 need to be cared for pedagogically 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.870
 but if there is a software 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.669
 on his computer has nothing to do with it 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.180
 educational work to do that in 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.519
 future 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.650
 they do not do it 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.810
 academics are therefore cheaper and 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.400
 in sum, the school still has more 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.810
 working time is available 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.060
 Overall, cheaper anyway 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.379
 So you can do something here myself 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.120
 is of course not happen to 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.939
 not the 343 million 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.770
 Development budget this year is missing now 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.870
 through this measure this year 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.840
 But you can certainly do things 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.330
 develop and save so sensibly 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.890
 without being cheated anyone 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.220
 and without the pedagogy under it 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.220
 suffers
