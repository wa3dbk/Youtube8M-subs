00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.550
 look at the look of how it looks on 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.290
 on top there are two such ribs 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.540

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 fan and they are backlit blue 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.500
 front socket we have here can be something 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 put contain some devices 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.180

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 microphone headphones on this side 2 ports 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 ibo 30 reset button 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.700
 The indicator of money is not in front of a big 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.040
 back off button 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.439
 we have a housing on the cover 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.000
 transparent window and bottom ribs then 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.390
 I will show you more in detail 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.649
 inside and back of the case 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.850
 looks like this now 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.430
 in detail we will review the power supply 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 installed below respectively below 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.020
 here we have several 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 water system installation holes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.439
 cooling and seat under 120 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.460
 millimeter fan here 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.189
 accordingly installed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.840
 motherboard just below two 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.729
 wires what kind of wires are these on 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.000
 in fact it is rather strange 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.910
 solution from zalman here we connect here 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.230
 these wires are soldered accordingly 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.070
 front panel and allow you to connect to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.830
 front nesba 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.420
 30 pairs there any device why 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.560
 do not make internal connections 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 directly inside the case to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.239
 motherboard is not clear why 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.380
 made form at such wires that is 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.590
 if i disconnect 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.560
 standard usb port like this 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.390
 done now let's see how the hull y 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.810
 us looks inside inside layout 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.780
 Here is such a bottom, respectively, we are two 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.350
 holes on the bottom on the bottom 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.470
 the wall here are dust filters and on one 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.100
 a block is installed from the body parts 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 the power supply below is also a field filter 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 right hard drives 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.320
 well, so they are not in the basket 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.700
 here is a 120 millimeter screw for their 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.430
 cooling also with a blue backlight a little 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.750
 above we can install here 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.990
 corresponding device 525 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.080
 and further already directly 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.990
 motherboard everything is enough 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.780
 compact here you can fit 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.360
 that's how cable management looks like a block 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.750
 I have power with standard wires 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400
 I do not snoot exact they do not turn off and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.190
 even with such a power supply everything is fine 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 accordingly located you see 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.420
 that no wires stick out that wire 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.200
 a bunch on this is the power of the video card 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.050
 further sata the wires are there a little bit 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.920
 motherboard power and processor 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.800
 there it is not even visible from above 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.560
 CPU power itself 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.220
 on top as i said two fans 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.270
 here they are located here 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.590
 additionally on the side covers we 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.560
 we can set the appropriate 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.300
 fans they are connected by 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.120
 normal moths with default connector 1 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.030
 there is a fan on the wall on one of 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.790
 walls and, accordingly, the usual Alex 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.250
 the whole thing is clinging on the power supply 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.290
 on the back wall you can attach such 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.950
 same fan and it will all be very 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.500
 OK 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.110
 blow our hard drives also with 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.870
 the sides as it is set very 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.910
 just here , respectively, there is 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.210
 this drawer right now, I'll show him like this 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.400
 here she clings 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.699
 using loosening 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.139
 cogs corresponding and removed here 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:51.490
 these settlements here are set 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.860
 the fan will now show how it all 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.340
 it looks like the dark 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.870
 the hdd indicator from the front is on 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.550
 sides like this respectively wall 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.990
 transparent it means soap inside 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.259
 can also put the fan with 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.310
 backlit and it will look 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:15.550
 cool as regards 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.630

 working out just cool tough 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.720
 cold wheels 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.460
 no more than 30 degrees load and this 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.289
 very happy that we have from 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.210

 extension cord in order to be able to 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.389
 lengthen from power supply apologizing there 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.780
 sony called me what car rides 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.660
