with<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> frog<00:02:03.180> who<00:02:03.750> I've<00:02:03.899> become<00:02:04.310> well

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
with this frog who I've become well

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
with this frog who I've become well
acquainted<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.479> what<00:02:06.659> does<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.869> actually

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
acquainted to but what does it actually

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.160 
acquainted to but what does it actually
look<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> picture<00:02:08.879> at<00:02:09.209> 1.8

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.400 
look like when you get a picture at 1.8
first<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.800> picture<00:02:11.099> at<00:02:11.330> 22<00:02:12.330> what's<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
first a picture at 22 what's going on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
first a picture at 22 what's going on
here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
here
well<00:02:14.250> what's<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.960> your<00:02:16.440> depth

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
well what's going on is that your depth

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.820 
well what's going on is that your depth
of<00:02:16.890> field<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.430> changing<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:18.300> shallow<00:02:19.200> depth<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
of field is changing a shallow depth of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.110 
of field is changing a shallow depth of
field<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:21.000> you're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
field is what you see when you're

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.930 
field is what you see when you're
shooting<00:02:21.300> at<00:02:21.540> 1.8<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.320> very<00:02:22.710> narrow<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.820> your

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.840 
shooting at 1.8 it's very narrow so your
focus<00:02:24.390> point<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:25.020> your<00:02:25.620> area<00:02:25.980> focus<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> very

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
focus point or your area focus is very

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.630 
focus point or your area focus is very
small<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.960> numbers<00:02:28.380> go<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.920> all<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> way

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
small as the numbers go up all the way

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.510 
small as the numbers go up all the way
here<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:29.970> 22<00:02:30.600> your<00:02:31.350> focus<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.980> changing<00:02:32.490> so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
here to 22 your focus is changing so

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.830 
here to 22 your focus is changing so
more<00:02:32.880> things<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.600> focus

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
more things are going to be in focus

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.530 
more things are going to be in focus
from<00:02:34.200> front<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.740> back<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:36.000> important

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
from front to back so that's important

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.450 
from front to back so that's important
to<00:02:36.630> keep<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.960> mind<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.830> we're<00:02:37.980> doing<00:02:38.280> here

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.830 
to keep in mind so what we're doing here
is<00:02:38.490> i'm<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.790> photograph<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.420> frog<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
is i'm going to photograph the frog and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.350 
is i'm going to photograph the frog and
i'm<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.710> focus<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.310> its<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.910> one

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
i'm going to focus in on its I at one

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.000 
i'm going to focus in on its I at one
point<00:02:42.600> eight<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.800> work<00:02:43.950> my

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
point eight then I'm going to work my

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.250 
point eight then I'm going to work my
way<00:02:44.190> all<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.820> way<00:02:44.850> up<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> 22<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.080> can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
way all the way up to 22 so that you can

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780 
way all the way up to 22 so that you can
see<00:02:46.470> what's<00:02:46.650> happening<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> background

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
see what's happening to the background

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.190 
see what's happening to the background
then<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.240> going<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.420> talk<00:02:48.630> about<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.110> and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
then we're going to talk about it and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.780 
then we're going to talk about it and
figure<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.610> little

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
figure out you know the little

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120 
figure out you know the little
subtleties<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.630> are<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.800> right

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
subtleties that are going on so right

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.680 
subtleties that are going on so right
now<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> camera<00:02:54.000> set<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.270> aperture

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
now I have the camera set to aperture

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.720 
now I have the camera set to aperture
priority<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.860> aperture<00:02:56.190> priority<00:02:56.430> means

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
priority but aperture priority means

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
priority but aperture priority means
that<00:02:56.880> i<00:02:57.030> am<00:02:57.240> setting<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.870> aperture<00:02:58.260> i'm

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that i am setting my aperture i'm

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.730 
that i am setting my aperture i'm
picking<00:02:59.580> where<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> want<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:01.140> camera

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
picking where I want it and the camera

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.740 
picking where I want it and the camera
is<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.790> select<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.450> shutter

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
is then going to select the shutter

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.590 
is then going to select the shutter
speed<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> proper<00:03:05.160> exposure<00:03:05.610> let's<00:03:06.450> shoot

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
speed for a proper exposure let's shoot

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.870 
speed for a proper exposure let's shoot
at<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:06.900> point<00:03:07.110> eight<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.890> I'm<00:03:07.980> wet<00:03:08.130> 1.8<00:03:08.700> right

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
at one point eight so I'm wet 1.8 right

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.080 
at one point eight so I'm wet 1.8 right
now<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.300> focused<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.080> on<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> frogs<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.190> boom

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
now I'm focused in on the frogs I boom

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.470 
now I'm focused in on the frogs I boom
that's<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.140> point<00:03:13.440> eight<00:03:14.030> let's<00:03:15.030> take<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that's one point eight let's take it to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.240 
that's one point eight let's take it to
f<00:03:15.630> 2.8<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.120> nice<00:03:18.269> smile<00:03:19.130> now<00:03:20.130> I'm

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
f 2.8 there's just a nice smile now I'm

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.280 
f 2.8 there's just a nice smile now I'm
making<00:03:20.489> sure<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.209> almost<00:03:21.540> did<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.230> I'm

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
making sure I almost did this here I'm

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
making sure I almost did this here I'm
going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.470> shoot<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.800> there<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> cut<00:03:23.940> her<00:03:24.060> finger

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060 
going to shoot it there I cut her finger
off<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.750> saw<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:25.680> why<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.890> didn't

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.860 
off and I saw it so that's why I didn't
shoot<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.370> initially<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.209> I'm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
shoot it initially but now I'm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.390 
shoot it initially but now I'm
recomposing<00:03:29.959> boom<00:03:30.959> I'm<00:03:31.350> making<00:03:31.890> sure<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.370> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.759 
recomposing boom I'm making sure that I
have<00:03:32.580> her<00:03:32.790> finger<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.320> so

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
have her finger in there and I do so

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.190 
have her finger in there and I do so
that<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.010> really<00:03:35.040> sharp<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.570> can<00:03:36.750> see<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
that is really sharp you can see in the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.930 
that is really sharp you can see in the
pictures<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.800> background<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.550> nice<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pictures that the background is nice and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
pictures that the background is nice and
blown<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.390> when<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.600> talk<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.840> blown<00:03:40.350> out

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
blown out when we talk about blown out

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.250 
blown out when we talk about blown out
it's<00:03:41.130> compressed<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.209> that's<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.019> point<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
it's compressed so that's the point of

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.440 
it's compressed so that's the point of
using<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.620> piece<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.190> glass<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.360> i'm

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
using a piece of glass like this and i'm

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.790 
using a piece of glass like this and i'm
probably<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.989> switch<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.500> bigger

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
probably going to switch to the bigger

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.860 
probably going to switch to the bigger
piece<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.160> glass<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.640> 300<00:03:48.120> 28<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.660> few

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
piece of glass of 300 28 in a few

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.780 
piece of glass of 300 28 in a few
minutes<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.160> how<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:50.610> can

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
minutes so that we can see how we can

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.729 
minutes so that we can see how we can
really<00:03:51.209> compress<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.870> background<00:03:52.290> step<00:03:52.590> away

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
really compress the background step away

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.650 
really compress the background step away
from<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.040> tree<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.580> make<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> parking<00:03:54.540> lot

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
from the tree and make a parking lot

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.180 
from the tree and make a parking lot
look<00:03:55.260> really<00:03:55.500> awesome<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.920> we're<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
look really awesome so we're going to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.690 
look really awesome so we're going to
come<00:03:56.340> back<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.660> couple<00:03:57.810> seconds

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
come back to that in a couple seconds

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.120 
come back to that in a couple seconds
well<00:03:59.700> why<00:03:59.820> don't<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.060> sit<00:04:00.300> back<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:01.130> just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
well why don't you sit back on it just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
well why don't you sit back on it just
face<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.820> way<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.209> rest<00:04:03.570> your<00:04:03.660> tuchus

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
face that way but just rest your tuchus

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.370 
face that way but just rest your tuchus
own<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> now<00:04:06.600> we're<00:04:06.840> ready<00:04:07.019> to

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
own on it so now we're ready to

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.650 
own on it so now we're ready to
photograph<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.310> swing<00:04:08.550> here<00:04:08.850> I'm<00:04:09.030> locking<00:04:09.330> in

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.920 
photograph the swing here I'm locking in
on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.380> tripod<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.519> I<00:04:11.580> have<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
on the tripod just so that I have a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.330 
on the tripod just so that I have a
something<00:04:12.930> that's<00:04:13.080> not<00:04:13.200> moving<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.250> each

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
something that's not moving so that each

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.729 
something that's not moving so that each
image<00:04:14.610> kind<00:04:15.209> of<00:04:15.330> stays<00:04:15.510> similar<00:04:15.959> right<00:04:16.590> now

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
image kind of stays similar right now

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.250 
image kind of stays similar right now
I'm<00:04:16.890> set<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.390> shutter<00:04:18.390> priority<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.200> that

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
I'm set to shutter priority and that

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.050 
I'm set to shutter priority and that
means<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.130> i<00:04:20.340> am<00:04:20.400> setting<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.850> shutter

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
means that i am setting the shutter

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.400 
means that i am setting the shutter
speed<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> camera<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.020> going<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
speed and the camera is going to do the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.900 
speed and the camera is going to do the
rest<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.979> work<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.460> sure<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.760> it's

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
rest of the work to make sure that it's

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.909 
rest of the work to make sure that it's
exposed<00:04:24.360> properly<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.260> i'm<00:04:25.650> going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> start

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
exposed properly so i'm going to start

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.360 
exposed properly so i'm going to start
at<00:04:26.160> one-tenth<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.150> a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
at one-tenth of a

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.700 
at one-tenth of a
second<00:04:27.669> remember<00:04:28.300> how<00:04:28.389> slow<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.720> was<00:04:29.139> you

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
second remember how slow that was you

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.219 
second remember how slow that was you
could<00:04:29.889> hear<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.250> sound<00:04:30.699> of<00:04:31.060> how<00:04:31.900> slow<00:04:32.199> that

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
could hear the sound of how slow that

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.469 
could hear the sound of how slow that
was<00:04:32.440> when<00:04:32.770> we<00:04:32.919> were<00:04:33.100> testing<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:34.210> letting<00:04:34.419> you

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
was when we were testing and letting you

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.210 
was when we were testing and letting you
hear<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.900> different<00:04:35.260> shutter<00:04:35.470> speeds<00:04:35.770> now

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
hear the different shutter speeds now

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.920 
hear the different shutter speeds now
let's<00:04:36.460> see<00:04:36.580> what<00:04:36.729> happens<00:04:37.060> when<00:04:37.270> we<00:04:37.660> move<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
let's see what happens when we move the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.040 
let's see what happens when we move the
swing<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:39.240> shoot<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.389> at<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> tenth<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
swing and shoot it at a tenth of a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.570 
swing and shoot it at a tenth of a
second<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.860> I'm<00:04:44.919> going<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.070> try<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.310> capture

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
second so I'm going to try to capture

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.480 
second so I'm going to try to capture
the<00:04:45.790> swing<00:04:46.000> at<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.210> very<00:04:46.389> bottom<00:04:46.630> boom<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.889> as

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
the swing at the very bottom boom and as

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.100 
the swing at the very bottom boom and as
we<00:04:48.639> look<00:04:48.790> at<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> swing<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.870> see<00:04:50.080> that

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
we look at the swing you can see that

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.659 
we look at the swing you can see that
it's<00:04:50.560> kind<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.860> hard<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.100> see<00:04:51.280> because<00:04:51.430> it's

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
it's kind of hard to see because it's

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.210 
it's kind of hard to see because it's
actually<00:04:51.850> blurring<00:04:52.630> its<00:04:53.620> blurring<00:04:53.919> because

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
actually blurring its blurring because

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.340 
actually blurring its blurring because
the<00:04:54.310> shutter<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.639> moving<00:04:55.120> really<00:04:55.510> slow<00:04:56.080> and

the shutter is moving really slow and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.620 
the shutter is moving really slow and
there<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:57.010> some<00:04:57.160> motion<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.060> swing<00:04:58.389> so<00:04:58.510> we

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
there is some motion to the swing so we

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.230 
there is some motion to the swing so we
have<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.870> think<00:04:59.110> what<00:04:59.860> do<00:05:00.280> we<00:05:00.370> need<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.580> do<00:05:00.880> to

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
have to think what do we need to do to

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.360 
have to think what do we need to do to
freeze<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.930> swing<00:05:02.260> that<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.560> moving<00:05:02.919> let's
