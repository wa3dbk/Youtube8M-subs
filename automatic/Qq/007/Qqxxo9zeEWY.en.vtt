unfortunately<00:00:51.910> this<00:00:52.060> knot<00:00:52.360> does<00:00:53.020> create<00:00:53.410> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
unfortunately this knot does create a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.780 
unfortunately this knot does create a
knot<00:00:55.270> loop<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.170> can't<00:00:56.680> actually<00:00:56.950> just

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
knot loop so you can't actually just

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.250 
knot loop so you can't actually just
pull<00:00:58.060> it<00:00:58.210> out<00:00:58.330> like<00:00:58.360> this<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:58.900> untie<00:00:59.200> it

pull it out like this and untie it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.380 
pull it out like this and untie it
because<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.740> will<00:00:59.860> create<00:01:00.070> them<00:01:00.280> not<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:01.270> what

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
because it will create them not so what

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.210 
because it will create them not so what

inside but we're gonna start this on the
outside<00:01:40.319> so<00:01:41.319> we're<00:01:41.770> starting<00:01:41.920> this<00:01:42.130> seam<00:01:42.399> here

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
outside so we're starting this seam here

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.789 
outside so we're starting this seam here
you<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.329> see<00:01:43.479> I'm<00:01:43.810> using<00:01:44.109> very<00:01:44.380> little<00:01:44.679> this

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
you can see I'm using very little this

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.620 
you can see I'm using very little this
is<00:01:44.859> a<00:01:45.009> normal<00:01:45.369> size<00:01:45.549> tie<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.090> I'm<00:01:46.179> extra<00:01:46.450> long

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
is a normal size tie so I'm extra long

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.539 
is a normal size tie so I'm extra long
not<00:01:46.959> extra<00:01:47.200> short<00:01:47.469> but<00:01:48.100> I'm<00:01:48.189> just<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.429> very

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
not extra short but I'm just a very

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.690 
not extra short but I'm just a very
large<00:01:48.789> guy<00:01:48.999> I'm<00:01:49.630> gonna<00:01:49.719> start<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:51.549> go

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
large guy I'm gonna start here just go

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.260 
large guy I'm gonna start here just go
over<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.090> top<00:01:53.069> bring<00:01:54.069> it<00:01:54.159> through<00:01:54.399> in<00:01:55.179> the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
over the top bring it through in the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.569 
over the top bring it through in the
middle<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.740> we're<00:01:56.829> gonna<00:01:56.920> create<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> spiral

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
middle and we're gonna create the spiral

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.330 
middle and we're gonna create the spiral
this<00:01:58.209> is<00:01:58.389> this<00:01:58.539> way<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.899> spiral<00:01:59.319> this<00:01:59.920> way<00:02:00.100> is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
this is this way the spiral this way is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.739 
this is this way the spiral this way is
a<00:02:00.369> triangle<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.029> can<00:02:01.179> see<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.420> difference

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
a triangle you can see the difference

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.929 
a triangle you can see the difference
here<00:02:01.810> when<00:02:02.319> you're<00:02:02.439> looking<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.939> rather

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
here when you're looking at it rather

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.699 
here when you're looking at it rather
than<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.479> spiral<00:02:04.899> here<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.289> just<00:02:05.439> goes<00:02:05.590> around

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
than the spiral here it just goes around

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.420 
than the spiral here it just goes around
the<00:02:05.920> seams

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the seams

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.160 
the seams
so<00:02:07.150> now<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.360> we've<00:02:07.510> created<00:02:07.660> this<00:02:07.840> spiral

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so now that we've created this spiral

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.740 
so now that we've created this spiral
and<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> go<00:02:08.680> back<00:02:08.920> around<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.729> behind<00:02:10.240> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and to go back around and behind the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.940 
and to go back around and behind the
narrow<00:02:10.960> end<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:12.220> gonna<00:02:12.310> come<00:02:12.700> back<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:13.950> over

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
narrow end I'm gonna come back in over

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.580 
narrow end I'm gonna come back in over
the<00:02:15.070> top<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.480> here's<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.750> special<00:02:16.990> part<00:02:17.350> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the top and now here's a special part I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.620 
the top and now here's a special part I
let<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.300> see<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
let go in the back here you can see the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.750 
let go in the back here you can see the
back<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.440> there<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:21.430> actually<00:02:21.520> gonna

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
back is right there I'm actually gonna

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.700 
back is right there I'm actually gonna
pull<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.120> knot<00:02:22.470> through<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.990> create<00:02:26.560> this

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
pull this knot through and create this

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.820 
pull this knot through and create this
not<00:02:27.040> backwards<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:28.300> I'm<00:02:28.390> looking<00:02:28.690> at<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
not backwards so now I'm looking at I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.470 
not backwards so now I'm looking at I
don't<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:30.370> what<00:02:30.520> I'd<00:02:30.640> call<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.240> just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
don't know what I'd call this it's just

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
don't know what I'd call this it's just
kind<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> backwards<00:02:31.990> not<00:02:32.860> let<00:02:33.310> me<00:02:33.370> show<00:02:33.520> you

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
kind of a backwards not let me show you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.930 
kind of a backwards not let me show you
that<00:02:33.730> move<00:02:33.880> one<00:02:34.060> more<00:02:34.180> time<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.670> start

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that move one more time now to start

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.510 
that move one more time now to start
from<00:02:37.060> beginning<00:02:37.330> if<00:02:38.020> you're<00:02:38.200> proud<00:02:38.380> not<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
from beginning if you're proud not you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.080 
from beginning if you're proud not you
go<00:02:39.670> over<00:02:41.070> through<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.100> bottom<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.700> up

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
go over through the bottom and up

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
go over through the bottom and up
through<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.990> middle<00:02:44.610> making<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.820> spiral

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
through the middle making a spiral

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.660 
through the middle making a spiral
then<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:47.709> gonna<00:02:47.800> bring<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.100> around<00:02:48.250> back

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
then you're gonna bring it around back

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.020 
then you're gonna bring it around back
and<00:02:50.190> you're<00:02:51.190> gonna<00:02:51.280> let<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.790> back

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
and you're gonna let go in that back

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.340 
and you're gonna let go in that back
part<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.570> how<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.930> kind<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.170> loose

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
part you see how this is kind of loose

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.170 
part you see how this is kind of loose
here<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.400> probably<00:02:54.520> see<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.910> put<00:02:55.090> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
here so you can probably see this put it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.580 
here so you can probably see this put it
better<00:02:55.330> I'm<00:02:55.540> gonna<00:02:55.630> go<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> top

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
better I'm gonna go through the top

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.780 
better I'm gonna go through the top
middle<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.290> I'm<00:02:59.380> gonna<00:02:59.470> bring<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.800> into

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
middle and now I'm gonna bring it into

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.280 
middle and now I'm gonna bring it into
the<00:03:01.150> middle<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.690> actually<00:03:02.050> what<00:03:02.170> I'm

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the middle of this is actually what I'm

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.380 
the middle of this is actually what I'm
tying<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.709> knot<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.060> gonna<00:03:04.150> just

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
tying the knot and I'm gonna just

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.900 
tying the knot and I'm gonna just
loosely<00:03:04.840> bring<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.170> up<00:03:05.290> nice<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.340> loose<00:03:06.520> weight

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
loosely bring it up nice a loose weight

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.820 
loosely bring it up nice a loose weight
when<00:03:07.090> we<00:03:07.209> use<00:03:07.330> when<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.780> do<00:03:07.900> knots<00:03:08.140> keep

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
when we use when we do knots keep

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.199 
when we use when we do knots keep
everything<00:03:09.040> loose<00:03:09.280> it's<00:03:09.550> nice<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> easy

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
everything loose it's nice and easy

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.360 
everything loose it's nice and easy
make<00:03:10.959> sure<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.200> all<00:03:11.290> flattened<00:03:11.769> out<00:03:11.890> what<00:03:12.280> I

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
make sure it's all flattened out what I

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.220 
make sure it's all flattened out what I
like<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.580> do<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.790> actually<00:03:12.970> pinch<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.959> seams

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
like to do is actually pinch the seams

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.920 
like to do is actually pinch the seams
make<00:03:14.920> them<00:03:15.070> flatter<00:03:15.390> bring<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.540> little<00:03:16.750> more

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
make them flatter bring a little more

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.560 
make them flatter bring a little more
pinch<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.890> now<00:03:18.760> here's<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.120> tricky<00:03:19.390> part

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
pinch it now here's the tricky part

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.900 
pinch it now here's the tricky part
here's<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> fun<00:03:20.019> part<00:03:20.050> right<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> back

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
here's the fun part right in the back

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.850 
here's the fun part right in the back
here<00:03:22.269> very<00:03:23.200> hard<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.440> see<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
here very hard to see you have a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.430 
here very hard to see you have a
straight<00:03:24.250> line<00:03:24.459> that's<00:03:25.300> going<00:03:25.540> horizontal

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
straight line that's going horizontal
