hey<00:00:05.360> guys<00:00:05.630> we<00:00:05.990> are<00:00:06.020> here<00:00:06.170> going<00:00:06.710> to<00:00:06.859> make<00:00:07.040> a

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
hey guys we are here going to make a

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.509 
hey guys we are here going to make a
charger<00:00:07.609> mobile<00:00:08.269> phone<00:00:08.510> charger<00:00:08.980> so<00:00:09.980> looking

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
charger mobile phone charger so looking

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.550 
charger mobile phone charger so looking
at<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:10.670> circuit<00:00:11.090> from<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:11.390> breadboard

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:12.560 
at the circuit from the breadboard

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.950 
at the circuit from the breadboard
up<00:00:12.770> man<00:00:14.200> here<00:00:15.200> we<00:00:15.410> have<00:00:15.680> connected<00:00:16.580> a<00:00:16.850> 1<00:00:17.720> kilo

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
up man here we have connected a 1 kilo

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.630 
up man here we have connected a 1 kilo

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
ohm resistor another 220 R and this is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.050 
ohm resistor another 220 R and this is
my<00:00:23.330> yard<00:00:23.630> with<00:00:24.080> prevent<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.770> charge<00:00:25.039> to<00:00:25.910> be

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
my yard with prevent the charge to be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.260 
my yard with prevent the charge to be
drained<00:00:26.330> from<00:00:26.660> mine<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.440> this<00:00:28.190> is<00:00:28.250> resistor

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
drained from mine and this is resistor

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.709 
drained from mine and this is resistor
transistor<00:00:30.100> these<00:00:31.100> are<00:00:31.340> wires<00:00:31.719> was

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
transistor these are wires was

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.889 
transistor these are wires was
completing<00:00:33.289> the<00:00:33.440> circuit<00:00:33.859> and<00:00:34.420> this<00:00:35.420> is<00:00:35.660> the

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
completing the circuit and this is the

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.510 
completing the circuit and this is the
input<00:00:36.410> satellite<00:00:37.310> from<00:00:37.930> breadboard<00:00:38.930> here

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
input satellite from breadboard here

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.540 
input satellite from breadboard here
inside<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.760> breadboard<00:00:41.149> everything<00:00:41.660> is<00:00:41.840> fine

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
inside the breadboard everything is fine

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.460 
inside the breadboard everything is fine
usual<00:00:43.550> supply<00:00:43.910> 9<00:00:44.210> word<00:00:44.480> from<00:00:44.780> here<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.230> have

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
usual supply 9 word from here you have

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.520 
usual supply 9 word from here you have
to<00:00:46.070> move<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.460> in<00:00:46.640> fixed<00:00:47.090> 9<00:00:47.300> more<00:00:47.600> chip<00:00:48.290> with

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
to move it in fixed 9 more chip with

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.040 
to move it in fixed 9 more chip with
this<00:00:52.329> now<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.579> output<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.180> given<00:00:56.629> from

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
this now and the output is given from

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.910 
this now and the output is given from
here<00:00:57.520> looking<00:00:58.520> at<00:00:58.610> this<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.870> wire<00:01:00.110> this

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
here looking at this and this wire this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.869 
here looking at this and this wire this
is<00:01:01.129> negative<00:01:01.640> in<00:01:02.539> this<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.930> positive<00:01:03.699> look<00:01:04.699> at

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
is negative in this is positive look at

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:21.670 
is negative in this is positive look at
this<00:01:17.590> it's<00:01:18.590> charging<00:01:19.780> use<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:21.049> wire<00:01:21.290> cutter

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
this it's charging use a wire cutter

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.630 
this it's charging use a wire cutter
from<00:01:25.479> now<00:01:26.479> switch<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.380> charger<00:01:27.979> from<00:01:28.280> here

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
from now switch on the charger from here

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.499 
from now switch on the charger from here
we<00:01:29.020> power<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.979> night<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:31.369> switch<00:01:31.640> on<00:01:35.439> ok

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
we power is the night in switch on ok

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.469 
we power is the night in switch on ok
you<00:01:38.509> should<00:01:38.750> supply<00:01:39.020> 9<00:01:39.380> volt<00:01:40.720> look<00:01:41.720> at<00:01:41.930> this

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
you should supply 9 volt look at this

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.840 
you should supply 9 volt look at this
it's<00:01:44.479> charging<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:47.150> fine<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:48.079> working

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
it's charging so it's fine it's working

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.760 
it's charging so it's fine it's working
now<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:49.909> can<00:01:50.270> make<00:01:50.479> your<00:01:50.720> own<00:01:50.840> charter<00:01:53.770> at

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
now you can make your own charter at

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.749 
now you can make your own charter at
home<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.369> picnic<00:01:56.030> at<00:01:56.720> any<00:01:56.960> place<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:58.070> remember

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
home a picnic at any place but remember

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.090 
home a picnic at any place but remember
that<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.150> should<00:01:59.180> supply<00:01:59.630> 9<00:02:00.020> volt<00:02:00.350> input

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
that you should supply 9 volt input

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.569 
that you should supply 9 volt input
direct<00:02:01.729> Ford<00:02:01.970> Edge<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:03.619> necessary<00:02:04.250> for<00:02:04.340> a
