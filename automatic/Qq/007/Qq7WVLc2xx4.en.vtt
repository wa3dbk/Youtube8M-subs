00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
thing is you're always trying to do

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.240 
thing is you're always trying to do
things<00:00:52.079> differently<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.770> you're<00:00:53.070> always

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
things differently because you're always

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
things differently because you're always
engaged<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.030> different<00:00:54.360> players<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
different styles and stuff like that so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
different styles and stuff like that so
there's<00:00:56.820> never<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.410> basically<00:00:59.100> it's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
there's never you know basically it's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
there's never you know basically it's
the<00:00:59.309> same<00:00:59.399> challenge<00:01:00.030> trying<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> figure<00:01:00.660> out

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the same challenge trying to figure out

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
the same challenge trying to figure out
you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:01.710> players<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.190> doing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and what they might have and if you have

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
and what they might have and if you have
a<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.790> hand<00:01:06.000> maximizing<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> value<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a good hand maximizing the value and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
a good hand maximizing the value and
losing<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> least<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
losing the least when you don't have a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.250 
losing the least when you don't have a
good<00:01:09.630> hand<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.450> never<00:01:12.810> changes

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
good hand so you know that never changes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.810 
good hand so you know that never changes
but<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.640> challenging
