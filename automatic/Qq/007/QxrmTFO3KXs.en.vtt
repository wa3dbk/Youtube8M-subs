shot I think where this will come into
its<00:02:47.810> own<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.620> shot<00:02:48.860> chafing<00:02:49.280> ability<00:02:49.700> of

the heel
beware<00:03:26.480> camera<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:30.400> wasn't<00:03:31.400> too<00:03:31.640> bad<00:03:31.970> actually

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
beware camera I wasn't too bad actually

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.759 
beware camera I wasn't too bad actually
I<00:03:32.360> did<00:03:32.510> catch<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.840> heel<00:03:33.019> side<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.380> sensor

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
I did catch that heel side of sensor

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.979 
I did catch that heel side of sensor
it's<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:34.640> got<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.819> little<00:03:35.239> bit<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.450> fade<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.840> it

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
it's just got a little bit of fade on it

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.780 
it's just got a little bit of fade on it
now<00:03:36.350> if<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.470> do<00:03:36.590> try<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.920> shape<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.400> golf<00:03:37.579> ball

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
now if I do try and shape the golf ball

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.270 
now if I do try and shape the golf ball
like<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.480> where<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:39.100> theory<00:03:40.100> it

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
like so this is where in theory it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.319 
like so this is where in theory it
should<00:03:40.310> come<00:03:40.549> into<00:03:40.670> its<00:03:40.880> own<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.030> little<00:03:41.239> bit

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
should come into its own a little bit

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.920 
should come into its own a little bit
more<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.040> forged<00:03:43.519> head<00:03:43.910> let<00:03:44.720> me<00:03:44.810> hit

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
there's no doubt about it but it just

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.540

as<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.820> other<00:04:42.910> ones<00:04:43.150> do<00:04:43.360> it's<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:44.020> club<00:04:44.229> that's

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
as the other ones do it's a club that's

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.870 
as the other ones do it's a club that's
worth<00:04:44.680> trying<00:04:45.039> if<00:04:45.250> you're<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> single<00:04:45.639> figure

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
worth trying if you're a single figure

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.909 
worth trying if you're a single figure
handicapper<00:04:46.570> or<00:04:46.750> certainly<00:04:47.320> aiming<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.800> get

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
handicapper or certainly aiming to get

handicapper or certainly aiming to get
in<00:04:48.009> single<00:04:48.280> figures<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:49.060> one<00:04:49.270> that's<00:04:49.750> trying

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
in single figures it's one that's trying

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960 
in single figures it's one that's trying
but<00:04:50.229> you've<00:04:50.349> got<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.740> four<00:04:50.949> other<00:04:51.130> options<00:04:51.550> on

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
but you've got the four other options on

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.850 
but you've got the four other options on
three<00:04:52.360> other<00:04:52.509> options<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.020> say<00:04:53.229> but<00:04:53.830> a

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
three other options I say but a

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230 
three other options I say but a
definitely<00:04:54.280> worth<00:04:54.370> trying<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.759> bit<00:04:54.910> more<00:04:55.120> if

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
definitely worth trying a bit more if

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.089 
definitely worth trying a bit more if
you<00:04:55.270> want<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.509> bit<00:04:55.630> more<00:04:55.780> forgiveness<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.530> would

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
you want a bit more forgiveness I would

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.550 
you want a bit more forgiveness I would
say<00:04:57.310> definitely<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:58.060> ap1<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.320> most

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
say definitely the ap1 is the most

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.439 
say definitely the ap1 is the most
forgiving<00:05:00.009> got<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.580> ap2<00:05:01.000> as<00:05:01.150> being<00:05:01.330> the

forgiving got the ap2 as being the
