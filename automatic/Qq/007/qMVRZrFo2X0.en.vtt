I'm doing a point this is our V RP is
Reese<00:00:05.430> parking<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.029> watercraft<00:00:06.450> dream

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.570 

the<00:00:10.200> water<00:00:10.380> couple<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.890> nineties<00:00:11.220> was<00:00:11.400> so

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
the water couple of the nineties was so

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
the water couple of the nineties was so
much<00:00:11.760> fun<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.360> were<00:00:12.660> easy<00:00:13.050> to<00:00:13.440> toss<00:00:13.620> around

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
much fun they were easy to toss around

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.180 
much fun they were easy to toss around
they<00:00:14.460> had<00:00:14.610> good<00:00:15.330> zip<00:00:15.630> good<00:00:16.020> acceleration<00:00:16.350> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
they had good zip good acceleration and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.130 
they had good zip good acceleration and
it<00:00:17.400> wasn't<00:00:17.700> going<00:00:17.850> fast<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.450> was<00:00:18.540> going<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it wasn't going fast it was going that

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710 
it wasn't going fast it was going that
below<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.860> around<00:00:20.279> 40<00:00:20.790> miles<00:00:20.940> per<00:00:21.119> hour

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
below or around 40 miles per hour

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
below or around 40 miles per hour
but<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.200> was<00:00:22.380> plenty<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.279> speed<00:00:23.760> give<00:00:24.210> him

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
but this was plenty of speed give him

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
but this was plenty of speed give him
the<00:00:24.450> feeling<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:25.020> closeness<00:00:25.290> to<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> water

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the feeling a closeness to to the water

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
the feeling a closeness to to the water
so<00:00:27.270> how<00:00:27.450> could<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.020> be<00:00:28.380> questioned<00:00:28.890> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so how could we be questioned this

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
so how could we be questioned this
product<00:00:29.640> architecture<00:00:30.270> bring<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.290> the
