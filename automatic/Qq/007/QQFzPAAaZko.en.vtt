00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.140
 but from local 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.350
 yes 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.080
 let's see 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.600
 hello today we are going to make a cake 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.700
 cheese that does not need an oven 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.510
 Cheesecake will carry 500 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.070
 milliliters of liquid cream to assemble 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 250 grams of cheese is the type 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.560
 philadelphia but we are going to use 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 mascarpone cheese 150 grams of milk 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.670
 100 grams of sugar and 7 slices of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.850
 neutral gelatin and then for the base 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 we are going to use 100 grams of butter and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.310
 200 grams of cookies we are going to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.070
 use digestive biscuits and above 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.480
 the cake is going to bring dulce de leche this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.890
 dulce de leche is very good since you 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 bought several times and the truth is that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 we like it a lot, it's Mercadona 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.410
 if you are interested in the first thing we are going to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.410
 do is going to be crushing the cookies 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.320
 this is if I do have a point 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.289
 once we have crushed all the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.850
 cookie we have already melted the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.479
 butter in the microwave we're going to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.479
 mix it 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.380
 once we have mixed everything we go 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.350
 to enter it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.750
 we are going to use a mold of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.840
 these 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.960
 It has a diameter of 22 23 centimeters 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.960
 approximately 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.800
 now we are going to introduce it into the mold 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.800
 to form the base 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.480
 after having distributed all the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.520
 mix by the base of the mold let's go 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.330
 pressing the edges so that all 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.330
 stay even 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.090
 and the next thing we're going to do is going to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.670
 be introduce the base in the fridge 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.020
 while we make the cake of and what 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.420
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160
 moisturize the gelatins that we are going to take 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.980
 in a cold water dish and we're going to 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.180
 introduce them until they hydrate 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.219
 for 34 minutes 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.370
 in a pot we are going to introduce the 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:59.730
 ingredients while we are going to heat up 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.730
 medium fire let's introduce the cream 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.140
 the milk 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.780
 the sugar 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.859
 and the case mascarpone 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.810
 and while it is heating up to fire 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.370
 medium, we are going to remove it from time to time 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.370
 when to prevent it from sticking 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.180
 after it has warmed up and all 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.310
 the ingredients are integrated let's 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.310
 to drain the gelatin and introduce it 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.349
 the next thing we will do is remove 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.970
 until the gelatin has been integrated 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.800
 and once it has been integrated 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.800
 we will remove the pot from the fire 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.799
 preventing it from boiling 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.980
 let's add the cheesecake to the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.980
 base 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.520
 now we will let the cake lose a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.000
 little temperature let it cool 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.000
 in the fridge 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.840
 but from local 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.940
 They have not given me 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.320
 true 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.320
 but 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.220
 mine 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.020
