00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.680

 and the vines did not have to say ok this 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.400
 coconut water and nothing else the water the coconut 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.140
 no and the coconut water is going to help them 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 very much to lose weight because it is 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.970
 super detoxifying and apart as it has 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.040
 calories that are low in calories but 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 You have calories, you go, it will help you 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.570
 feel you going and it is hydrating a lot 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.270
 then it is a very important component 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.810
 to burn more fat and lose weight is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.930
 to be super hydrated this is I take 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.900
 Up to 3 liters of water per day then 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.000
 means that I lived 8 to 10 times 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.220
 day that 's normal that means that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.470

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.150
 sleep better and your mind will be more 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.150
 clear though then coconut water 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.959
 although next my favorite fruit and the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 beautiful papaya this fence I love 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.790
 because it is super good for digestion 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.220
 the papaya is going to help you burn fat 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.300
 is going to help you lose weight is super 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.480
 high in fiber and one thing that is a fact 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.140
 and that is a fact that I did not know but 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.850
 the seeds of the papaya contain 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.770
 very many fiber then I sometimes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 what I do is that when you leave 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.570
 throw it away everything that as two grabbed like 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.910
 two tablespoons of potato seeds and 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.800
 I bring it to him or I put it in a glass and 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.660
 I swallow it and that also helps you a lot 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.069
 digestion ok and next banana and I 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.560
 I know many people think that the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.209
 banana and that because there is not much sugar 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.850
 I'm going to eat it because it's going to make me 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.069
 get fat and I thought that too and almost 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.040
 I did not eat a plate or always the typical one 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.660
 in diets since there is half a banana not 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.910
 I know what not 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.210
 you can not eat all you want and 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.340
 will help you burn fat a very thing 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.410
 important is that the plate has to 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.020
 be mature then if it's yellow 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.850
 do not eat it like that, wait until you have 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.340
 more little black dots because this wants 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.220
 say that better activate all 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.280
 antioxidants vitamins fiber and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.680
 is going to digest much easier in your 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.500
 body apart that the banana as it is 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.110
 sweet is going to go and it's going to fill you 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
 to help you not sit down or be 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.340
 you are hungry in a little while and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.550
 eat other things then the banana is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.440
 terrific another very important fruit and 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.200
 very good to burn fat are the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.290
 apples and you know what typical saying of 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.990
 than an apple a day to avoid going to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.520
 doctor I do not know how much but but the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.410
 true that yes or the apples are 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.400
 extremely high in fiber and this helps 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.520
 extract the fat from your body then 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.550
 you need 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.050
 of this food has a lot of fiber and that 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.590
 is what you need to burn fat 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.380
 and I also recommend that before 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.140
 eat you eat one or two apples and this 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.870
 is going to help you not eat so much and you 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.170
 will help you lose weight ok then they are 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.450
 ideal for as you bring in your bag or 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.880
 If you do not have a bag in the car, 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.500
 apples for you to eat and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.220
 when you are hungry ok 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.890
 next is oranges and oranges and 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.650
 the orange is an acid fruit and the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.440
 orange is super sweet is super high in 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.050
 Vitamin C as you know it is very high in 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.720
 antioxidants and it's going to help you burn 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.320
 fat because it has a lot of fiber and 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.890
 apart almost all the city fruit has 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.900
 fewer calories than the sweetest fruit and 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.160
 that is, that's not why you're not going to eat 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.500
 sweet fruit but how low it is 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.330
 low in calories high in fiber and high in 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.670
 water content is going to help you 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.260
 burn fat 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.360
 next is grapefruit and I know that 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.280
 many of you have heard and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.860
 they know that grapefruit is burning fat and 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.560
 Of course grapefruit is true 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.800
 very much to burn fat and I recommend 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.050
 eat the grapefruit at night the best 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.150
 what can you do 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.990
 another fruit that will help them a lot 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:30.090
 to the weight are strawberries and strawberries 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.330
 because it is other is an acid strawberry and 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.790
 They are super super low calorie or is 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.960
 and it does not have much sugar either 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:42.330
 It is an excellent fruit if you are looking for 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.760
 not eat so much sugar but still 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.620
 you need antioxidants the company is 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.390
 excellent another of my favorite fruits 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:55.290
 It's pineapple and pineapple is great for 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:57.870
 burn fat and to detoxify the pineapple 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.870
 apart from super sweet but you have to 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.600
 make sure you are very mature for what 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.670
 this sweet and the pineapple I love 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.150
 add the smoothies or just 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.300
 eat it that way it's really good and it's 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.890
 another fruit asia also the kiwi also 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.520
 another fruit that will help you burn 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.790
 grease 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.330
 the kiwi is very high in vitamin c is 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.980
 very high in antioxidants and has a lot 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.260
 fiber then it will help you burn 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.840
 fat and remember that you can eat the 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.850
 kiwi peel then I before 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720
 he always took it off but he does not know 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:37.020
 malaga the truth does not come out much 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.300
 although another fruit that is the tomato and I 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.060
 love I love tomatoes you're going to 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.640
 help a lot to burn fat the 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.970
 Tomato is also known because it helps 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.160
 to fight cancer and finally the 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.260
 lemon green all the acids for the 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.600
 acidic fruit specifically the 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.090
 citrus fruits are going to help you a lot 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.340
 of weight and to burn fat 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.770
 then the lemon I love because it 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.870
 you can put it in a salsita or a 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.600
 salad or whatever and it puts the same 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.150
 Sito and it gives him a flavor 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.610
 and it's much better to use lemon than to use 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.170
 olive oil other things to have 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.630
 fat then when you do a 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.580
 salad is better to put a lot of lemon and 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.410
 Let that be your dressing because it's going 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.140
 help burn fat at the same time 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.940
 one last thing that I want to mention 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.310
 is that if all this fruit is going to help you 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.890
 to burn fat but it's not that I'm going to 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.620
 eat a grapefruit a day but I'm going to 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.570
 keep eating tacos and quesadillas and 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.150
 then I'm going to burn fat no 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:39.240
 It works like this is everything you do in 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.950
 your diet is going to count then it is and I 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.620
 I always say it's super important 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.410
 bring fruit with you and fill your house with 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.050
 fruit so you can eat this and that's going to 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:52.170
 help burn more fat is not there 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.540
 a special recipe or a special fruit 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.730
 to burn fat is to change your 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.730
 food change your lifestyle 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.380
 that's what in the end you're going 

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.180
 to help burn all the fat that 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.280
 you have to love and lose weight and 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.740
 you felt your super well and so then 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.930
 I hope you liked this 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.960
