think<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:31.140> first<00:04:31.350> half<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:32.190> start<00:04:32.550> better

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
think the first half you start better

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.640

the<00:04:33.000> game<00:04:33.180> we<00:04:33.540> score<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.470> more

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the game we score but we have more

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.890 
the game we score but we have more
opportunities<00:04:35.280> after<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.820> time<00:04:36.030> my<00:04:36.570> team<00:04:36.780> is

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
opportunities after the time my team is

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.860 
opportunities after the time my team is
a<00:04:36.950> star<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.040> play<00:04:38.190> better<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.670> valid<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.690> game

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
a star to play better and valid the game

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.660

in<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> first<00:04:40.170> half<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:41.010> second<00:04:41.340> half<00:04:41.520> I

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
in the first half the second half I

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.310 
in the first half the second half I
think<00:04:41.700> we<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.150> more<00:04:42.330> control<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.780> game<00:04:42.960> have
