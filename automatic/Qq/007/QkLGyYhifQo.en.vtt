00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 let's see now another example of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.610
 draw parallel lines but on a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.040
 line that we are going to draw or that we 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.010
 let's draw previously let's imagine that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.520
 we want to draw an existing ramp 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.190
 if we have the line that runs along the axis 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.990
 from that ramp we can take topography 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.190
 or what can we 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 measure and mark 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.160
 we will draw for example to draw a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 that could be that new every certain 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 distance or we will mark we will take points 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the center if it is a curved area 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 we will have to have every few 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.829
 meters something so that the route is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.820
 well drawn 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.210
 in the subtractions because a little would be worth 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.630
 in the curves 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.960
 for example, imagine that this is 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.110
 an existing mine ramp for the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.740
 which said as line 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.690
 I'm going to put you started 123 and a 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.790
 pending less 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 - 16% 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 good to imagine you this I have drawn 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.490
 is the axis of an existing ramp 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.580
 then we are going to edit lines 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 we select and we will draw we get 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.320
 the last option stops drawing 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 fireplace then we can draw it with 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.340
 the sections type one that we have 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.190
 saved as we already saw imagine a 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.710
 gallery that is 5 in height 5 in width 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.570
 for example 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.640
 and we say draw 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.260
 in what he did to us was with that section 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.210
 type we will travel all that axis 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.830
 leaving it in the middle at a height of 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.320
 determined soil that we can 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.050
 select us in this way 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.920
 we can draw existing galleries of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.240
 fairly faithful and sufficient in the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 most of the cases to have it in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.939
 three dimensions 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 now let's see another example by 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.090
 example to draw a fireplace 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.670
 good already draws opens a gallery by 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 example is a gallery one 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.280
 infrastructure this is a 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 infrastructure of a holding 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.400
 underground I'm going to draw a chimney 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.490
 I'm going to put a view that I'm worth 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 how do you have a 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.880
 imagine that I want to leave an estimated 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.450
 from this niche is this other frames 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.660
 I'm sure it's fit in inverted 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 surfaces drawing line and it should be 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.230
 in the middle before I had to draw there 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.870
 a better fitting point but good for 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.780
 see how it is from there to there what 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.100
 drawing as a line there is nothing about a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.070
 man without wanting and now simply 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.970
 this is the line the drawn we want 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.030
 see this pit now the unit and you're 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.910
 lines the selection although it does not come out 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.850
 I repeat it is the option you draw fire 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 I say in this case you can simulate a 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.420
 a chimney well circular 5 wide 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.630
 let it be drawing tells us that it can give 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.060
 in certain cases number of sides of that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.489
 circle 14 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.780
 has drawn us the fireplace and in that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.940
 site 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.330
 As you can see it's very easy to do this 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.330
 shape
