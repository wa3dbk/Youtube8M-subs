nobody believed me then but I was

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.579 
nobody believed me then but I was
determined<00:01:01.610> so<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.449> did<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:02.930> degree<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.379> fashion

part<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.370> reason<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:07.760> moving<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.120> Ireland

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
part of the reason for moving to Ireland

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.840 
part of the reason for moving to Ireland
was<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.900> become<00:01:09.050> creative<00:01:09.530> again<00:01:09.920> but<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.640> knew

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
was to become creative again but I knew

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.420 
was to become creative again but I knew
I<00:01:10.909> didn't<00:01:11.150> want<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.360> do<00:01:11.479> clothing<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.040> I

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
I didn't want to do clothing so I

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.570 
I didn't want to do clothing so I
decided<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.390> work<00:01:14.930> back<00:01:15.620> with<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:15.950> textiles

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580

and<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.850> make<00:01:17.000> handbags<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.810> that's<00:01:18.560> really

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
and to make handbags and that's really

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.620

how<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.100> business<00:01:19.460> started<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.390> grown

how the business started and it's grown

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.020 
how the business started and it's grown
from<00:01:20.900> there<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.860> terms<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:22.430> inspires<00:01:22.850> me

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
from there in terms of what inspires me

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.960 
from there in terms of what inspires me
is<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:24.020> pretty<00:01:24.320> much<00:01:24.530> everything<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:25.400> think<00:01:25.760> I

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
is it's pretty much everything I think I

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.420 
is it's pretty much everything I think I
don't<00:01:26.330> know<00:01:26.390> if<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.570> was<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.990> training<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.190> got

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
don't know if it was the training I got

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.249 
don't know if it was the training I got
during<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.060> degree<00:01:29.390> horse<00:01:29.689> or<00:01:30.020> whether<00:01:30.170> I

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
during the degree horse or whether I

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.069 
during the degree horse or whether I
have<00:01:31.219> had<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.520> beforehand<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:32.360> literally

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
have had this beforehand but literally

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.370 
have had this beforehand but literally
everything<00:01:33.469> I<00:01:33.740> see<00:01:34.149> inspires<00:01:35.149> me<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.930> could<00:01:36.170> be

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
everything I see inspires me it could be

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.190 
everything I see inspires me it could be
a<00:01:36.710> pile<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.039> rubbish<00:01:37.490> pile<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.969> leaves<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.630> rusty

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
a pile of rubbish pile of leaves a rusty

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.649 
a pile of rubbish pile of leaves a rusty
tin<00:01:39.409> roof<00:01:39.740> or<00:01:40.100> something<00:01:40.520> more<00:01:41.090> traditionally

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
tin roof or something more traditionally

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.950 
tin roof or something more traditionally
beautiful<00:01:42.170> like<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> landscape<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.810> guess

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
beautiful like a landscape but I guess

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.529 
beautiful like a landscape but I guess
it<00:01:45.109> all<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.380> comes<00:01:45.560> together<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.729> you

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
it all just comes together and and you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.120 
it all just comes together and and you
know<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.780> like<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.899> big<00:01:48.049> melting<00:01:48.469> pot<00:01:48.530> really

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
know it's like a big melting pot really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.800 
know it's like a big melting pot really
but<00:01:49.609> but<00:01:49.850> when<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.119> comes<00:01:50.299> down<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.509> actually

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
but but when it comes down to actually

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.859 
but but when it comes down to actually
designing<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.950> definitely<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.149> fabrics<00:01:53.600> that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
designing is definitely the fabrics that

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.840 
designing is definitely the fabrics that
are<00:01:54.200> available<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.250> colors<00:01:55.609> and<00:01:55.789> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
are available the colors and the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.940 
are available the colors and the
textures<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.659> we're<00:01:57.200> very<00:01:57.380> lucky<00:01:57.530> here<00:01:57.890> in

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
textures and we're very lucky here in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.319 
textures and we're very lucky here in
Ireland<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.460> have<00:01:58.640> several<00:01:59.179> traditional

meals like foxford avoca Hanley's where

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.319 
meals like foxford avoca Hanley's where
you<00:02:03.079> can<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.159> draw<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.759> years<00:02:05.210> of

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
you can you can just draw on years of

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.719 
you can you can just draw on years of
experience<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.350> you've<00:02:07.189> got<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.460> fantastic

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
experience and you've got this fantastic

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.300 
experience and you've got this fantastic
fabrics<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.750> we<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.289> then<00:02:09.470> combine<00:02:09.950> with

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
fabrics that we can then combine with

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.400 
fabrics that we can then combine with
our<00:02:10.429> shapes<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.690> flowers<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.170> ribbons

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
our shapes and the flowers and ribbons

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.890 
our shapes and the flowers and ribbons
that<00:02:12.680> we<00:02:12.890> use<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.280> embellish<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.820> bags<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that we use to embellish the bags and I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900 
that we use to embellish the bags and I
think<00:02:15.260> that's<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:15.770> comes<00:02:16.670> together

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
think that's what really comes together

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.180 
think that's what really comes together
and<00:02:17.300> creates<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.290> makes<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> designs

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

that<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.610> create<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.890> would<00:02:21.890> describe<00:02:22.040> our<00:02:22.610> bags

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
that we create I would describe our bags

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.680 
that we create I would describe our bags
as<00:02:24.370> they<00:02:25.370> some<00:02:25.850> people<00:02:25.880> say<00:02:26.330> they're<00:02:26.480> quite

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
as they some people say they're quite

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.750 
as they some people say they're quite
quirky<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:28.130> suppose<00:02:28.430> they've<00:02:28.610> got

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
quirky and I suppose they've got

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.550 
quirky and I suppose they've got
personalities<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.569> they're<00:02:30.200> colorful

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
personalities that they're colorful

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.360 
personalities that they're colorful
they're<00:02:31.220> very<00:02:31.400> textured<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:34.130> they're

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
they're very textured that they're

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.960 
they're very textured that they're
tactile<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.450> because<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.870> use<00:02:36.080> wool

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
tactile that because we use wool

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.240 
tactile that because we use wool
Lee<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.450> nearly<00:02:37.690> always<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:38.470> they've<00:02:39.070> got<00:02:39.220> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
Lee or nearly always we they've got a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.850 
Lee or nearly always we they've got a
nice<00:02:39.460> soft<00:02:39.850> textured<00:02:40.690> tactile<00:02:41.380> appearance

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
nice soft textured tactile appearance

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.490 
nice soft textured tactile appearance
and<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> do<00:02:42.520> sometimes<00:02:42.790> see<00:02:43.270> people<00:02:43.500> with

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
and you do sometimes see people with

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.290 
and you do sometimes see people with
them<00:02:44.680> sat<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.040> their<00:02:45.190> laps<00:02:45.370> actually<00:02:45.790> stroking

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
them sat on their laps actually stroking

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.610 
them sat on their laps actually stroking
them<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.930> there's<00:02:47.530> something

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
them I think that there's something

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.280 
them I think that there's something
about<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.220> comfort<00:02:48.670> blanket<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.330> them<00:02:49.630> but

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
about the comfort blanket in them but

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.320 
about the comfort blanket in them but
there<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:51.070> guess<00:02:51.370> they're<00:02:51.550> kind<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.120> between

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
there I guess they're kind of in between

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.170 
there I guess they're kind of in between
crafts<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.350> fashion<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:54.190> well<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.940> know<00:02:55.060> they

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
crafts and fashion as well you know they

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.570 
crafts and fashion as well you know they
sort<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> fall<00:02:55.660> between<00:02:55.990> two<00:02:56.320> stools<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.370> I

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
sort of fall between two stools but I

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.830 
sort of fall between two stools but I
think<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.970> main<00:02:58.180> thing<00:02:58.210> they<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.630> they

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
think the main thing they do is they

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.630 
think the main thing they do is they
would<00:02:58.900> seem<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.170> make<00:02:59.290> people<00:02:59.620> happy<00:02:59.980> people

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
would seem to make people happy people

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.160 
would seem to make people happy people
smile<00:03:01.000> when<00:03:01.270> they<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.480> them<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.020> when<00:03:02.140> they

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
smile when they see them and when they

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.110 
smile when they see them and when they
touch<00:03:02.440> them<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:02.920> that's<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.490> great<00:03:03.700> feeling<00:03:03.940> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
touch them and that's a great feeling to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.680 
touch them and that's a great feeling to
see<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.660> love<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.670> process<00:03:07.090> starts<00:03:07.510> with

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
see I love that the process starts with

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.140 
see I love that the process starts with
designing<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.530> shape<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.250> sketch<00:03:09.880> out<00:03:10.090> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
designing the shape so we sketch out the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.480 
designing the shape so we sketch out the
various<00:03:10.450> shapes<00:03:10.750> we<00:03:11.050> want<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.350> use<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.010> then

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
various shapes we want to use and then

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.520 
various shapes we want to use and then
we<00:03:12.640> move<00:03:12.820> into<00:03:13.000> choosing<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.750> fabrics<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
we move into choosing the fabrics the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.040 
we move into choosing the fabrics the
colors<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.280> textures<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.209> then<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:16.810> link

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
colors the textures and then we link

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.810 
colors the textures and then we link
those<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> flowers<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.160> we<00:03:18.459> want<00:03:18.610> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
those with the flowers that we want to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.120 
those with the flowers that we want to
embellish<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.600> bags<00:03:19.810> with<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.380> many<00:03:20.980> of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
embellish the bags with and many of

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.620 
embellish the bags with and many of
these<00:03:21.250> are<00:03:21.490> actually<00:03:21.790> hand<00:03:22.030> made<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:22.540> us<00:03:22.600> by

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
these are actually hand made for us by

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.850 
these are actually hand made for us by
other<00:03:23.050> designers<00:03:23.290> or<00:03:24.040> small<00:03:24.790> teams<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.680> then

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
other designers or small teams and then

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.860 
other designers or small teams and then
it's<00:03:27.040> very<00:03:27.250> much<00:03:27.430> into<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.060> production<00:03:28.480> of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it's very much into the production of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.530 
it's very much into the production of
the<00:03:29.020> bags<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.580> starts<00:03:30.790> off<00:03:31.060> with<00:03:31.209> cutting

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the bags so it starts off with cutting

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.900 
the bags so it starts off with cutting
the<00:03:31.630> cloth<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.040> sew<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.760> pieces

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
the cloth we then sew the pieces

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.330 
the cloth we then sew the pieces
together<00:03:34.320> we<00:03:35.320> sew<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> lining<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
together we sew the lining to the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.850 
together we sew the lining to the
outside<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.000> bag<00:03:37.209> put<00:03:37.870> on<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.110> straps<00:03:38.440> and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
outside of the bag put on the straps and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.550 
outside of the bag put on the straps and
the<00:03:38.920> ribbon<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.459> then<00:03:40.090> finish<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.320> top

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
the ribbon and then finish it with a top

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.130 
the ribbon and then finish it with a top
stitch<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.850> press<00:03:43.420> we<00:03:43.660> use<00:03:43.810> Industrial

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
stitch and a press we use Industrial

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.410 
stitch and a press we use Industrial
pressing<00:03:44.890> machinery<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:45.880> gives<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.360> a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
pressing machinery that gives it a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.320 
pressing machinery that gives it a
really<00:03:46.630> nice<00:03:46.840> crisp<00:03:47.290> finish<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.000> then<00:03:49.120> that's

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
really nice crisp finish and then that's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.300 
really nice crisp finish and then that's
it<00:03:49.510> that's<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.380> process<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:51.040> sounds

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
it that's that's the process it sounds

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.340 
it that's that's the process it sounds
really<00:03:51.430> easy<00:03:51.550> but<00:03:52.030> obviously<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.290> a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
really easy but obviously it's it's a

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.400 
really easy but obviously it's it's a
bit<00:03:53.530> more<00:03:53.680> complex<00:03:54.100> than<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:55.230> enjoy<00:03:56.230> the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
bit more complex than that I enjoy the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.710 
bit more complex than that I enjoy the
initial<00:03:56.830> design<00:03:57.400> process<00:03:57.970> choosing<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
initial design process choosing the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.390 
initial design process choosing the
fabrics<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.350> putting<00:03:59.530> them<00:03:59.620> together<00:03:59.800> but

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
fabrics and putting them together but

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.340 
fabrics and putting them together but
what<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.550> enjoy<00:04:00.940> more<00:04:01.390> than<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
what I enjoy more than that is the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.930 
what I enjoy more than that is the
finished<00:04:02.709> piece<00:04:02.950> seeing<00:04:03.519> all<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.730> those

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
finished piece seeing all of those

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.270 
finished piece seeing all of those
elements<00:04:04.150> come<00:04:04.660> together<00:04:04.860> because<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.010> you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
elements come together because you you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.890 
elements come together because you you
can<00:04:06.430> never<00:04:06.459> really<00:04:06.880> tell<00:04:07.239> how<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.630> going<00:04:07.870> to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
can never really tell how it's going to
