00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you're ready to progress forward and you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're ready to progress forward and you
were<00:01:05.250> literally<00:01:05.960> forward<00:01:07.010> then<00:01:08.010> come<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.280> back

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
were literally forward then come on back

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
were literally forward then come on back
couple<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> steps<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.390> fine

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
couple of steps are fine

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
couple of steps are fine
you<00:01:10.260> need<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> six<00:01:10.979> by<00:01:11.189> six<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> four<00:01:12.030> by

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you need like a six by six or a four by

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.480 
you need like a six by six or a four by
four<00:01:12.210> area<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.080> point<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
four area for this point and then a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.480 
four area for this point and then a
little<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.880> difficult<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.360> lateral<00:01:15.570> motion

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
little more difficult is lateral motion

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.219 
little more difficult is lateral motion
so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.520> sort<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> kick<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.930> foot

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so you sort of have to kick one foot

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039 
so you sort of have to kick one foot
towards<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.770> you'll<00:01:20.670> feel<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> you'll

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
towards the other you'll feel it you'll

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
towards the other you'll feel it you'll
know<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.799> then<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> together<00:01:23.490> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
know and then we can put it together we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.920 
know and then we can put it together we
make<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> box<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> I'll<00:01:25.770> come<00:01:25.950> forwards<00:01:26.340> view

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
make a box so I'll come forwards view

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.730 
make a box so I'll come forwards view

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
pattern anytime I need now if I put the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
pattern anytime I need now if I put the
whole<00:01:42.390> thing<00:01:42.420> together<00:01:43.009> two<00:01:44.009> boxes<00:01:44.369> make<00:01:44.580> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
whole thing together two boxes make it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
whole thing together two boxes make it
very<00:01:44.820> square<00:01:45.119> figure<00:01:45.420> eight<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> following

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
very square figure eight so following

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
very square figure eight so following
forward<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.750> left<00:01:49.369> back

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
forward to my right your left back

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
forward to my right your left back
Center<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.789> then<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.060> let<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.210> flow<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> try

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
Center and then just let it flow and try

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.969 
Center and then just let it flow and try
to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> lost<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> sound<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> rhythm

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to get lost in the sound and the rhythm

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.700 
to get lost in the sound and the rhythm
it<00:01:59.460> should<00:01:59.700> feel<00:01:59.850> good<00:02:00.350> keep<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.380> elbows

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it should feel good keep your elbows

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.149 
it should feel good keep your elbows
behind<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.270> keep<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.420> hands<00:02:03.570> wide<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.950> keep

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
behind you keep your hands wide and keep

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.389 
behind you keep your hands wide and keep
your<00:02:05.280> strokes<00:02:05.550> very<00:02:05.670> very<00:02:06.119> small<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> that's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
your strokes very very small so that's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
your strokes very very small so that's
pretty<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> idea<00:02:09.679> when<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.769> want<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
pretty much the idea when you want to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.979 
pretty much the idea when you want to
progress<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.519> fully<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> use

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
progress it fully if you want to use

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.350 
progress it fully if you want to use
ballistic<00:02:13.500> intervals<00:02:14.090> once<00:02:15.090> you've<00:02:15.209> done<00:02:15.300> all

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
ballistic intervals once you've done all

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.290 
ballistic intervals once you've done all
your<00:02:15.600> motion<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:17.280> speed<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.790> few<00:02:18.110> hold

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
your motion you can speed up a few hold

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.150 
your motion you can speed up a few hold
speed<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> few<00:02:21.630> more<00:02:21.780> holes<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:22.920> rush

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
speed up a few more holes you can rush

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.650 
speed up a few more holes you can rush
forward<00:02:23.569> rush<00:02:24.569> back<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.610> you'll<00:02:26.790> see<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
forward rush back and you'll see the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.559 
forward rush back and you'll see the
cardio<00:02:28.019> picks<00:02:28.260> up<00:02:28.410> very<00:02:28.620> quickly<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> that's<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
cardio picks up very quickly so that's a

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.449 
cardio picks up very quickly so that's a
double<00:02:33.870> unders<00:02:34.110> look<00:02:34.319> like<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> most

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
double unders look like it's the most

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.949 
double unders look like it's the most
intense<00:02:35.819> way<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.299> jump<00:02:36.480> rope<00:02:36.690> some

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
intense way to you to jump rope some

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.870 
intense way to you to jump rope some
people<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.410> triple<00:02:37.650> unders<00:02:37.950> I'm<00:02:38.579> not

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
people can do triple unders I'm not

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.000 
people can do triple unders I'm not
quite<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.390> cool<00:02:39.690> one<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> ways<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.680> we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
quite that cool one of the ways that we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.610 
quite that cool one of the ways that we
cool<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.459> fighter<00:02:42.120> when<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.049> sort<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
cool down fighter when you do sort of a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.280 
cool down fighter when you do sort of a
modified<00:02:44.130> version<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> although<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.959> looks

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
modified version so although this looks

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.640 
modified version so although this looks
a<00:02:46.590> little<00:02:46.950> more<00:02:47.160> simple<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.299> forces<00:02:48.720> timing<00:02:49.350> in

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
a little more simple it forces timing in

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.250 
a little more simple it forces timing in
your<00:02:49.829> footwork<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> goal<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.170> my

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
feet to not look like a change too much
