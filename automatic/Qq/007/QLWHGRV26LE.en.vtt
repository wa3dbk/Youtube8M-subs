wise old mage of the forest who we don't
know<00:06:40.690> yet<00:06:40.900> is<00:06:41.139> actually<00:06:41.470> possessed<00:06:41.919> so<00:06:42.550> we

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
know yet is actually possessed so we

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.580 
know yet is actually possessed so we
have<00:06:43.150> a<00:06:43.180> couple<00:06:43.479> of<00:06:43.540> times<00:06:43.780> then<00:06:44.110> we<00:06:44.260> hit<00:06:44.410> the

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
have a couple of times then we hit the

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.219 
have a couple of times then we hit the
parasite<00:06:45.130> on<00:06:45.280> him<00:06:45.520> raised<00:06:46.419> a<00:06:46.449> bit<00:06:46.720> high<00:06:46.900> for<00:06:47.169> us

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
parasite on him raised a bit high for us

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.530 
parasite on him raised a bit high for us
know<00:06:47.470> if<00:06:47.770> your<00:06:47.949> pixel<00:06:48.310> perfect<00:06:48.580> you<00:06:48.970> can<00:06:49.270> reach

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
know if your pixel perfect you can reach

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:56.969 
know if your pixel perfect you can reach
up<00:06:52.680> come<00:06:53.680> on<00:06:53.710> and<00:06:54.900> avoid<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.080> snowflakes<00:06:56.620> yeah

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
up come on and avoid the snowflakes yeah

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.300 
up come on and avoid the snowflakes yeah
I<00:06:58.320> think<00:06:59.320> there's<00:06:59.710> snowflakes<00:07:00.130> they're

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
I think there's snowflakes they're

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.950 
I think there's snowflakes they're
probably<00:07:00.490> not<00:07:00.699> snowflakes<00:07:01.240> considering<00:07:01.840> the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
probably not snowflakes considering the

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.650 
probably not snowflakes considering the
sin<00:07:02.520> but<00:07:03.520> that's<00:07:03.760> what<00:07:03.940> they<00:07:04.000> look<00:07:04.210> like<00:07:04.240> so

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
sin but that's what they look like so

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.520 
sin but that's what they look like so
that's<00:07:04.900> what<00:07:05.110> they<00:07:05.199> get<00:07:05.350> cold<00:07:07.320> that's<00:07:08.320> what

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
that's what they get cold that's what

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.409 
that's what they get cold that's what
happens<00:07:08.949> and<00:07:09.130> 16-bit<00:07:09.550> games<00:07:09.970> if<00:07:10.150> you<00:07:10.270> look

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419 
happens and 16-bit games if you look

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:20.420 
happens and 16-bit games if you look
like<00:07:10.570> something<00:07:10.930> you<00:07:10.960> get<00:07:11.199> called<00:07:11.470> it<00:07:18.900> yay

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
like something you get called it yay
