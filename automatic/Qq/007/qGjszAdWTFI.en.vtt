00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
sections and hold them together with one

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140 
sections and hold them together with one
hand<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.520> want<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:26.970> use

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
hand and now what you want to do is use

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
hand and now what you want to do is use
your<00:02:27.180> thumb<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.690> push<00:02:27.960> through<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.500> section

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
your thumb to push through and section

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.330 
your thumb to push through and section
the<00:02:29.130> hair<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.060> opposite<00:02:30.510> way<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.560> two

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the hair in the opposite way so the two

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
the hair in the opposite way so the two
sections<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:33.150> split<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.840> different<00:02:34.230> way<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
sections get split in a different way so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.680 
sections get split in a different way so
if<00:02:34.740> your<00:02:34.890> hair<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.280> put<00:02:35.520> together<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.450> way

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
if your hair is put together this way

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.870 
if your hair is put together this way
then<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> want<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.620> split<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.460> way<00:02:38.670> if

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
then you want to split it that way if

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880 
then you want to split it that way if
that<00:02:39.030> makes<00:02:39.270> sense<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.720> hopefully<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.800> can

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that makes sense so hopefully you can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.290 
that makes sense so hopefully you can
see<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.610> pushing<00:02:41.760> my<00:02:42.000> thumb

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
see it but I'm just pushing my thumb

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.240 
see it but I'm just pushing my thumb
through<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:45.170> splitting<00:02:46.170> those<00:02:46.440> two<00:02:46.770> sections

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
through and splitting those two sections

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.980 
through and splitting those two sections
in<00:02:47.460> half<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:48.060> create<00:02:48.090> another<00:02:48.750> two<00:02:49.080> sections

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
in half to create another two sections

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.880 
in half to create another two sections
like<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> twist<00:02:53.190> again<00:02:54.890> towards

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
like so and then you twist again towards

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.260 
like so and then you twist again towards
each<00:02:56.040> other<00:02:58.820> bring<00:02:59.820> them<00:02:59.970> together<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.970> use

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
each other bring them together and use

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.900 
each other bring them together and use
your<00:03:03.450> thumb<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.810> push<00:03:03.930> through<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.910> section

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
your thumb to push through and section

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.410 
your thumb to push through and section
them<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.330> half

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:31.410 

and<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> game<00:03:14.380> twist

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.199 

push<00:03:32.050> them<00:03:32.230> together<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.950> pull<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> pot

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 

and<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.870> continue<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.409> all<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.709> way<00:03:41.010> down

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
and you continue this all the way down

00:03:41.340 --> 00:04:18.920 
and you continue this all the way down
you<00:03:41.549> hear

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.140 

I'm<00:04:19.769> gonna<00:04:19.949> stop<00:04:20.250> about<00:04:20.489> there<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:21.000> I'm<00:04:21.090> just

I'm gonna stop about there and I'm just
gonna<00:04:21.359> take<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.600> small<00:04:22.019> clear<00:04:22.470> hair<00:04:22.680> tie<00:04:22.889> and

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
gonna take a small clear hair tie and

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:31.540 
gonna take a small clear hair tie and
tie<00:04:24.449> it<00:04:24.509> off

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.909 

and<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:32.960> as<00:04:33.139> you<00:04:33.259> can<00:04:33.349> see<00:04:33.530> it's<00:04:33.650> pretty<00:04:33.800> much

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
and that as you can see it's pretty much

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.740 
and that as you can see it's pretty much
the<00:04:34.190> bulk<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.729> hair<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> get<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.629> little

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
the bulk of the hair so I get a little

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.820 
the bulk of the hair so I get a little
bit<00:04:35.990> closer

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
bit closer

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.820 
bit closer
it<00:04:37.370> looks<00:04:37.699> like<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.569> braid<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.590> haven't

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
it looks like a braid but you haven't

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.409 
it looks like a braid but you haven't
actually<00:04:40.159> braided<00:04:40.789> their<00:04:40.909> hair<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.240> then<00:04:41.330> you

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
actually braided their hair and then you

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.390 
actually braided their hair and then you
can<00:04:41.569> just<00:04:41.720> loosen<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.259> bit<00:04:42.440> pull<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.770> out<00:04:42.919> the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
can just loosen it a bit pull it out the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.529 
can just loosen it a bit pull it out the
great<00:04:43.580> thing<00:04:43.699> about<00:04:43.759> this<00:04:43.970> hairstyles<00:04:44.449> it

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
great thing about this hairstyles it

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.029 
great thing about this hairstyles it
does<00:04:44.659> move<00:04:44.810> have<00:04:45.110> layers<00:04:45.379> and<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.650> have<00:04:45.800> bits

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
does move have layers and you have bits

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.610 
does move have layers and you have bits
poking<00:04:46.550> out<00:04:46.729> because<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.750> just<00:04:48.050> adds<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.440> I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
poking out because it just adds to I

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.800 
poking out because it just adds to I
guess<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.069> messiness<00:04:49.550> of<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:49.849> look<00:04:50.030> at<00:04:50.599> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
guess the messiness of the look at the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.230 
guess the messiness of the look at the
back<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.199> will<00:04:51.620> use<00:04:52.009> a<00:04:52.039> bobby<00:04:52.340> pin<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.879> to<00:04:53.000> pin

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
back I will use a bobby pin just to pin

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.210 
back I will use a bobby pin just to pin
it<00:04:53.360> up<00:04:53.690> because<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.470> find<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.949> short

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
it up because I find that the short

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.619 
it up because I find that the short
pieces<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.699> side<00:04:55.909> might<00:04:56.150> not<00:04:56.330> make<00:04:56.509> it

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
pieces on this side might not make it

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.360 
pieces on this side might not make it
all<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.810> way<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.229> side<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:58.159> I'm<00:04:58.280> just

this to the back of the hair as well I'm
gonna<00:05:09.620> pull<00:05:09.830> out<00:05:09.919> some<00:05:10.069> pieces<00:05:10.250> on<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.550> side

gonna pull out some pieces on the side

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.999 
gonna pull out some pieces on the side
just<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.120> make<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:12.080> frame<00:05:12.259> my<00:05:12.470> face<00:05:12.680> and

just to make it to frame my face and

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.219 
just to make it to frame my face and

just make it look a little bit more

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.240 
just make it look a little bit more
relaxed<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.949> guess<00:05:17.380> that<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.500> basically<00:05:18.949> it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
relaxed I guess that is basically it

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.850 
relaxed I guess that is basically it
like<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> said<00:05:19.819> under<00:05:20.599> five<00:05:20.780> minutes<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.349> do<00:05:21.500> it

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
like I said under five minutes to do it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.459 
like I said under five minutes to do it
just<00:05:22.159> looks<00:05:22.639> really<00:05:23.000> cute<00:05:23.449> really<00:05:23.659> fun<00:05:24.020> it<00:05:24.259> has

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
just looks really cute really fun it has

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.459 
just looks really cute really fun it has
definitely<00:05:24.919> that<00:05:25.360> boho<00:05:26.360> you're<00:05:26.599> messy<00:05:27.080> yes

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
definitely that boho you're messy yes

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.379 
definitely that boho you're messy yes
kind<00:05:27.979> of<00:05:28.099> look<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.699> really<00:05:28.969> like<00:05:29.180> that

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
kind of look to it I really like that

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.240 
kind of look to it I really like that
and<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.659> think<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.020> works<00:05:30.259> well<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.620> most

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
and I think it works well and most

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.409 
and I think it works well and most
people<00:05:31.550> can<00:05:31.669> pull<00:05:31.789> it<00:05:31.909> off<00:05:31.969> and<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.240> great

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
people can pull it off and the great

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.820 
people can pull it off and the great
thing<00:05:32.599> about<00:05:32.719> it<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.020> if<00:05:33.169> you<00:05:33.199> have<00:05:33.289> curly<00:05:33.800> hair

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
thing about it is if you have curly hair

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.589 
thing about it is if you have curly hair
if<00:05:34.069> you<00:05:34.159> have<00:05:34.190> straight<00:05:34.610> hair<00:05:34.639> second<00:05:35.449> day

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
if you have straight hair second day

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.700 
if you have straight hair second day
hair<00:05:35.810> it<00:05:36.020> doesn't<00:05:36.289> matter<00:05:36.409> if<00:05:36.469> it's<00:05:36.560> got<00:05:36.680> a

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
hair it doesn't matter if it's got a

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.870 
hair it doesn't matter if it's got a
little<00:05:36.860> bit<00:05:36.949> of<00:05:37.039> texture<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.550> or<00:05:37.729> if<00:05:37.789> it's

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
little bit of texture to it or if it's

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.580 
little bit of texture to it or if it's
dead<00:05:38.060> straight<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.690> can<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:39.199> might<00:05:39.349> have<00:05:39.469> to

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
dead straight you can you might have to

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.930 
dead straight you can you might have to
pull<00:05:39.889> around<00:05:40.190> with<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.460> little<00:05:40.520> bit<00:05:40.639> more<00:05:40.880> of

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
pull around with it a little bit more of

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.219 
pull around with it a little bit more of
its<00:05:41.060> dead<00:05:41.240> straight<00:05:41.539> but<00:05:41.659> you<00:05:41.719> can<00:05:41.870> still<00:05:42.080> get

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
its dead straight but you can still get

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.629 
its dead straight but you can still get
that<00:05:42.259> messy<00:05:42.710> kind<00:05:43.009> of<00:05:43.099> look<00:05:43.219> because<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.550> the

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
that messy kind of look because of the

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.040 
that messy kind of look because of the
twisting<00:05:44.060> and<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.240> pulling<00:05:44.509> the<00:05:44.599> hair<00:05:44.780> apart

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
twisting and the pulling the hair apart

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.809 
twisting and the pulling the hair apart
and<00:05:45.349> that<00:05:45.469> because<00:05:46.009> you<00:05:46.130> didn't<00:05:46.370> brush<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.729> out

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
and that because you didn't brush it out

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.459 
and that because you didn't brush it out
too<00:05:47.060> much<00:05:47.210> that'll<00:05:47.569> add<00:05:47.719> to<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.050> texture<00:05:48.349> of

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
too much that'll add to the texture of

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.469 
too much that'll add to the texture of
your<00:05:48.560> hair<00:05:48.800> also<00:05:49.009> and<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:50.090> think<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.360> could

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
your hair also and I think you could

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.430 
your hair also and I think you could
probably<00:05:50.630> finish<00:05:50.840> off<00:05:51.020> with<00:05:51.080> a<00:05:51.139> little<00:05:51.319> bit<00:05:51.409> of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
probably finish off with a little bit of

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.170 
probably finish off with a little bit of
hairspray<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:51.919> spritz<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.759> just<00:05:52.940> sort<00:05:53.120> of

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
hairspray and spritz it just sort of

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.399 
hairspray and spritz it just sort of
stay<00:05:53.419> in<00:05:53.630> especially<00:05:54.050> if<00:05:54.139> you're<00:05:54.229> going<00:05:54.319> to

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
wear it to school but other than that

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.180 
wear it to school but other than that
