the<00:01:15.690> first<00:01:15.930> thing<00:01:16.050> we're<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.590> with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the first thing we're going to do with

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.970 
the first thing we're going to do with
the<00:01:16.920> teddy<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.190> remove<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.790> black<00:01:18.030> outline

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
the teddy is remove this black outline

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.140 
the teddy is remove this black outline
so<00:01:19.980> I'm<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> very

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so I'm just going to do that very

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
so I'm just going to do that very
quickly<00:01:21.330> by<00:01:21.690> selecting<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.350> black<00:01:22.830> color

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
quickly by selecting the black color

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
quickly by selecting the black color
because<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> only<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.300> that's<00:01:24.510> black

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because it's the only thing that's black

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.290 
because it's the only thing that's black
in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.050> design<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.850> hit<00:01:27.030> my

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
in the design and then I can hit my

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.580 
in the design and then I can hit my
delete<00:01:27.360> button<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.230> that<00:01:28.980> removes<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:31.530> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
delete button and that removes it now we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.040 
delete button and that removes it now we
do<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.800> some<00:01:32.010> gaps<00:01:32.370> down<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.840> don't

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
do have some gaps down here but don't

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.180 
do have some gaps down here but don't
worry<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.290> those<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:35.010> going<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
worry about those because we're going to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.980 
worry about those because we're going to
cover<00:01:35.430> those<00:01:35.550> up<00:01:35.760> with<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.180> outfit

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.110 

now<00:01:39.990> we're<00:01:40.260> going<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.590> digitize<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.550> suit

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
now we're going to digitize the suit

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.650 
now we're going to digitize the suit
first<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.300> want<00:01:45.480> to<00:01:45.540> do

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
first and to do that what I want to do

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.660 
first and to do that what I want to do
is<00:01:45.900> remove<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.410> stitching<00:01:47.070> underneath<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
is remove the stitching underneath the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.570 
is remove the stitching underneath the
suit<00:01:47.910> so<00:01:48.720> although<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.830> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.160> make<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> an

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
suit so although I'm going to make it an

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.520 
suit so although I'm going to make it an
applique<00:01:51.030> suit<00:01:51.420> I'm<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.080> start<00:01:52.350> by

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
applique suit I'm going to start by

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.680 
applique suit I'm going to start by
digitizing<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.220> closed<00:01:53.490> object<00:01:54.000> filled<00:01:54.300> shape

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
digitizing a closed object filled shape

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.500 
digitizing a closed object filled shape
so<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.080> can<00:01:55.320> use<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.890> remove<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:57.090> stitching

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
so I can use it to remove the stitching

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.770 
so I can use it to remove the stitching

the<00:02:17.390> circle<00:02:17.689> room<00:02:17.810> because<00:02:18.079> all<00:02:18.230> turned<00:02:18.560> green

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
the circle room because all turned green

because I want to make this suit an

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.930 
because I want to make this suit an
applique<00:04:15.650> because<00:04:15.979> it's<00:04:16.130> such<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.310> large<00:04:16.609> area

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.209 
click node and then drag this up that
will<00:06:47.050> allow<00:06:47.289> me<00:06:47.499> to<00:06:48.179> get<00:06:49.179> that<00:06:49.389> straighter

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
will allow me to get that straighter

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:55.799 
will allow me to get that straighter
just<00:06:51.219> a<00:06:51.369> little<00:06:51.579> bit<00:06:51.669> more<00:06:53.999> that's<00:06:54.999> better<00:06:55.269> so

00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:55.809 
just a little bit more that's better so

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:57.929 
just a little bit more that's better so
it<00:06:55.869> covers<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.349> end<00:06:56.529> there<00:06:56.949> let's<00:06:57.610> just<00:06:57.789> go

00:06:57.929 --> 00:06:57.939 
it covers the end there let's just go

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:01.109 
it covers the end there let's just go
across<00:06:58.089> to<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.389> other<00:06:58.539> side<00:06:59.669> it's<00:07:00.669> not<00:07:00.939> too

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:01.119 
across to the other side it's not too

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:08.969

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:14.829 
and this is built now we saw that it

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:16.499 
and this is built now we saw that it
went<00:07:14.979> over<00:07:15.159> the<00:07:15.279> red<00:07:15.489> stitching<00:07:15.939> there<00:07:16.149> so

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:19.959 
we'll select the belt again and just

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:23.309 
we'll select the belt again and just
remove<00:07:20.289> overlaps<00:07:20.799> as<00:07:21.009> well<00:07:21.659> and<00:07:22.659> if<00:07:22.779> i<00:07:22.899> zoom<00:07:22.929> in

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
remove overlaps as well and if i zoom in

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:27.139

there<00:07:23.499> for<00:07:23.769> you<00:07:23.889> just<00:07:23.919> so<00:07:24.279> you<00:07:24.309> can<00:07:24.759> see<00:07:24.969> that

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:27.149 
there for you just so you can see that

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:29.850 
there for you just so you can see that
you<00:07:28.149> can<00:07:28.299> see<00:07:28.539> that<00:07:28.809> the<00:07:28.899> red<00:07:29.110> stitching<00:07:29.619> has

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
you can see that the red stitching has

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.929 
you can see that the red stitching has
been<00:07:30.159> cut<00:07:30.429> away<00:07:30.579> not<00:07:31.059> completely<00:07:31.659> because

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:32.939 
been cut away not completely because

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.669 
been cut away not completely because
that<00:07:33.939> they<00:07:34.179> allow<00:07:34.479> for<00:07:34.509> some<00:07:34.899> overlap<00:07:35.379> so<00:07:35.649> that

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:35.679 
that they allow for some overlap so that

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:39.449 
that they allow for some overlap so that
there<00:07:36.429> are<00:07:36.549> no<00:07:36.669> gaps<00:07:37.049> but<00:07:38.049> we<00:07:38.439> won't<00:07:38.860> have<00:07:39.099> come

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:39.459 
there are no gaps but we won't have come

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.489 
there are no gaps but we won't have come
one<00:07:40.329> big<00:07:40.539> lump<00:07:40.719> there<00:07:40.959> where<00:07:41.110> we've<00:07:41.259> stitched

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:41.499 
one big lump there where we've stitched

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:51.430 
one big lump there where we've stitched
over<00:07:41.739> the<00:07:42.009> red<00:07:42.189> stitching<00:07:42.719> entirely

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440
