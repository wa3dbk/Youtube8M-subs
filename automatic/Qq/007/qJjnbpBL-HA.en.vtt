I'm not really pressing that hard okay

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.749 
I'm not really pressing that hard okay
if<00:01:34.780> you're<00:01:34.960> really<00:01:35.229> pressing<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.160> digging<00:01:36.580> in

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
if you're really pressing and digging in

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.779 
if you're really pressing and digging in
that<00:01:37.149> means<00:01:37.780> you're<00:01:37.930> doing<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.380> wrong<00:01:38.560> okay

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
that means you're doing it wrong okay

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.859 
that means you're doing it wrong okay
the<00:01:40.060> further<00:01:40.500> away<00:01:41.500> from<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.190> fret<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
the further away from the fret for the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.840 
the further away from the fret for the
notes<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.320> I'm<00:01:44.440> trying<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.770> do<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
notes that I'm trying to do you have to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.639 
notes that I'm trying to do you have to
end<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.179> pressing<00:01:46.390> harder<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.110> get<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.380> notes

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
end up pressing harder to get the notes

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.609 
end up pressing harder to get the notes
out<00:01:47.830> because<00:01:48.130> what's<00:01:48.910> making<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> note<00:01:49.720> play

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
out because what's making the note play

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.680 
out because what's making the note play
is<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:52.000> fretting<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.200> below<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.679> fret

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.100 

okay<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:58.899> if<00:01:59.140> you're<00:01:59.289> pressing<00:01:59.560> really<00:01:59.920> hard

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
okay so if you're pressing really hard

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.199 
okay so if you're pressing really hard
that<00:02:02.110> means<00:02:02.319> you're<00:02:02.560> doing<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:02.979> wrong<00:02:03.250> okay<00:02:03.880> so

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
that means you're doing it wrong okay so

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.979 
that means you're doing it wrong okay so
nice<00:02:04.599> and<00:02:04.869> easy<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.940> next<00:02:07.239> thing<00:02:07.479> we're<00:02:07.810> going

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
nice and easy the next thing we're going

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.900 
nice and easy the next thing we're going
to<00:02:08.110> do<00:02:08.319> now<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.860> we're<00:02:09.160> going<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.700> learn

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
to do now is we're going to go and learn

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.380 
to do now is we're going to go and learn
another<00:02:10.239> chord<00:02:10.630> okay<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:12.520> said<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> last

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

particular<00:03:17.080> chords<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.680> because<00:03:18.040> what<00:03:18.250> we're

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
particular chords is because what we're

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.390 
particular chords is because what we're
going<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.700> be<00:03:18.849> doing<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.330> we're<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.660> be

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
going to be doing is we're going to be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.070 
going to be doing is we're going to be
long<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.700> learned<00:03:21.970> when<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.209> was<00:03:22.450> just

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
long that I learned when I was just

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.320 
long that I learned when I was just
starting<00:03:23.230> out<00:03:23.680> playing<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.310> it's<00:03:24.760> really

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
starting out playing and it's really

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.839 
starting out playing and it's really
pretty<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.380> you're<00:03:27.099> going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.400> able<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.700> do

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
pretty and you're going to be able to do

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.970 
pretty and you're going to be able to do
it<00:03:27.970> because<00:03:28.120> they're<00:03:28.330> very<00:03:28.540> easy<00:03:28.780> chords<00:03:29.319> so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
it because they're very easy chords so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.550 
it because they're very easy chords so
now<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:31.330> picking<00:03:31.840> pattern<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.410> we

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
now with that picking pattern that we

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.100 
now with that picking pattern that we
originally<00:03:33.069> learned<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.599> from<00:03:34.840> let

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
originally learned and this is from let

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.770 
originally learned and this is from let
me<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.410> try<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:36.040> camera<00:03:36.780> situated

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
me just try to get this camera situated

lesson number one below again and work
on<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.569> pattern<00:04:33.900> first<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.800> then<00:04:35.340> when

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
on that pattern first and then when

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.710 
on that pattern first and then when
you're<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.419> know<00:04:36.569> you<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:36.990> play<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.690> know

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
you're you know you can play it you know

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.850 
you're you know you can play it you know
would<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.020> this

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.360 

when<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.430> could<00:04:45.610> play<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:45.940> fairly<00:04:46.240> fast<00:04:47.370> you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
when you could play it fairly fast you

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.430 
when you could play it fairly fast you
know<00:04:48.490> like<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.880> tempo<00:04:49.270> maybe<00:04:49.570> even<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.170> little

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
know like that tempo maybe even a little

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
know like that tempo maybe even a little
slower<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:50.920> fine<00:04:51.190> then<00:04:52.000> come<00:04:52.030> back<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.660> this

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
slower is fine then come back to this

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.870 
slower is fine then come back to this
lesson<00:04:53.260> okay<00:04:53.800> but<00:04:54.070> important<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.640> you<00:04:54.730> get
