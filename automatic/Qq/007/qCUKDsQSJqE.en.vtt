00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
have more radiator support if you are

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.209 
have more radiator support if you are
interested<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.050> water<00:00:34.260> cooling<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.770> some

this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> feature<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.660> fan

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this is going to feature a fan

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
this is going to feature a fan
controller<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.800> also<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> ship

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
controller and it's also going to ship

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
controller and it's also going to ship
with<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.300> fans<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> general<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> X<00:00:49.559> 3

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
with more fans in general than the X 3

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
with more fans in general than the X 3
series<00:00:50.280> apart<00:00:50.850> from<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.360> x5<00:00:52.050> series<00:00:52.440> has

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
series apart from that the x5 series has

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.819 
series apart from that the x5 series has
a<00:00:52.710> different<00:00:53.510> hard<00:00:54.510> drive<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.930> SSD<00:00:55.289> mounting

solution<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.670> trays

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
solution so you're going to have trays

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
solution so you're going to have trays
rather<00:00:57.510> than<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> vertical<00:00:58.320> panels<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
rather than the vertical panels and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
rather than the vertical panels and
you're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> course<00:01:00.030> throughout

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
you're going to see of course throughout

wind old side panel if you're interested
in<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.820> again<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.840> hard<00:01:46.110> drive

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
in that and again you have hard drive

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.850 
in that and again you have hard drive

inch<00:01:50.070> drive<00:01:50.310> mounts<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.540> full

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
inch drive mounts and you have full

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
inch drive mounts and you have full
radiator<00:01:52.350> support<00:01:52.560> again<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.340> well<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
radiator support again as well as a

wider<00:01:54.630> width<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
wider width on this so you're going to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.959 
wider width on this so you're going to
have<00:01:55.829> plenty<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.340> room<00:01:56.549> behind<00:01:56.759> the

you're<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> larger<00:02:16.440> size<00:02:16.560> radiator

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
you're going for a larger size radiator

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
you're going for a larger size radiator
or<00:02:17.310> an<00:02:17.700> offset<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> sets<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> little

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
or an offset one that sets it a little

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
or an offset one that sets it a little

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
bit further away from the motherboard so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.820 
bit further away from the motherboard so
you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> accommodate<00:02:21.600> larger<00:02:22.170> heat<00:02:22.380> sinks<00:02:22.680> or

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
you can accommodate larger heat sinks or

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.680 
you can accommodate larger heat sinks or
that<00:02:23.130> sort<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> thing<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.850> also<00:02:24.150> as<00:02:24.360> far<00:02:24.420> as

that sort of thing and also as far as
