00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.610 
divine by design today I'm going to be
looking<00:00:12.969> at<00:00:13.180> how<00:00:13.269> to<00:00:13.299> produce<00:00:13.540> a<00:00:13.840> matte<00:00:14.139> effect

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
looking at how to produce a matte effect

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.620 
looking at how to produce a matte effect
shellac<00:00:14.980> now<00:00:15.820> this<00:00:16.119> is<00:00:16.270> quite<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.480> simple

shellac now this is quite a simple
process<00:00:16.810> but<00:00:17.320> there<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.529> technique<00:00:17.890> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
process but there is a technique to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.640 
process but there is a technique to
producing<00:00:19.240> it<00:00:19.420> which<00:00:19.600> won't<00:00:19.930> affect<00:00:20.380> the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
producing it which won't affect the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.279 
producing it which won't affect the
longevity<00:00:21.160> of<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:21.609> service<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.330> still<00:00:23.109> gives

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
longevity of the service and still gives

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.200 
longevity of the service and still gives
a<00:00:23.380> really<00:00:23.740> great<00:00:23.919> effect<00:00:24.249> I'm<00:00:24.699> going<00:00:25.060> to<00:00:25.119> be

towards the end of the free edge here I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.520 
towards the end of the free edge here I
don't<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:43.349> still

quite<00:02:43.769> glossy<00:02:44.190> there<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:45.180> want<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> make<00:02:45.630> sure

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
quite glossy there you want to make sure

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.330 
quite glossy there you want to make sure
that<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.140> go<00:02:46.319> up<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> edge<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.160> free

because<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.160> will<00:02:50.430> break<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> seal<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.599> that

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
because you will break the seal and that

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.360 
because you will break the seal and that
will<00:02:52.230> cause<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.709> shellac<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> lift

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
will cause your shellac to lift

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.420 
will cause your shellac to lift
prematurely<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.650> very<00:02:55.859> gently<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:58.430> file

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
prematurely so very gently just file

prematurely so very gently just file
round<00:02:59.760> once<00:03:00.480> you've<00:03:00.660> done<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.109> can<00:03:01.230> see

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
round once you've done that you can see

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.110 
round once you've done that you can see
it's<00:03:01.620> quite<00:03:01.980> powdery<00:03:02.340> compared<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.030> the

it's quite powdery compared to the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.650 
it's quite powdery compared to the
others<00:03:03.799> take<00:03:04.799> your<00:03:04.980> pad<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.430> you're<00:03:06.000> 99%

isopropyl alcohol and just wipe it down
now<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:11.639> need<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.850> give<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.120> couple<00:03:12.329> of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
now we need to give that a couple of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.300 
now we need to give that a couple of
seconds<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.170> once<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.680> dry<00:03:13.829> we'll<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:14.220> able

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
seconds and once it's dry we'll be able

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.949 
seconds and once it's dry we'll be able
to<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.579> if<00:03:14.639> we've<00:03:14.760> got<00:03:14.880> any<00:03:15.000> shiny<00:03:15.209> patches<00:03:15.450> it

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
to see if we've got any shiny patches it

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.759 
to see if we've got any shiny patches it
started<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.470> dry<00:03:16.620> now<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.620> see

thing<00:03:28.109> is<00:03:28.410> check<00:03:28.799> your<00:03:28.829> file<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.579> you're<00:03:29.700> doing

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
thing is check your file as you're doing

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.059 
thing is check your file as you're doing
this<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:31.079> should<00:03:31.500> be<00:03:31.739> showing<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.599> white

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
this it should be showing a white

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.099 
this it should be showing a white
residue<00:03:35.069> if<00:03:35.310> there's<00:03:35.849> any<00:03:36.090> color<00:03:36.510> whatsoever

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
residue if there's any color whatsoever

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.740 
residue if there's any color whatsoever
to<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.670> will<00:03:38.819> actually<00:03:39.510> mean<00:03:39.720> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
to it then it will actually mean that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.750 
to it then it will actually mean that
you've<00:03:40.019> gone<00:03:40.230> through<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.980> topcoat<00:03:41.549> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you've gone through the topcoat and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.729 
you've gone through the topcoat and
you've<00:03:42.569> gone<00:03:42.720> through<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.170> color<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you've gone through to the color if you

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.289 
you've gone through to the color if you
do<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.370> will<00:03:44.519> need<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.849> give<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.150> meal

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
do that you will need to give the meal

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.970 
do that you will need to give the meal
to<00:03:45.420> clean<00:03:45.540> down<00:03:45.840> with<00:03:46.019> some<00:03:46.170> scrub<00:03:46.440> fresh<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
to clean down with some scrub fresh and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.059 
to clean down with some scrub fresh and
reapply<00:03:47.910> two<00:03:48.419> top<00:03:48.750> coats<00:03:49.079> unless<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:50.040> course

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
reapply two top coats unless of course

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.289 
reapply two top coats unless of course
you've<00:03:50.370> gone<00:03:50.459> completely<00:03:50.700> through<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> color

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
you've gone completely through the color

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.490 
you've gone completely through the color
coat<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.630> then<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.750> would<00:03:51.989> need<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.200> start

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
coat and then you would need to start

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
coat and then you would need to start
afresh<00:03:52.739> then<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.910> where<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
afresh then so this is where it's a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.120 
afresh then so this is where it's a
simple<00:03:54.930> process<00:03:55.109> but<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:56.040> be

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
simple process but you do have to be

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.009 
simple process but you do have to be
careful<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.459> your<00:03:56.579> technique<00:03:56.940> now<00:03:57.750> just

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
careful with your technique now just

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.509 
careful with your technique now just
another<00:03:58.139> option<00:03:58.410> here<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.159> other<00:03:59.250> side

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
another option here is on the other side

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.070 
another option here is on the other side
of<00:04:00.860> your<00:04:01.860> koala<00:04:02.370> board<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
of your koala board you have the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.630 
of your koala board you have the
1,200<00:04:06.080> great<00:04:06.230> aside<00:04:06.500> this<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.040> great<00:04:07.430> for

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
1,200 great aside this is great for

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.059 
1,200 great aside this is great for
providing<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.300> sateen<00:04:08.840> effect<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:09.860> at<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
providing a sateen effect so at the

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.190 
providing a sateen effect so at the
moment<00:04:10.370> we've<00:04:10.459> got<00:04:10.580> quite<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.790> matte<00:04:11.090> effect<00:04:11.660> if

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
moment we've got quite a matte effect if

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.400 
moment we've got quite a matte effect if
you<00:04:12.230> want<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.470> provide<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.740> sateen<00:04:13.220> effect<00:04:14.410> you

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
you want to provide a sateen effect you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.410 
you want to provide a sateen effect you
can<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.860> buff<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.430> nail<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:17.120> can<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.390> a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
can just buff the nail it can be a

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.940 
can just buff the nail it can be a
little<00:04:17.959> bit<00:04:18.170> more<00:04:19.130> persuasive<00:04:19.790> with<00:04:19.940> this

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
little bit more persuasive with this

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.140 
little bit more persuasive with this
okay<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.220> finished<00:04:22.400> batting<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:22.910> don't<00:04:23.090> know

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
okay so I finished batting I don't know

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730 
okay so I finished batting I don't know
if<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.300> can<00:04:23.450> see<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.900> difference<00:04:24.260> here<00:04:24.470> but

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
if you can see the difference here but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.560 
if you can see the difference here but
it<00:04:25.220> makes<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.550> color<00:04:25.730> slightly<00:04:26.030> brighter<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
it makes the color slightly brighter and

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.690 
it makes the color slightly brighter and
produces<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.050> more<00:04:27.230> sateen<00:04:27.710> as<00:04:27.980> opposed<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.520> a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
produces a more sateen as opposed to a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.940 
produces a more sateen as opposed to a
matte<00:04:29.390> effect<00:04:29.840> but<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.530> an<00:04:30.620> option<00:04:30.680> for

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
matte effect but that is an option for

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.590 
matte effect but that is an option for
you<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:31.790> what's<00:04:32.000> great<00:04:32.150> when<00:04:32.360> you've<00:04:32.450> done

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600
