00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
GM's goals I've ended three so if you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.990 
GM's goals I've ended three so if you
calculate<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.550> four<00:00:32.790> point

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
calculate that that's like four point
seven<00:00:33.149> percent<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.230> schools<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.620> 20

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
seven percent then these schools are 20

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.090 
seven percent then these schools are 20
percent<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.870> having<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> worst<00:00:37.710> of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:40.660 
will have these type strands work Ernie
so<00:01:21.560> let's<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.920> luck<00:01:24.590> um<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.610> plot<00:01:32.939> here

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:55.520 

okay<00:01:45.500> all<00:01:46.500> right<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:51.390> gone<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:54.539> if<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
okay all right so it's gone so if the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
okay all right so it's gone so if the
scroll<00:01:56.220> fails<00:01:56.789> it'll<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> message<00:01:58.320> down
