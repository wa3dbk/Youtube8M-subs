00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone my name is bad fame 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome to a new video in which 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.000
 as you can see, my face is seen once more and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.179
 I'm adapting too much I think 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 this to show my face is good but 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.640
 I have the news to give you so 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 well they preferred not to upload a comment and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 talk about a game of yushu word or 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.269
 is to talk about the topic this on a part 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.859
 of the software I wanted to raise my face 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 first of all to take advantage of a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 little bit and you those people who sent me 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.070
 messages say they told me that they 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 liked the background of the new background in my 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.740
 channel and the avatar and a lot and tells them that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.650
 they liked it in general 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.930
 I wanted to be the light that was that 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.260
 did all the bottom of my channel did the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 avatar 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.989
 the truth that is a beast is great 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.539
 making graphics and other the truth that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.660
 It's very, very good, I always tell you 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.270

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.900
 I thanked thousands of times writing 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.540
 well I think that each face is left with a 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.800
 little bit more as if it were more 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.040

 and now I'm going to talk, I 'm going 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.270
 head I think about butterflies 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 roses of yellow colors and I forget 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.980

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 people answered good on twitter if 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.420
 I will continue to protest because the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.189
 sad I have on the mobile 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.290
 in the background with twitter there so 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.729
 he is answering, he does not have to 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.350
 be at home to answer that so 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.440
 I have no excuse and I have to answer 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.930
 all on twitter that talk to me 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.490
 and good the facebook ones I'm not going to 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.660
 being on facebook was a bit on 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.370
 the mobile so I'm not going to be much 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.110
 good that I'm not going to be the end of 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.940
 week I will not be from Friday to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.070
 the afternoon until the following Monday 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 but I'm going to let the video go up for 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 upload I'm going to leave it there saved that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
 they will go up through the same time 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.870
 that those who upload the videos and although 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.330
 are from 5 to 7 of the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.280
 more or less from here of Spain ' 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.900
 I do not know what time it would be in Mexico 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 I think it's like 12 o'clock in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.240
 the one p.m. a thing 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.630
 from 11 to one more or less 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.220
 I'm not too sure why I do not like it 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 say with certainty 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.840
 good was that and also tell them that 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.280

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.340

 as well as I'm right now live to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.910
 answer questions that ask me what 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.890
 that you want because they left 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.480
 many jazz themes meant I was 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 talking and there are many things that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.090
 talk so I'm going to take that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.650
 moment to talk about this was all and we 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.650
