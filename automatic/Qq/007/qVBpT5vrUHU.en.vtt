00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
boom here we go butter so we do it from

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
boom here we go butter so we do it from
this<00:01:35.610> angle<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.210> we've<00:01:36.390> got<00:01:36.420> our<00:01:36.630> GM

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
this angle here we've got our GM

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.039 
this angle here we've got our GM
amplifier<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> year<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.930> well

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
amplifier that was out this year as well

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.520 
amplifier that was out this year as well
so<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.500> GM<00:01:41.040> dash<00:01:41.810> 6500<00:01:42.810> s<00:01:42.990> there's<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> full

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so a GM dash 6500 s there's a full

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
so a GM dash 6500 s there's a full
channel<00:01:43.890> amplifier<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.270> powering

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
channel amplifier and that's powering

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
channel amplifier and that's powering
the<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> system<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> six<00:01:47.369> by

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the kind of system here so the six by

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.620 
the kind of system here so the six by
nine<00:01:47.549> czar<00:01:47.850> running<00:01:48.060> off<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.210> head<00:01:48.420> unit

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
nine czar running off the head unit

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
nine czar running off the head unit
which<00:01:49.290> 1i<00:01:49.530> 102<00:01:49.979> yeah<00:01:50.280> we've<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.759> six<00:01:50.939> bow

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
which 1i 102 yeah we've got some six bow

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
which 1i 102 yeah we've got some six bow
lines<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:51.390> TSA<00:01:51.780> 6<00:01:52.049> by<00:01:52.170> lines<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.740> as

well there they are the TSA 696 bow

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
well there they are the TSA 696 bow
lines<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.710> we've

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
lines on a three way there as well we've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
lines on a three way there as well we've
got<00:01:59.490> our<00:01:59.610> t<00:02:00.000> SW<00:02:01.490> 309<00:02:02.490> s<00:02:02.759> forces<00:02:03.420> 12<00:02:03.780> inch<00:02:04.020> sub

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
got our t SW 309 s forces 12 inch sub

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
got our t SW 309 s forces 12 inch sub
again<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.460> only<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:05.670> 85<00:02:06.119> pounds<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.689> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
again it's only about 85 pounds but it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.460 
again it's only about 85 pounds but it's
real<00:02:07.350> great<00:02:07.680> sound<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
real great sound for what it is

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.440 
real great sound for what it is
it's<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.520> seems<00:02:11.060> your<00:02:11.180> approach

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
it's in it it seems your approach

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.280 
it's in it it seems your approach
quietly<00:02:11.630> very<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:14.120> then<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.870> amp<00:02:14.990> runs

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
quietly very very and then the amp runs

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.410 
quietly very very and then the amp runs
the<00:02:15.770> front<00:02:16.100> components<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:16.970> sub<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the front components and the sub and the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
the front components and the sub and the
six<00:02:17.570> miles<00:02:17.810> off<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.020> head<00:02:18.260> unit<00:02:18.470> right<00:02:18.860> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
six miles off the head unit right it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.560 
six miles off the head unit right it
controls<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.580> all<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.000> got<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
controls it all so it's got all of the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.570 
controls it all so it's got all of the
EQ<00:02:20.990> settings<00:02:21.230> all<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.860> processing<00:02:22.400> power

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
EQ settings all of the processing power

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.390 
EQ settings all of the processing power
to<00:02:23.330> rebuild<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.260> system<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.800> get<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> most<00:02:25.160> out

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to rebuild a system and get the most out

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.510 
to rebuild a system and get the most out
of<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.700> Lee's<00:02:26.630> built<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> system<00:02:27.110> himself<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
of it Lee's built the system himself so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.340 
of it Lee's built the system himself so
is<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.970> know<00:02:29.060> again<00:02:29.540> put<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.990> Pioneer

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
is you know again put the Pioneer

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.630 
is you know again put the Pioneer
products<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.950> right<00:02:31.160> way<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.370> can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
products in the right way you can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.340 
products in the right way you can
maximize<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.330> sound<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.840> when<00:02:32.930> he<00:02:32.990> takes<00:02:33.200> it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
maximize the sound and when he takes it

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.140 
maximize the sound and when he takes it
to<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.500> cruises<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.280> goes<00:02:34.460> to<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> events

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
to the cruises and it goes to the events

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.760 
to the cruises and it goes to the events
it<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:35.990> really<00:02:36.140> does<00:02:36.350> have<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.590> great

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
it really really does have a great

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.220 
it really really does have a great
impact<00:02:36.950> people<00:02:37.850> love<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.480> sound<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.960> car

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
impact people love the sound of this car

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.220 
impact people love the sound of this car
I<00:02:39.830> think<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.330> iphone<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.660> very

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
I think that this is the iphone is very

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.740 
I think that this is the iphone is very
