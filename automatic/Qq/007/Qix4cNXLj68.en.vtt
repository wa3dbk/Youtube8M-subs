00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.029
 friends to a short europe 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 universalist 4 update i wanted the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.420
 take time and a little bit on 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.980
 your comments and suggestions in more detail 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.500
 to enter and a little something 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 to say how to do it with norway 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 also can play what it is there for 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 there are alternatives and so on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.920
 on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.380
 first , of course, was very big 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 thank you to all the comments 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.320
 that left so many 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.640
 I probably do now 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 not a complete list 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.449
 but the seventh dwarf has me very much 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 Many thanks to you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.180
 of course at this point alpha 34 88 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 helped me a lot thank you too 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.399
 to you then I would like priamos 09 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 07 thanks and of course legendary marvin 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.430
 they are always here for the videos 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 have done time and work around that 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.829
 to comment accordingly 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.350
 yes and because I have a lot in advance 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 had produced that has also easy 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 what to do with it with me 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 currently very stressful and me 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 unfortunately I have to produce in advance 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 Of course not all the amendments 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 implement or suggestions immediately so 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.630
 Again, this video wanted it here and there 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.950
 I'll talk about it again shortly 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.530
 So there were some people who said that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 You could have this personal union with you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 Denmark also bypass that one 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 almost explained the war 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 Sweden conquers these provinces to their core 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 provinces and then with it 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.670
 strengthened against denmark proceeds when 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.390
 I'm not mistaken now 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.979
 but not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.259
 you can not sweden the war 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 explain but you will be in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.220
 diplomacy handled like a vasall man 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 So can only his liege lords 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 declare war 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 that is, to explain the oncoming war 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 you have to get out of this first 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.950
 Personalunion out and it works 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 just about colonial expansion with 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 Norway really good at least at 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 the conquest of paradise is just like that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.040
 I do not know if that 's the case 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.990
 patch 1.4 because just something has changed 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.759
 or if that somehow possible sometime 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 was or if I overlooked something there 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.640
 but as far as I know I still have 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.810
 nachgeguckt times can be difficult to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.649
 war would explain otherwise it would be 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 of course great 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.790
 to choose the administrative ideas 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.710
 To set up many mercenaries sweden 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.540
 conquer 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.520
 you get the administrative ideas 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.570
 yes bonuses in recruitment should 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.120
 or keep etc 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.470
 and then boni gets in the making 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.760
 from nuclear provinces then you could 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.290
 namely go and the Swedish 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.430
 provinces also cheaper in the core 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.260
 provinces and when will the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.320
 administrative an absolute must have 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.030
 for us yes but that does not seem to be true 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.980
 But now go to her again 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.510
 ask how was there namely some 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.810
 People who asked how can you do that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.400
 a personal union dissolve and marvin 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.850
 also had one or two times out 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.670
 answered how that works 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.860
 and that works over it 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 works on two important or 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.340
 let's say three important ways of it 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.590
 Of course, this is the military Wegmann 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.270
 can attack just by the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.550
 dissolve personal union 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:06.530
 You can go and try one 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.600
 negative opinion of the senior partner 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.070
 so if we have a negative one 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.230
 We are of tomorrow when we are 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.870
 a negative opinion of denmark 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 would have been and the king of denmark 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.650
 then it will be dissolved 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.010
 be or now comes opportunities 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.130
 over 3 if denmark a negative 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.260
 then this would be worthy of prestige 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.960
 Personalunion also be resolved if 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.170
 the danish king dies in every case 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.360
 However, Denmark has one 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.420
 recapture reason or a 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.890
 casus belli therefore a war reason around the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.510
 restore union 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.150
 So that's very important 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 we keep in mind because I have yes 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.500
 already said we need money anyway 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.360
 and even if we somehow 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.440
 early from this personal union 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.910
 excrete 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.680
 because the king dies 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.140
 still be that denmark us the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.090
 war explains yes and we have to 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.460
 of course watching sweden watch the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.050
 So it's just next to us 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.610
 It's not that bad when this 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.710
 personal union a bit further 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.910
 is because we are so weak on 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.100
 start and first make money 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.900
 and try to start colonies 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.460
 and thereby get more money and so on 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.620
 on and on 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.290
 and in that there is one more 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.510
 The more frequent one can come with stimulation 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.190
 Norway really well on this 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.850
 Set mercenary ideas 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.170
 It's well worth the mercenary ideas 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.570
 not bad because we are 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.060
 firstly, usually a right 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.230
 have low manpower with 24,000's 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.000
 It does not really have much but we have 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.950
 above all things also a very low one 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.160
 troops limit yes and there are rare there 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.360
 a very good supplement 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.170
 and there are the administrative ideas 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.480
 then very good 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.920
 yes ok I wanted to s.Stelle still 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.290
 let go because that's your suggestion 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.630
 were the more often came 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.100
 I definitely understood how 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.290
 he also means please tell me 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.550
 let me know if it is not 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.880
 possibility gives sweden the war 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.370
 explain I have not found any and 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.480
 otherwise tell me if you are 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.710
 then you have more ideas then write 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.020
 just further below is no 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.220
 problem i read the all attempts too 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.650
 always to answer 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.180
 and at the moment just completely 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.410
 big thank you to all the me 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.810
 because something was written underneath and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.010
 Overall, I have a very good one there 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.320
 get feedback and I would 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.820
 happy if it goes well so because 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.190
 I would like to Europe europa universalis 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.380
 four permanently on my channel like that 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.020
 I would like to do this paradoxical series 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.270
 permanently on a channel as a strategy 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.570
 establish a game there would be more 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.370
 Yes, so to speak as the dead 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.160
 pants and the magic series then said 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.130
 I would have three things that 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.140
 I could show more often and so and and 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.900
 Thanks for your support and it is 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.950
 great if it goes well so 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.110
 yes, then I would say at the place 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.510
 First of all, enough of the good 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.950
 I have nothing now only times to 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.190
 except that again a few 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.510
 Problems with youtube gave but that is yes 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.300
 I'll remember that channel again 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.480
 update and talk about it 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.620
 yes so far let it be good at the place 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.030
 Thank you very much see you next time 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.870
 Couple will do well again 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.580
 bye 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.750
 yes and a thing was important to me 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.930
 I wanted to go into it there 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.730
 it's the one I'll say in 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.920
 quotes Indian peoples with 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.680
 which we will come in contact with 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.410
 our colonial expansion and that is 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.510
 I know that one of those if you 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.860
 with the war leads to one 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.630
 insane payments can demand 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.920
 I know that is possible and that many 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.060
 I personally make myself people 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.990
 decided that I do not 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.120
 will do 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.340
 I think so too, I want that 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.620
 just do not do it 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.320
 although that is probably quite sensible for 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.680
 some people can definitely stop that 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.880
 do 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.010
 On the other side you can see the 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.060
 Of course, as a protectorate 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.570
 set up that always costs only 100 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.430
 So war did not matter how big this one 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.590
 tribe or this culture is now the 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.870
 one submits but that's what I want 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.669
 Actually I do not do it 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.010
 At least I do not have it that way 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.380
 but I know that works and all 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.419
 So you need me then 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.700
 not to point out 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.020
 that would actually have been important 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.980
 I wanted to have mentioned that 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.300
 yes and then I thank you 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.300
 what to look and say is good
