this pretty much was i downloaded I file
from<00:03:29.200> cydia<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:33.380> went<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.800> systems<00:03:34.700> library

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
from cydia and I went to systems library

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.790 
from cydia and I went to systems library
core<00:03:37.010> services<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:39.200> then<00:03:39.320> went<00:03:39.530> all<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> way

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.110 
down to system p lists and then properly
viewer<00:03:48.019> i<00:03:48.350> thought<00:03:49.310> i<00:03:49.400> believe<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.970> was<00:03:50.060> that

and I just renamed the bottom model
number<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.320> then<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.739> six<00:03:55.040> point<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.459> the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
number and then the six point of the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.259 
number and then the six point of the
version<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.989> worked<00:03:57.230> perfectly<00:03:57.680> fine

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
version and it worked perfectly fine
