your television or your computer and you
decided<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.679> take<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.099> bumper<00:00:11.490> sticker

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
decided to take that bumper sticker

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.150 
decided to take that bumper sticker
seriously<00:00:12.690> when<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.929> says<00:00:13.170> shoot<00:00:13.950> your

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
seriously when it says shoot your

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.090 
seriously when it says shoot your
television<00:00:15.560> for<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> sake<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
television for the sake of this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.060 
television for the sake of this
experiment<00:00:17.910> we're<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.260> take<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> cover

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
experiment we're going to take the cover

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040 
experiment we're going to take the cover
off<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> explode<00:00:21.570> when<00:00:21.930> we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
off so we can see it explode when we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.400 
off so we can see it explode when we
shoot<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> we've<00:00:23.189> also<00:00:23.420> done<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> outside<00:00:24.750> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
shoot it we've also done it outside you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.660 
shoot it we've also done it outside you
wouldn't<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.490> living

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
wouldn't want to do this in your living

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
wouldn't want to do this in your living
room<00:00:26.820> unless<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> were<00:00:27.390> real<00:00:27.660> off<00:00:28.199> your

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
room unless you were real off your

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
room unless you were real off your
television<00:00:29.130> set<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
television set because it's going to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.669 
television set because it's going to
make<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> mess

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
make a mess

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
make a mess
this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.009> basic<00:00:32.219> 19<00:00:32.969> inch<00:00:33.210> monitor<00:00:33.300> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this is your basic 19 inch monitor it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
this is your basic 19 inch monitor it's
suffered<00:00:34.739> badly<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> recent<00:00:35.760> lightning

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
suffered badly and a recent lightning

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
suffered badly and a recent lightning
strike<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> perfect<00:00:37.590> victim<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.430> our

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
strike so it's a perfect victim for our

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
strike so it's a perfect victim for our
shooting<00:00:38.969> today<00:00:39.350> one<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> cool<00:00:40.710> things

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
shooting today one of the cool things

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
shooting today one of the cool things
about<00:00:41.129> shooting<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.239> going

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
about shooting this is that we're going

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.660 
about shooting this is that we're going
to<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.110> inside<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.950> CRT

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to get to actually see inside a CRT

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:03.700 
to get to actually see inside a CRT
monitor

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.680 

so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.190> point<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:05.880> precise

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
so I do want to point out how precise

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.660 
so I do want to point out how precise
that<00:01:07.020> first<00:01:07.410> shot<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.280> notice<00:01:08.580> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that first shot was if you notice that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.860 
that first shot was if you notice that
it<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.910> right<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> center<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> screen

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
it was right in the center of the screen

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.690 
it was right in the center of the screen
that's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.200> bad<00:01:10.410> from<00:01:10.620> like<00:01:10.860> 30<00:01:11.190> yards<00:01:11.430> away

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that's not bad from like 30 yards away

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.170 
that's not bad from like 30 yards away
so<00:01:12.830> here<00:01:13.830> you've<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.979> somewhat

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
so here you've got the the now somewhat

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.270 
so here you've got the the now somewhat
damaged<00:01:18.200> CRT<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.410> we<00:01:19.500> started<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.040> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
damaged CRT that we started with one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
damaged CRT that we started with one
thing<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.700> notice<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.240> glass<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
thing to notice is that the glass is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
thing to notice is that the glass is
incredibly<00:01:25.650> thick<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.940> centimeter

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
incredibly thick it's like a centimeter

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.540 
incredibly thick it's like a centimeter
or<00:01:27.600> half<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.050> inch<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.440> something<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
or half an inch or something it's it's a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.030 
or half an inch or something it's it's a
very<00:01:29.940> big<00:01:30.570> thick<00:01:30.960> piece<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> glass<00:01:31.410> and<00:01:31.920> that's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
very big thick piece of glass and that's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.280 
very big thick piece of glass and that's
why<00:01:32.360> it's<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.390> bad<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> pound<00:01:37.080> on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
why it's it's not bad when you pound on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.100 
why it's it's not bad when you pound on
your<00:01:37.680> monitor<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.550> know<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.030> designed<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
your monitor you know it's designed to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590 
your monitor you know it's designed to
be<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.470> strong<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> phosphor

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
be very strong this is the phosphor

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060 
be very strong this is the phosphor
that's<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.050> coated<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that's actually coated on the back of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.650 
that's actually coated on the back of
the<00:01:44.160> viewing<00:01:44.369> screen<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.030> electron<00:01:45.420> beam

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
the viewing screen the electron beam

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.410 
the viewing screen the electron beam
hits<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.380> phosphor<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.220> causes<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hits that phosphor and causes it to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.529 
hits that phosphor and causes it to
light<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.869> each<00:01:49.649> pixel<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.550> made<00:01:50.580> up<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.030> three
