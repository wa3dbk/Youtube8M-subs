00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.879 
on how to have a successful first flight
yeah<00:00:12.690> we've<00:00:12.840> done<00:00:12.960> lots<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.320> content<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
can cause you a crash yeah flying isn't

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.140 
can cause you a crash yeah flying isn't
magic<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.400> doesn't<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.760> happen

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
magic it doesn't just happen

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.689 
magic it doesn't just happen
it's<00:00:24.390> science<00:00:24.930> science<00:00:25.590> yeah<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.250> number<00:00:26.519> one

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's science science yeah so number one

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
it's science science yeah so number one
we're<00:00:27.090> gonna<00:00:27.210> talk<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.420> control<00:00:27.840> surfaces

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
we're gonna talk about control surfaces

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
we're gonna talk about control surfaces
what<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.980> control<00:00:29.369> surfaces<00:00:29.789> that's<00:00:30.060> like

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
what are control surfaces that's like

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.820 
what are control surfaces that's like
your<00:00:30.449> rudder<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.320> ailerons<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
your rudder or your ailerons you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
your rudder or your ailerons you
elevator<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.489> things<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> plane<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.600> do

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
elevator the things on the plane that do

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.889 
elevator the things on the plane that do
this<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> decide<00:00:36.059> where<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> plane

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
this and this and decide where the plane

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
this and this and decide where the plane
goes<00:00:37.140> yeah<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.440> guide<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.829> plane<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> if

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
goes yeah they guide your plane and if

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.709 
goes yeah they guide your plane and if
you<00:00:38.370> plug<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.550> aileron<00:00:39.000> into<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.360> elevator

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you plug your aileron into your elevator

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
you plug your aileron into your elevator
you're<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> trouble<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:40.980> control

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you're in trouble right also control

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.790 
you're in trouble right also control
throws<00:00:41.879> -<00:00:42.210> yeah<00:00:42.690> water<00:00:43.079> throw<00:00:43.320> does<00:00:43.469> not<00:00:43.620> mean

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
throws - yeah water throw does not mean

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410 
throws - yeah water throw does not mean
more<00:00:43.980> control<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.180> throw

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
more control so if you have more throw

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.459 
more control so if you have more throw
if<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> throw<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.289> means

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
if you have a lot of throw that means

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
if you have a lot of throw that means
that<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.219> movement<00:00:47.489> happening

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that there's a lot of movement happening

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
that there's a lot of movement happening
in<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.210> control<00:00:48.480> surfaces<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.260> not

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
in your control surfaces that's not

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
in your control surfaces that's not
necessarily<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.039> good<00:00:50.250> thing<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.760> that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
necessarily a good thing because that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
necessarily a good thing because that
means<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.360> tiny<00:00:51.629> stick<00:00:51.899> movement<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
means a tiny stick movement can make the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
means a tiny stick movement can make the
plane<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.520> big<00:00:53.550> movement<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.360> always

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
plane do a really big movement so always

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
plane do a really big movement so always
look<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:54.989> manufacturer<00:00:55.590> specs<00:00:55.860> whether

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
look at your manufacturer specs whether

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
look at your manufacturer specs whether
you're<00:00:56.250> scratch<00:00:56.489> building<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.180> whether

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you're scratch building or whether

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.729 
you're scratch building or whether
you're<00:00:57.690> buying<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.079> plane<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> hobby<00:00:58.649> shop

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you're buying a plane from a hobby shop

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.840 
you're buying a plane from a hobby shop
they're<00:00:59.309> always<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.640> have

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
they're always gonna have

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
they're always gonna have
recommendations<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.629> proper<00:01:01.079> throw<00:01:01.350> okay<00:01:01.829> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
recommendations on proper throw okay so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
recommendations on proper throw okay so
for<00:01:02.190> number<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> mentioned<00:01:03.359> that

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
for number two now you mentioned that

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.700 
for number two now you mentioned that
you<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.080> everything<00:01:04.379> plugged<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you have to have everything plugged in

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.050 
you have to have everything plugged in
the<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:04.949> place<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> aileron<00:01:05.670> plugged<00:01:05.939> in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the right place the aileron plugged in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
the right place the aileron plugged in
for<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> aileron<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
for the aileron but just because you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
for the aileron but just because you
have<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.860> plugged<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> doesn't<00:01:08.790> necessarily

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
have it plugged in doesn't necessarily

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.190 
have it plugged in doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> right

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
mean that it's going in the right

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
mean that it's going in the right
direction<00:01:10.380> meaning<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> pull

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
direction meaning that when you pull

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
direction meaning that when you pull
back<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> stick<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> necessarily

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
back on the stick it's not necessarily

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
back on the stick it's not necessarily
going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> give<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
going to give you up or down you have to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
going to give you up or down you have to
make<00:01:15.330> sure<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
make sure that it's going to do the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
make sure that it's going to do the
right<00:01:17.130> movement<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> simple

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
right movement and there's a simple

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.109 
right movement and there's a simple
technique<00:01:18.600> called<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> high-five<00:01:19.350> method<00:01:20.119> we

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
technique called the high-five method we

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
technique called the high-five method we
high-five<00:01:21.630> whenever<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> say<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.680> how<00:01:23.130> does

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
high-five whenever we say that how does

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
high-five whenever we say that how does
that<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:23.460> well<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> high-five<00:01:24.450> method<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that work well the high-five method you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
that work well the high-five method you
can<00:01:25.049> actually<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.650> transmitter<00:01:26.100> hold

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
can actually take your transmitter hold

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
can actually take your transmitter hold
it<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:26.880> top<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> center<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.049> plane

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it over top of the center of your plane

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.370 
it over top of the center of your plane
the<00:01:28.890> each<00:01:29.159> control<00:01:29.640> input<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.509> corresponding

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the each control input the corresponding

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
the each control input the corresponding
control<00:01:31.650> surface<00:01:32.159> should<00:01:32.340> come<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> meet

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
control surface should come up to meet

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
control surface should come up to meet
it<00:01:33.119> hence<00:01:33.450> high-fiving<00:01:34.290> yeah<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it hence high-fiving yeah we have a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
it hence high-fiving yeah we have a
video<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> explains<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.820> lot<00:01:35.850> better<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
video that explains a lot better one of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.640 
video that explains a lot better one of
the<00:01:36.659> biggest<00:01:36.990> things<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> people<00:01:37.500> struggle

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the biggest things that people struggle

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
the biggest things that people struggle
with<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> can't<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
with is one thing you can't see you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.170 
with is one thing you can't see you
can't<00:01:39.570> program<00:01:40.079> center<00:01:40.799> gravity<00:01:41.040> yeah<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.759> CG

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
can't program center gravity yeah or CG

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
can't program center gravity yeah or CG
or<00:01:42.390> CG<00:01:42.869> often<00:01:43.170> times<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.500> give<00:01:43.649> acronyms<00:01:44.100> like

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
or CG often times we give acronyms like

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
or CG often times we give acronyms like
ESC<00:01:44.790> s<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> electronic<00:01:45.540> speed<00:01:45.810> control

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
ESC s which is electronic speed control

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.649 
ESC s which is electronic speed control
or<00:01:46.229> CG<00:01:46.619> center<00:01:47.280> gravity<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:48.240> something<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
or CG center gravity is something to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
or CG center gravity is something to
have<00:01:48.810> speed<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.079> every<00:01:49.380> airplane<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.860> has<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
have speed on every airplane it has to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
have speed on every airplane it has to
be<00:01:50.430> written<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.420> somewhere<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
be written down somewhere the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.810 
be written down somewhere the
manufacturer<00:01:52.799> has<00:01:52.890> specified<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> got

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
manufacturer has specified and you got

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
manufacturer has specified and you got
to<00:01:53.970> listen<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.509> yeah<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.020> center<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to listen to it yeah if your center of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.510 
to listen to it yeah if your center of
gravity<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.890> means<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.399> your

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
gravity is off that means that your

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
gravity is off that means that your
plane<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.299> flying<00:01:57.750> nose-heavy

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
plane is going to be flying nose-heavy

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
plane is going to be flying nose-heavy
or<00:01:58.530> tail-heavy<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.820> ways<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
or tail-heavy just in ways that that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
or tail-heavy just in ways that that
isn't<00:02:00.810> good<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.590> pay<00:02:01.829> attention<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
isn't good so always pay attention to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.230 
isn't good so always pay attention to
your<00:02:02.250> center<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.579> gravity<00:02:02.640> make<00:02:03.060> sure<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
your center of gravity make sure it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
your center of gravity make sure it
balances<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.689> got<00:02:03.810> lots<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> videos<00:02:04.259> about

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
balances we got lots of videos about

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319 
balances we got lots of videos about
that<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.369> important<00:02:06.030> one

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that because it's very important one

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.380 
that because it's very important one
important<00:02:06.719> thing<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> remember

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
important thing you remember

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.120 
important thing you remember
nose<00:02:07.600> have<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.900> playing<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.259> 5-4<00:02:08.710> li<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.100> a

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
nose have you playing a 5-4 li but a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.740 
nose have you playing a 5-4 li but a
tail-heavy<00:02:09.369> plan<00:02:09.820> will<00:02:09.970> only<00:02:10.090> fly<00:02:10.330> one<00:02:10.570> so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
tail-heavy plan will only fly one so

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.880 
tail-heavy plan will only fly one so
it's<00:02:10.869> better<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.200> favorite<00:02:11.590> little<00:02:11.770> bit

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
it's better to favorite little bit

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's better to favorite little bit
towards<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.160> nose<00:02:12.370> heavy<00:02:12.610> side<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> tail

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
towards a nose heavy side then the tail

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.660 
towards a nose heavy side then the tail
have<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.080> sign<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.440> again<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.190> notice<00:02:15.550> have

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
have you sign it again and notice have

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.580 
have you sign it again and notice have
you<00:02:15.760> plane<00:02:15.940> will<00:02:16.060> fly<00:02:16.090> poorly<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> tail

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you plane will fly poorly but a tail

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.080 
you plane will fly poorly but a tail
having<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> plane<00:02:18.010> will<00:02:18.130> fly<00:02:18.160> only<00:02:18.550> once<00:02:18.790> you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
having a plane will fly only once you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.820 
having a plane will fly only once you
such<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> large<00:02:19.630> man<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.380> always<00:02:20.530> make<00:02:20.650> sure

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
such a large man so always make sure

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.500 
such a large man so always make sure
your<00:02:21.070> center<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.310> gravity<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.760> proper<00:02:22.150> don't

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
your center of gravity is proper don't

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
your center of gravity is proper don't
neglect<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.020> step<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.680> easiest

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
neglect the step it's one of the easiest

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.890 
neglect the step it's one of the easiest
things<00:02:24.040> neglect<00:02:24.550> it's<00:02:24.970> very<00:02:25.210> simple<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.630> check

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
things neglect it's very simple to check

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.570 
things neglect it's very simple to check
always<00:02:26.320> make<00:02:26.530> sure<00:02:26.560> your<00:02:26.860> plane<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.250> properly

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
always make sure your plane is properly

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.370 
always make sure your plane is properly
balanced<00:02:28.030> go<00:02:28.330> gets<00:02:28.600> balanced<00:02:28.990> it'll<00:02:29.200> fly

another<00:02:29.830> thing<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.160> check<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.580> your<00:02:30.700> battery

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
another thing to check is your battery

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
apply your brand new plane but you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.040 
apply your brand new plane but you
didn't<00:02:37.150> make<00:02:37.240> sure<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.630> battery<00:02:37.959> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.510 
didn't make sure that that battery is
charged<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.590> take<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.190> air<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
charged you take it up in the air and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.880 
charged you take it up in the air and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
that battery checkers and also voltage

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.340 
that battery checkers and also voltage
alarms<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.030> while<00:02:46.209> you're<00:02:46.390> flying<00:02:46.630> it'll

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
alarms so while you're flying it'll

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.449 
alarms so while you're flying it'll
actually<00:02:47.440> give<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.739> alters<00:02:48.040> arm<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.340> don't

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
actually give you alters arm you don't

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.250 
actually give you alters arm you don't
ever<00:02:48.670> want<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> over<00:02:49.270> discharge<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.989> lipo

couple bucks worth every penny

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.650 
couple bucks worth every penny
now<00:03:12.040> what<00:03:12.190> about<00:03:12.250> range<00:03:12.670> checking<00:03:13.269> range

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
now what about range checking range

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.449 
now what about range checking range
second<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.140> important<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.799> can't<00:03:15.070> fly<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.310> if

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
second is important you can't fly it if

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.009 
second is important you can't fly it if
you<00:03:15.519> can't<00:03:15.700> control<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.360> especially<00:03:16.690> on<00:03:16.959> a

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
you can't control it and especially on a

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.330 
you can't control it and especially on a
new<00:03:17.170> model<00:03:17.530> if<00:03:17.890> you're<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:18.160> out<00:03:18.310> to

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
new model if you're going out to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.259 
new model if you're going out to
maintenance<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.850> want<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> make<00:03:19.180> sure

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
maintenance you want to make sure

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.670 
maintenance you want to make sure
everything's<00:03:19.540> plugged<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.110> also<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.410> range

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
everything's plugged in but also a range

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.320 
everything's plugged in but also a range
tech<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.100> very<00:03:21.280> important<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> range<00:03:22.090> check

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
tech is very important so a range check

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.240 
tech is very important so a range check
that<00:03:22.480> determines<00:03:22.959> how<00:03:23.080> far<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.040> fly<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
that determines how far you can fly the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.949 
that determines how far you can fly the
plane<00:03:24.340> yep<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.120> don't<00:03:25.299> have<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.540> walk<00:03:25.750> say

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
plane yep and you don't have to walk say

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.180 
plane yep and you don't have to walk say
you<00:03:26.049> have<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.200> mile<00:03:26.410> range<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.860> don't<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.100> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
you have a mile range you don't have to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
you have a mile range you don't have to
walk<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> mile<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.910> lot<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.269> transmitters<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:28.810> a

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
walk a mile a lot of transmitters have a

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.990 
walk a mile a lot of transmitters have a
range<00:03:29.350> check<00:03:29.680> button<00:03:29.950> got<00:03:30.370> our<00:03:30.519> way<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.700> range

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
range check button got our way to range

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.160 
range check button got our way to range
check<00:03:31.299> where<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.540> usually<00:03:31.630> hold<00:03:31.930> down<00:03:32.140> your

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
check where you usually hold down your

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.350 
check where you usually hold down your
trainer<00:03:32.739> switch<00:03:33.010> walk<00:03:33.549> out<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:33.850> many<00:03:33.910> paces<00:03:34.180> I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
trainer switch walk out so many paces I

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.640 
trainer switch walk out so many paces I
think<00:03:34.540> we've<00:03:34.660> done<00:03:34.750> some<00:03:34.959> video<00:03:35.170> content<00:03:35.590> on

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
think we've done some video content on

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.289 
think we've done some video content on
that<00:03:35.769> in<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.890> past<00:03:35.950> yeah<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:37.239> very

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
that in the past yeah and it's very

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.490 
that in the past yeah and it's very
important<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.080> because<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.470> don't

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
important to do that because you don't

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.840 
important to do that because you don't
want<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.799> take<00:03:38.890> off<00:03:39.040> your<00:03:39.070> plane<00:03:39.370> setting<00:03:39.700> lose

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
want to take off your plane setting lose

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.699 
want to take off your plane setting lose
control<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.110> searching<00:03:41.470> for<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
control and then go on searching for it

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.150 
control and then go on searching for it
right

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
right

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.770 
right
and<00:03:42.250> then<00:03:42.459> our<00:03:42.640> sixth<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.180> final<00:03:43.209> point<00:03:43.660> is

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and then our sixth and final point is

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.050 
and then our sixth and final point is
always<00:03:44.170> take<00:03:44.410> off<00:03:44.590> into<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.130> wind<00:03:45.250> yeah

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
always take off into the wind yeah

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.759 
always take off into the wind yeah
taking<00:03:46.540> off<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.930> winds<00:03:47.080> important<00:03:47.470> across

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
taking off in the winds important across

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.259 
taking off in the winds important across
when<00:03:48.010> take<00:03:48.340> off<00:03:48.519> especially<00:03:48.760> when<00:03:49.060> you're

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
when take off especially when you're

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.400 
when take off especially when you're
learning<00:03:49.360> how<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.630> fly<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:49.959> incredibly

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
learning how to fly is incredibly

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.050 
learning how to fly is incredibly
difficult<00:03:50.620> yeah<00:03:51.160> your<00:03:51.400> plan<00:03:51.610> would<00:03:51.790> be<00:03:51.880> like

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
difficult yeah your plan would be like

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.330 
difficult yeah your plan would be like
this<00:03:52.930> it'll<00:03:53.200> start<00:03:53.470> leaning<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.100> that's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
this it'll start leaning and that's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.340 
this it'll start leaning and that's
awkward<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.570> was<00:03:55.750> awkward<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:56.200> now

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
awkward it is that was awkward just now

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.620 
awkward it is that was awkward just now
a<00:03:56.620> downwind<00:03:57.160> takeoff<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.790> unacceptable<00:03:58.480> or

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
a downwind takeoff is unacceptable or

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.060 
a downwind takeoff is unacceptable or
down<00:03:58.840> when<00:03:59.019> landing<00:03:59.290> make<00:03:59.440> sure<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.769> airplane

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
down when landing make sure the airplane

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.590 
down when landing make sure the airplane
is<00:04:00.190> always<00:04:00.430> pointed<00:04:00.730> into<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.910> wind<00:04:00.970> when

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
is always pointed into the wind when

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.880 
is always pointed into the wind when
you're<00:04:01.720> taking<00:04:02.019> off<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.290> landing<00:04:02.320> as<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.769> get

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
you're taking off and landing as you get

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.740 
you're taking off and landing as you get
more<00:04:03.070> advanced<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.579> try<00:04:03.760> cross<00:04:04.030> one<00:04:04.269> but

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
more advanced you can try cross one but

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.020 
more advanced you can try cross one but
no<00:04:04.900> one<00:04:05.019> ever<00:04:05.140> lands<00:04:05.470> down<00:04:05.650> one<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.910> any

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
no one ever lands down one for any

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.610 
no one ever lands down one for any
reason<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.720> very<00:04:07.959> dangerous<00:04:08.320> thing<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.470> do

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
reason it's a very dangerous thing to do

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.170 
reason it's a very dangerous thing to do
because<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.920> plane<00:04:09.250> acts<00:04:09.579> funny

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
because the plane acts funny

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.400 
because the plane acts funny
