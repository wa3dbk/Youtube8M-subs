tangle again because it served me well
and<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.910> still<00:01:00.180> wish<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.449> knew<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.629> places<00:01:00.899> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and I still wish I knew what places but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.349 
and I still wish I knew what places but
anyway<00:01:01.440> yeah<00:01:01.620> platinum<00:01:02.100> fits<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.059> gold<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
anyway yeah platinum fits with gold and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.609 
anyway yeah platinum fits with gold and
silver<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.809> better<00:01:04.019> especially<00:01:04.199> because

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
silver a lot better especially because

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
silver a lot better especially because
they're<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.860> sodding<00:01:05.369> metals<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> crystal

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they're all sodding metals and crystal

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 
they're all sodding metals and crystal
isn't<00:01:06.240> even<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> real<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.350> because

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
isn't even a real thing and because

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.320 
isn't even a real thing and because
pearls<00:01:08.189> aren't<00:01:08.369> exactly<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> real<00:01:09.060> thing

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pearls aren't exactly a real thing

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080 
pearls aren't exactly a real thing
either<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.900> diamonds<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.470> iffy<00:01:11.250> their<00:01:11.670> form

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.270 
either and diamonds are iffy their form
of<00:01:12.270> carbon<00:01:12.659> i<00:01:13.490> would<00:01:14.490> say<00:01:14.750> diamond<00:01:15.750> pearl

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
of carbon i would say diamond pearl

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.149 
of carbon i would say diamond pearl
crystal<00:01:17.280> would<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:17.939> acceptable<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
crystal would be more acceptable and

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.950 
crystal would be more acceptable and
only<00:01:19.280> saying<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.520> cuz<00:01:19.789> platinum<00:01:20.509> fits<00:01:20.749> so

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.809 
I still think it sort of might have been
a<00:01:58.789> good<00:01:59.209> like<00:01:59.959> counterpart<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.709> pollito<00:02:01.219> kinda

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
a good like counterpart to pollito kinda

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.369 
a good like counterpart to pollito kinda
in<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.360> would<00:02:02.450> be<00:02:02.569> as<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.689> good<00:02:02.899> evolution

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:03.379 
in that it would be as a good evolution

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.109 
in that it would be as a good evolution

cries<00:03:07.190> yeah<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.400> bug<00:03:08.610> types<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> fourth

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
cries yeah the bug types of the fourth

cries yeah the bug types of the fourth
generation<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.080> really<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.440> much<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.980> me<00:03:11.130> I

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
generation don't really do much for me I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.100 
generation don't really do much for me I
heracross<00:03:14.250> seems<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> could<00:03:15.630> do<00:03:15.870> a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
heracross seems like it could do a

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.830 
heracross seems like it could do a
pincer<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:16.860> needs<00:03:17.040> evolution<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.570> eric

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
pincer really needs evolution and eric

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.140 
pincer really needs evolution and eric
ross<00:03:19.050> could<00:03:19.459> work<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.850> even<00:03:21.090> though

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
ross could work with one even though

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.510 
ross could work with one even though
it's<00:03:21.300> already<00:03:21.570> sort<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> overpowered<00:03:22.590> it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
it's already sort of overpowered it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.670 
it's already sort of overpowered it
seems<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.390> doesn't<00:03:24.870> look<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.380> fully

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
seems like it doesn't look like a fully

seems like it doesn't look like a fully

evolved Pokemon to me I don't know I'm

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.990 
evolved Pokemon to me I don't know I'm
just<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:28.080> fifth<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:29.340> fourth<00:03:29.580> generation

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
just the fifth the fourth generation

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
it be able to evolve to me but

it can't be on its own is actually a
very<00:06:35.360> legitimate<00:06:35.600> Pokemon<00:06:36.410> to<00:06:36.590> use

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
okay so that's already a lot more

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.140 
okay so that's already a lot more
exciting<00:06:44.009> than<00:06:44.099> ranked<00:06:44.370> a<00:06:44.610> was<00:06:45.259> ranked<00:06:47.150> see

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
exciting than ranked a was ranked see

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.529 
exciting than ranked a was ranked see
was<00:06:49.039> this<00:06:50.039> crap<00:06:50.430> no<00:06:50.610> it<00:06:50.729> wasn't<00:06:50.999> actually<00:06:51.270> this

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
was this crap no it wasn't actually this

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.300 
was this crap no it wasn't actually this
could<00:06:51.599> be<00:06:51.960> potentially<00:06:52.110> good<00:06:52.680> if<00:06:52.770> it<00:06:52.860> had<00:06:53.009> less

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
could be potentially good if it had less

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.070 
could be potentially good if it had less
terrible<00:06:53.699> moves<00:06:54.029> that<00:06:54.300> took<00:06:54.449> forever<00:06:54.779> to

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
terrible moves that took forever to

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.629 
terrible moves that took forever to
charge<00:06:55.439> up<00:06:55.650> so<00:06:55.830> I'm<00:06:55.919> gonna<00:06:56.069> assume<00:06:56.340> this<00:06:56.580> is

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
charge up so I'm gonna assume this is

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.249 
charge up so I'm gonna assume this is
actually<00:06:57.090> gonna<00:06:57.360> teach<00:06:57.599> some<00:06:57.779> pieces<00:06:57.990> moves

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
actually gonna teach some pieces moves

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.459

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
actually pretty good isn't it I wonder

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.170 
actually pretty good isn't it I wonder
how<00:07:04.139> do<00:07:05.009> they<00:07:05.129> really<00:07:05.340> plug<00:07:05.759> in<00:07:05.909> all<00:07:06.029> the

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
how do they really plug in all the

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.450 
how do they really plug in all the
weight<00:07:06.449> data<00:07:06.719> for<00:07:07.020> this<00:07:07.830> game<00:07:08.159> it's<00:07:08.689> very<00:07:09.689> nice

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
weight data for this game it's very nice

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.399 
weight data for this game it's very nice
so<00:07:11.460> faint<00:07:11.849> it<00:07:12.000> slightly<00:07:12.449> down<00:07:12.689> pin<00:07:12.990> down<00:07:13.169> and<00:07:13.349> I

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
so faint it slightly down pin down and I

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:14.269 
so faint it slightly down pin down and I
would<00:07:13.529> like<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:13.710> learn<00:07:13.889> something<00:07:14.159> else
