00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.130 

okay<00:00:01.410> today<00:00:01.800> we're<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.280> look<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.730> an<00:00:03.480> oil

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay today we're going to look at an oil

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay today we're going to look at an oil
burger<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.950> how<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.370> works<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.170> see<00:00:07.170> if<00:00:07.259> we

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
burger and how it works and see if we

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.410 
burger and how it works and see if we
can<00:00:07.529> get<00:00:07.680> some<00:00:07.919> idea<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.849> combustion<00:00:09.210> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
can get some idea of the combustion of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.190 
can get some idea of the combustion of
this<00:00:09.540> oil<00:00:10.219> now<00:00:11.219> oil<00:00:11.550> has<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.300> turned<00:00:12.840> into<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
this oil now oil has to be turned into a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.550 
this oil now oil has to be turned into a
gas<00:00:13.700> before<00:00:14.700> it'll<00:00:14.880> burn<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.260> there's<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
gas before it'll burn so there's a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.529 
gas before it'll burn so there's a
nozzle<00:00:16.859> inside<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.699> burner<00:00:17.970> head<00:00:18.270> down

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
nozzle inside that burner head down

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
nozzle inside that burner head down
there<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.619> takes<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.130> high<00:00:20.340> pressure<00:00:20.670> oil

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
there that takes the high pressure oil

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.070 
there that takes the high pressure oil
and<00:00:21.390> sprays<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> very<00:00:22.830> fine<00:00:23.160> mist<00:00:24.080> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and sprays it into a very fine mist the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.750 
and sprays it into a very fine mist the
missed<00:00:25.760> goal<00:00:26.760> atomized<00:00:27.269> oil<00:00:28.160> if<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.460> small

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
missed goal atomized oil if it's small

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.450 
missed goal atomized oil if it's small
enough<00:00:30.050> it<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.320> love<00:00:31.740> light<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:34.460> evaporate

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
enough it will love light and evaporate

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
enough it will love light and evaporate
the<00:00:35.610> rest<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.969> dropped<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.450> surround<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the rest is dropped and surround it to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.770 
the rest is dropped and surround it to
complete<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> burn

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
complete the burn

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.510 
complete the burn
now<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.050> one's<00:00:40.260> been<00:00:40.469> disconnected<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.340> its

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
now this one's been disconnected on its

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
now this one's been disconnected on its
spark<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.510> spark<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.110> like

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
spark so there's no spark when I like

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.150 
spark so there's no spark when I like
this<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:44.579> you'll<00:00:44.850> see<00:00:45.530> we've<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> fog

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this up now you'll see we've got a fog

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.380 
this up now you'll see we've got a fog
that<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:50.100> adding<00:00:50.489> life<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
that is adding life or it

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.000 
that is adding life or it
if<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.930> light<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:55.080> get<00:00:56.080> far

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.970 

now<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:01.550> fire<00:01:01.820> if<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.450> look<00:01:02.690> close<00:01:03.079> probably

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
now this fire if you look close probably

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.649 
now this fire if you look close probably
see<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.250> little<00:01:04.430> bit<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.760> black<00:01:04.940> smoke<00:01:05.180> coming

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
see a little bit of black smoke coming

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.680 
see a little bit of black smoke coming
out<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.050> that's<00:01:07.210> normal<00:01:08.210> for<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.510> way

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
out of it that's normal for the way

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.930 
out of it that's normal for the way
we're<00:01:08.900> doing<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:09.400> there's<00:01:10.400> fire<00:01:10.640> break

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
we're doing this there's fire break

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.670 
we're doing this there's fire break
underneath<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.690> but<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.050> does<00:01:12.260> not<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:12.650> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
underneath it but this does not have a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.580 
underneath it but this does not have a
combustion<00:01:13.490> team

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
combustion team

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.530 
combustion team
and<00:01:15.829> question<00:01:16.399> chamber<00:01:16.790> will<00:01:16.939> help<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.329> lot

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
and question chamber will help a lot

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.359 
and question chamber will help a lot
here<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.590> need

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
here because we need

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
here because we need
therefore<00:01:20.119> equal

now pretty much 63 users all the way
around<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.030> they're<00:01:38.030> reflecting<00:01:38.750> heat

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
around it and they're reflecting heat
