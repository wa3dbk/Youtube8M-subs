00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 how to build a mini home robot let me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.280
 tell them that this thing I did not want 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.830
 but since some friends of taringa 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.409
 they asked me to do it here 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.390
 it's good what we need is super 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.950
 home everybody has his house 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.870
 dental brush head 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:33.340
 unfinished electrical tape 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.640
 a little motor wants to get me control or 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.270
 cell phone vibrator 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 a 3 volt clock battery very well 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.900
 let's start all we need is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.060
 our toothbrush head 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.360
 and our motor ok let's take a little 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.310
 of tape isolate very little 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.670
 let me because I have we can of 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.670
 meeting 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.170
 let's cut it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.740
 this we are going to put tantita to our 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.920
 our little engine 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.570
 and we will stick to the central 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.750
 whole brush 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.750
 okay 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 OK 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 now the next is the stack 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.340
 let's put the positive pole stuck on 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.340
 positive and negative cable 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.430
 is that I do not place it well 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.190
 we stick it with tape so we do not miss 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.190
 make 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.100
 and we put the pole here 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.730
 ok let's leave a part open 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.240
 because we can go 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.950
 and enter it 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 but I'm doing stupid things 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.159
 since he had not armed one before 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.540
 now I have problems 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.769
 since from the village down 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.709
 your clark business and we paste it 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.709
 totally the pirate because he does not know 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 I'm very sorry for the solution too 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.470
 in my camera 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.069
 since as I mentioned in the video of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.069
 download the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.480
 with my computer so I'm going to occupy 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.409
 bringing the positive people where 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.409
 have to go 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.570
 I'm older everything I did not 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.100
 works good until next time we are not 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.010
