00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.839
 Hello, Michael Vsause here. Do you want to be infected with Ebola? 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.370
 Without having to leave your home, or interact with others? 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.670
 Well, you may be lucky you can already download the "Ebola" 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.380
 Genium. 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.770
 Here is already online, as the case is, if you are willing to wait 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.949
 A few years of 3D organic printing technology to progress 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.720
 A little bit, you can get one then, bring the genome to it 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.250
 Ta Da! Everyone can print "Ebola" 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.940
 Or anthrax or whatever you wish to produce in bulk at home 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.380
 To eliminate humanity, 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.520
 Are humans on their way to extinction 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 coming soon? You will be human extinction 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.989
 "Human beings"? This is the result of actions 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 Human beings, or they will be one of the good old fashioned types 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 From the date of extinction Earth knows well? 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.359
 Global Disaster Risk Survey, Oxford University 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.470
 The future of the humanitarian institution is in danger of extinction 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 Before 2100 by 19% 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.970
 Now, you may be thinking that "whatever, just heresy" 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.400
 Everything will be fine, humans are very smart 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.860
 It's hard to be extinct maybe you're right. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.570
 But it is difficult to predict the distant future 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.010
 With a lot of certainty. What is really wonderful though 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.990
 Of that in the case of acceptance that uncertainty, a simple argument 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.330
 It can show that human extinction soon is actually 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.360
 More likely, it is called "Doomsday" 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.380
 Imagine a giant jar 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.540
 Which contain either 10 balls 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.259
 Numbered from 1 to 10, or a million balls 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.399
 Numbered from 1 to 1,000,000 now, you do not know 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.000
 What is the case, but you are allowed to withdraw 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.289
 One ball, you go ahead and do it 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.770
 And it is ball number 4 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.000
 This is a very strong guide in case there are 10 balls 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 Because the number 4 pull out of the set where 10 balls 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 The probability is 1 in 10, but 4 withdraws from a total of one million of different numbers 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 The probability of which is 1 of 1,000,000 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.100
 Through homogeneity, "you" also numbered ball 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.470
 You are a man who knows 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.790
 Almost what is your birth number 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.049
 It's probably somewhere around 100 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.120
 One billion. So many other human beings 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.540
 They were probably born before you. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.040
 Most importantly, you did not get to decide on the date of birth 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.170
 Which you like, if, it's just like a ball number. 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.420
 You are a random sample of a group of humans 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.549
 Who will ever live, "Doomsday" refers to that 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.519
 Of the 200 billion people there is a 50% chance of randomly choosing a person 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 As your choice you will be born in the first hundred billion. 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.870
 While if there are 10 trillion people 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 There is only 1% chance distributed per person 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.209
 To convey you, can happen to be born in the first billion. 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.440
 Either be one hundred percent 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.050
 And lucky to have been born early in the story of mankind is unlikely. 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.390
 Or your generator number will be expected. 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.840
 Because there will not be 100 trillion people. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.390
 Human extinction will happen soon. 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.730
 Sooner or later. But before it becomes 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.440
 I am very convinced that the end is near. Keep in mind that the Day of Resurrection 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.240
 Not 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.730
 Are indisputable. One problem is likely 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.560
 To be a "reference class problem". Are you really 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.920
 A random sample of a group of humans who have been born in any 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.020
 time ago? Well, if you think the future is not too long 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.420
 Humans will be quite different from what they are today. 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.460
 For example, there will be plenty of 3D devices to print members. 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.800
 Just the fact that right now there are not too many people 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.660
 On the trail can be a proof that you were not a random sample 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.920
 Of a group of humans. 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.150
 Only from a group of humans like you 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.960
 Like what's happening around you. These were born 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.650
 Early in human history also 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.910
 "Doomsday" does not reconsider the possibilities 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.060
 Actual threats or human merits 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.630
 On those threats in the future. Just suppose 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.180
 We do not know which side the balance will tilt 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.610
 Human extinction is near and human extinction later 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.530
 Probably equally. But maybe you do not believe it. 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.540
 Perhaps you are convinced that the genius of man 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.960
 Will keep him one step ahead of any event of human extinction 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.150
 Lying on it, you may be right 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.700
 But there is reason to doubt that optimism. 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.900
 For example, "Fermi paradox" 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.900
 If it is possible that the forms of intelligent life in our universe are capable 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.530
 To live for billions 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.199
 And billions of years where are they? 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.250
 Why is the sky completely silent? Probably 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.250
 This is because the stages of the extinction event are not primed 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.860
 Only very common for intelligent life anywhere 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.680
 For ever occurring. 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.400
 if, 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.930
 Does this mean that we must surrender? 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.030
 The voluntary human extinction movement believes it 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
 Founded in 1991, its supporters believe 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.440
 That humans have a negative impact 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.360
 On the ground will always remain. 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.260
 Thus we have a moral duty to stop reproduction 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.770
 Instantly fade away forever. But what will he appreciate 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.110
 What to do? In case, that 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.050
 What kind of thing he did was "Tom 7". Create a program that plays video games 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.210
 The program came with new techniques and strategies for playing games 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.510
 And even exploit gaps 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.699
 People do not know it, or at least 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.240
 I have no news of them, I also have a program to play other games. 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.720
 Such as "tetris" that I think are connected 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.560
 Directly to our question. The computer struggles to figure out what to do 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.919
 As you can see, the computer is not programmed to consider the repercussions of the distant future 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:37.880
 enough 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.820
 Note that the "Tetriminos" line up in certain ways 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.770
 Makes a big difference. In one run, when confronted with 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.750
 Imminent demise, the computer did something 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.820
 Strange, unlike 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.970
 Loss, or "game ended" 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.340
 Just by temporarily stopping the game. 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.280
 "Tom 7" describes computer logic 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.450
 That "the only way to profit 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.870
 Not to play. "That's true 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.990
 If you pause the game forever 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.240
 You will not lose the game, but you will not win 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.470
 Also the game or achieve high score. 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.430
 Now, we can know what it means to achieve 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.490
 Highly sensitive in this universe 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.750
 I mean or whether we are able to achieve one. 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.090
 We may also feel panic sometimes 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.840
 When the future looks bleak. But if we continue playing 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.510
 We continued to learn, the possibilities of our eventual empowerment 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.750
 From finding a solution and playing again 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.870
 Very well, 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.500
 So, thanks for following up the game, for being here 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.880
 As usual. 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880
 thanks for watching.
