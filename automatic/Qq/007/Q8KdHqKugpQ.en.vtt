00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello everyone we are making a video about 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.860
 valve adjustment 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.799
 cars vaz classic adjustable 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.130
 rail by rail with the probe but 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.259
 surprise and faced such a problem 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.560
 Now I will show you her very interesting 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:32.190
 problems you are and so put 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:37.060
 little notes here. we have a low tide there 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:42.270
 camshaft cover and so installed 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:46.330
 4 cylinder rail set to 0 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:54.720
 the arrow, that is, the indicator 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:59.610
 rocker now now wait a second 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:13.120
 raise the rocker what we see for testimony 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 here is now a second 70 and 2 weave it 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:23.640
 readings equal to this probe at 015 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.550
 if i do by the way 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.260
 offered by you machine and clearance 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.830
 valve on rail 050 value of this 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:43.500
 device 052 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:45.270
 equals 0 15 on the probe at will until 052 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.900
 here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.800
 that's how you just saw me was 70 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.910
 a dozen and 2 weave 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:03.310
 I move this device aside 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:07.740
 now so here we remove masturbation on 0 15 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:14.830
 and paste there 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 what we see chuk hardly comes from on 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.709
 heavily 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.880
 that is, if I do like how 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.170
 I recommend 052 conductive 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.280
 there will not climb camshaft condition 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.410
 normal ie there are no samples 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 there are no workings on the camshaft 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.860
 the rocker is not there everything is exactly 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.320
 there is such a difference in the device 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.049
 the device used none such here 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:54.370
 I have three and all three show something about 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.980
 than i say i have this situation 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.980
 it turns out if I do 052 therefore 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.549
 the device from therefore therefore the device has 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:10.269
 then I get probe 015 not included 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:14.489
 between the rocker and camshaft that's when 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.489
 I do on the probe then it turns out 072 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.489
 Chub adequate that is verified 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.489
 micrometer 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.200
 at the factory about the manufacture of which is not 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.290
 cooperative something else soviet probe like 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.360
 would this situation be next what I want 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.870
 say for beginners i first time 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.970
 regulate my life valve and that i 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.970
 I want to say the following here we see 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:56.010
 here on the rail 180 degrees zero 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:57.440
 540 180 360 540 is the degrees to rotate 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.410
 crankshaft 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.400
 here and it is not necessary after each valve 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.920
 twist there you put on 180 then 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.370
 rotate 360 ​​degrees no this 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.410
 just from 0 plus go away and so you have to 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.620
 final tip got 360 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.100
 degrees here i am now why i put 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.720
 Rockefeller here I moved the table 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.450
 from the book the corner is clearly written here 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:33.530
 turning the crankshaft here we look 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.530
 0 180 360 540
