different<00:01:14.490> colors<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> stained<00:01:15.390> glass<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
different colors of stained glass it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
different colors of stained glass it
will<00:01:16.200> change<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.650> color<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> beam<00:01:17.430> sounds

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
will change the color of the beam sounds

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.490 
will change the color of the beam sounds
pretty<00:01:18.240> cool<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.320> like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pretty cool right so if you have like

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.289 
pretty cool right so if you have like
four<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.830> five<00:01:19.890> different<00:01:20.310> shades<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.030> stained

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
four or five different shades of stained

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
four or five different shades of stained
glass<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> beacon<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.280> an

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
glass on a beacon you can get an

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
glass on a beacon you can get an
enormous<00:01:23.970> amount<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.390> colors<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.170> basically

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
enormous amount of colors so basically

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
enormous amount of colors so basically
the<00:01:25.799> amount<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> colors<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.060> up

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the amount of colors you can get is up

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
the amount of colors you can get is up
to<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.479> imagination<00:01:27.740> sounds<00:01:28.740> pretty<00:01:28.860> damn

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to your imagination sounds pretty damn

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
to your imagination sounds pretty damn
awesome<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> also<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.390> show<00:01:30.600> me

playing<00:01:31.049> around<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> beacons<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.070> did

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
playing around with the beacons I did

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.679 
playing around with the beacons I did
find<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> add<00:01:33.420> different

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
find out that when you add different

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
find out that when you add different
colors<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.409> stained<00:01:34.770> glass<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.280> top<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
colors of stained glass on top of that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
colors of stained glass on top of that
weekend<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.450> only<00:01:36.689> output<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.470> type<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
weekend it will only output one type of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
weekend it will only output one type of
color<00:01:38.009> however<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> look<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.060> beam

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
color however if you look at the beam

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
color however if you look at the beam
inside<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> glass<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> same

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
inside the glass it will be the same

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
inside the glass it will be the same
color<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> glass<00:01:42.030> sounds<00:01:42.689> amazingly<00:01:43.079> cool

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
color as the glass sounds amazingly cool

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
color as the glass sounds amazingly cool
right<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> way<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> guys<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
right so that way you guys can have a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
right so that way you guys can have a
bunch<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.390> different<00:01:45.479> options<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.350> get

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
bunch of different options to get

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
bunch of different options to get
yourself<00:01:46.950> some<00:01:47.130> rainbow<00:01:47.520> colored<00:01:47.850> beams<00:01:48.149> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
yourself some rainbow colored beams so

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
yourself some rainbow colored beams so
homies<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> sinews<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> works<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
homies the sinews and how it works but I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.800 
homies the sinews and how it works but I
still<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> talk<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> guys<00:01:51.630> about

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
something and that's something is that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
something and that's something is that
everybody<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> mom<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.479> speculating<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
everybody in the mom is speculating and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.410 
everybody in the mom is speculating and
thinking<00:01:55.710> are<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.280> gonna<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.820> 1.8

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
thinking are we actually gonna get 1.8

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
thinking are we actually gonna get 1.8
features<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> moment<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.950> know

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
features because at the moment we know

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
features because at the moment we know
that<00:01:59.310> we're<00:01:59.460> gonna<00:01:59.549> get<00:01:59.729> doors<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.270> 1.8<00:02:00.840> not

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that we're gonna get doors from 1.8 not

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
that we're gonna get doors from 1.8 not
just<00:02:01.500> adores<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> fences<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> whatnot

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just adores the fences and whatnot

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
just adores the fences and whatnot
Israel<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> second

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
Israel and now we have a second

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
Israel and now we have a second
confirmed<00:02:04.590> feature<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:05.670> 1.8

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
confirmed feature that's also from 1.8

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.639 
confirmed feature that's also from 1.8
so<00:02:06.540> does<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> mean<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.500> be

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
so does that mean that we will be

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
so does that mean that we will be
getting<00:02:07.799> all<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> 1.8<00:02:08.789> feature<00:02:09.060> well<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
getting all of 1.8 feature well I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300 
getting all of 1.8 feature well I
personally<00:02:10.170> don't<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.129> pretty

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
personally don't know but I'm pretty

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.570 
personally don't know but I'm pretty
sure<00:02:11.580> we're<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:12.030> most<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
sure we're gonna get most of the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550 
sure we're gonna get most of the
major<00:02:12.730> features<00:02:13.150> from<00:02:13.300> 1.8<00:02:13.870> because<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.350> think

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
major features from 1.8 because I think

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.140 
major features from 1.8 because I think
that<00:02:14.710> 4j<00:02:15.040> Studios<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.520> trying<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:16.000> really

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that 4j Studios is trying really really

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.630 
that 4j Studios is trying really really
super<00:02:16.570> hard<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.200> get<00:02:17.350> us<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.620> par<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.130> pc

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
super hard to get us on par with the pc

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.370 
super hard to get us on par with the pc
but<00:02:18.910> that's<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.210> my<00:02:19.420> speculation<00:02:19.660> let<00:02:20.290> me

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
but that's just my speculation let me

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.870
