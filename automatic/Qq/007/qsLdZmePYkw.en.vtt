00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.709 
learning how to practice for technical
fluency<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.700> we'll<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:47.969> doing<00:00:48.210> both<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> those

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fluency and we'll be doing both of those

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.020 
fluency and we'll be doing both of those
things<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> course<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
things in this course so that when you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.750 
things in this course so that when you
leave<00:00:51.300> you'll<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.079> repertoire<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.610> you'll

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
leave you'll have repertoire but you'll

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
leave you'll have repertoire but you'll
also<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.239> practice<00:00:54.690> techniques<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
also have practice techniques so that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
also have practice techniques so that
you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.219> practice<00:00:56.430> anything<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.480> run<00:00:57.629> into

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you can practice anything you run into

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
you can practice anything you run into
in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> future<00:00:58.280> we'll<00:00:59.280> work<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.760> refining<00:01:00.300> our

open triads to more complex chords will

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.990 
open triads to more complex chords will
work<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.729> navigating<00:01:24.360> through<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.930> tunings

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
work on navigating through those tunings

work on navigating through those tunings
understanding<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> tunings<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.689> why<00:01:27.840> they

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
understanding the tunings and why they

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710 
understanding the tunings and why they
sound<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:30.360> even

techniques<00:01:36.170> pretty<00:01:37.170> much<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> these

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
techniques pretty much all of these

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810 
techniques pretty much all of these
techniques<00:01:38.540> are<00:01:40.130> successfully<00:01:41.130> used<00:01:41.460> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
techniques are successfully used in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.780 
techniques are successfully used in
songs<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.600> electric<00:01:43.079> guitar<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.560> well<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.460> if

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
