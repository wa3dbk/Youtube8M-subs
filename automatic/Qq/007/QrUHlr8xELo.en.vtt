here's my science comparison between
perfect<00:00:05.640> great<00:00:05.790> wing<00:00:06.210> gundam<00:00:06.540> zero<00:00:06.720> custom

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
perfect great wing gundam zero custom

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.890 
perfect great wing gundam zero custom
and<00:00:07.410> perfect<00:00:08.340> grade<00:00:08.550> gundam<00:00:09.150> mastery<00:00:09.719> red

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and perfect grade gundam mastery red

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.549 
and perfect grade gundam mastery red
frame<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.769> all<00:00:11.070> his<00:00:11.429> accessories<00:00:11.730> attached

and<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.340> ash<00:00:14.820> tree<00:00:15.179> stands<00:00:15.480> much

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and as you can see ash tree stands much

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.310 
and as you can see ash tree stands much
taller<00:00:16.440> than<00:00:16.619> wing<00:00:17.460> gundam<00:00:17.789> zero<00:00:18.000> custom<00:00:18.480> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
taller than wing gundam zero custom but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.279 
taller than wing gundam zero custom but
then<00:00:19.529> again<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.689> mobile<00:00:21.689> suits<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> wing

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
then again the mobile suits in wing

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
then again the mobile suits in wing
gundam<00:00:22.680> were<00:00:22.980> always<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> small<00:00:24.000> side<00:00:24.300> for

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
gundam were always on the small side for

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.939 
gundam were always on the small side for
kit<00:00:25.609> well<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.060> tell<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.830> kind<00:00:28.830> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
kit well so you can tell here kind of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.700 
kit well so you can tell here kind of
the<00:00:29.630> difference<00:00:30.630> between<00:00:30.779> painting<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.500> non

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the difference between painting and non

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.310 
the difference between painting and non
painting<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.550> something<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.149> always

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
painting which is something I always

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.569 
painting which is something I always
tell<00:00:34.320> people<00:00:34.620> whenever<00:00:34.829> they're<00:00:35.100> considering

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579

not<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.270> review<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> said<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
not and I know in my review I said that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
not and I know in my review I said that
wing<00:01:05.970> Gundam<00:01:06.240> 0<00:01:06.450> custom<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.290> very

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
wing Gundam 0 custom has some very

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100 
wing Gundam 0 custom has some very
powerful<00:01:07.710> LEDs<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.570> came<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
powerful LEDs but that also came at the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
powerful LEDs but that also came at the
price<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> needing<00:01:11.220> more<00:01:11.250> batteries<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
price of needing more batteries and the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.130 
price of needing more batteries and the
wiring<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> was<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> pain<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> neck

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
wiring for it was a pain in the neck

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
wiring for it was a pain in the neck
since<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.439> LED<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> chest

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
since there's an LED there in the chest

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
since there's an LED there in the chest
and<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> head<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.500> had<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> wire<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and in the head you had to wire the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
and in the head you had to wire the
whole<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.060> goes<00:01:21.270> wrong<00:01:21.540> they

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
whole thing and if one goes wrong they

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
whole thing and if one goes wrong they
both<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.380> wrong<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.250> show<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
both go wrong so I would show you the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240 
both go wrong so I would show you the
power<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.000> those<00:01:24.150> LEDs<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.500> something<00:01:26.130> went

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
power of those LEDs but something went

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
power of those LEDs but something went
wrong<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.780> want

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
wrong back there and I really don't want

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.149 
wrong back there and I really don't want
to<00:01:28.049> fix<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.439> again<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:31.829> slipped

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to fix it again so and if you're slipped

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.280 
to fix it again so and if you're slipped
between<00:01:32.280> buying<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:33.540> two<00:01:33.750> kits<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
between buying these two kits for a

between buying these two kits for a
perfect<00:01:34.590> grade<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.979> highly<00:01:35.850> suggest<00:01:36.030> ash-tree

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
perfect grade I highly suggest ash-tree

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you have to buy a special battery for it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.660 
you have to buy a special battery for it
but<00:01:51.149> that's<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.320> minor<00:01:52.740> complaint
