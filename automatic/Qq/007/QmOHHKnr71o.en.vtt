 Hi guys, everything is good today's video but it is 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.030

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.460
 make this video in this book 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.369
 so you have to record 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:25.130
 was the door open that has 11 children 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.400
 after the open door the book review 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.400
 incredible places 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:44.280
 he is from the univen our work is a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:51.390
 so cute read it reads 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.670
 I told her not to follow her there and so 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.050
 book was one of the few books I've 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.359
 I cried in my life 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.379
 if not only book how to set here for 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.500
 you 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 The book is narrated in two characters 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:24.799
 each chapter is a character narrating 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.799
 a chapter of the book begins with the end of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.970
 kill yourself in a place of his that is a place 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.509
 high maybe here he goes up there for himself 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 kill there and when it gets there 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.850
 one of the girls from the school there in rome 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.479
 connection between the two and it is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.810
 when the two are like that but I think who 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.630
 is 21 x her as heroine to save 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.399
 Because I do not know, it's popular at last who 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 he enters this pile of this story 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.000
 never talked to him about the moral to him 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.909
 but he does it for her even because 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 He thinks it's just her and I found this. 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.569
 very cute very cute and starts 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.819
 a friendship between the two 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.189
 always connected by what the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.969
 two wanted to kill and it starts to be 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.359
 friends 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:23.409
 throughout the book and it's a breeze 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:28.370
 Both of them have her problems. 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.379
 ayman she died and offends she has several 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.540
 problems I can not speak because otherwise it is 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.340
 heavy spoiler but throughout the book 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 you identify the problem of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.419
 You 'll like the character going. 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.169
 twisting around you worry about 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.319
 he 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.329
 with the two in fact and go we are 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.579
 It's beautiful there, I can not explain it to them anymore. 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:51.560
 Julia to you two young men about to 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.519
 choose from near death to one another to 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.949
 will to live 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.159
 when theodora thinkquest viotti i marked 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:03:00.980
 listening under unusual circumstances 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.049
 a friendship between the two 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.969
 each with their own traumas and 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.290
 suffering they come together to make a 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.359
 geography work end up discovering 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.459
 much more than the incredible places in 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:15.230
 state where the will to save lives 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.509
 another to continue living the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 Spelling work together I would not go 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.419
 to say that we were going to 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.310
 attack 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.340
 They are going to do a job and have done a good job. 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.290
 work and places and talk only about 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
 a bit of history and such and collect 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.939
 something the place left a south on 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.000
 exchange they get addicted to doing this 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.799
 so to know amazing places 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.109
 places that score I think the most 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.669
 because I love to travel now I do not like 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.620
 bring a souvenir to leave a 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.290
 piece thousand back I think not only 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.530
 we are more fantastic than there is and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.329
 they do in various places and so ice 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.870
 She seems that book a love to 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.780
 remember that the boy leads to the networks 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.030
 to dreams and I do not know that yes it is not 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.060
 It's not dreams, it 's a thing without a 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.919
 design of the two looks a bit more 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.530
 I can say that everything I already 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.699
 I saw this sense means they are clichÃ© 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.479
 which is everyone's 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.789
 so at the end of the book I do not 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.519
 I knew what would happen if I imagined more 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:17.639
 did not know and I cried we cried 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.310
 I cried myself 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.939
 we have a very beautiful sentence, there is only one side 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.469
 as well as remember self-help yourself 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:27.539
 so it seems that the author is 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.259
 trying to pass an experiment on him 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.080
 you 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.090
 So it's very beautiful, very beautiful. 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.439
 it's worth you have to buy go 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.789
 tell you that you have all the 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.249
 bookstores in Brazil because I do not know 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.199
 I got this book from the publisher. 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.400
 and I think it's coming up now. 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.020
 in Brazil 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.629
 so if you are in the library that is 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.279
 you do not have is asking to buy 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.930
 because it is very good then order 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.810
 internet should have several sites in 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.400
 internet is very worth it is a book that 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.830
 changed my life and I always think 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.250
 that I forget a little bit I'll read 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.650
 We're really in love again. 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.199
 it's ours has no words to describe 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.719
 How much to run this book knows the type 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.240
 I have not even been in love too much 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.430
 she comes back and her son 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.069
 I hope you read and like that 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.259
 like those who read have said that there speaks 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.969
 did not find spoiler found schools 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.089
 champion spoiler that people do not read 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:23.370
 is you went and said to me after account 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.020

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.680
 other social networks I said is great 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.830

 day I go along with her so I 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.560
 What else do I like that I do not really like? 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.479
 but for now I'll talk about the books 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.639

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.259
