00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
think we deserved it at the end of the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
think we deserved it at the end of the
day<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.330> looked<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.960> thought<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.230> performance

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
day I looked I thought the performance

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.110 
day I looked I thought the performance
was<00:03:14.740> good<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.070> think<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.520> fell<00:03:15.730> away<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
was good I think we fell away in the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.560 
was good I think we fell away in the
last<00:03:16.270> sort<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.540> 2025<00:03:17.200> minutes<00:03:17.850> first<00:03:18.850> half<00:03:19.180> we
