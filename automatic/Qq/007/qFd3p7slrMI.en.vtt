00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.109
 in the next few minutes with the collaboration of the ham master 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.160
 felipe pÃ©rez cruz we will show you quickly and easily how to cut and 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.160
 preserve an authentic Iberian ham 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.499
 to enjoy 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.679
 2 aroma and texture obtained the greatest 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.269
 we will distinguish different parts for the cost 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 against past movilla 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.020
 first we will detail the necessary tools for our work 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 we will use three different knives 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.240
 a short one with a broad leaf 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.500
 and throughout the day leaf this fact but there is more an ax will go to keep the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 knife style 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 finally a table capable of giving enough management to work is 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 tilted on the track 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770
 nothing 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.410
 before the Japan earthquake 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.690
 it is necessary clean 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.230
 we will use the wide blade knife first 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.240
 where a deep cut around the boxes 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 cutting the nerve 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.500
 we will extract the bark clean the outer yellowish bacon and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.590
 Cesar Carranza 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.010
 leaving on clean track ready for cutting 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 For a domestic consumption it is important to clean only the parts that are going to 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.820
 consume 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 protecting the rest of the year 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 we will place the ham on the table with the hammer astiz 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 for the extraction of slices we will use the ham knife 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.410
 the first slices of bacon the strings we see 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 in conserving forecasts 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.800
 min in case the consumption is going to be clinton we will start the chalk by the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.560
 grill 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.210
 more curative because it is a part 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.090
 narrower 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.299
 we will cut keeping always the plan to 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.559
 the cutting area 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.599
 facilitating thus we 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.250
 it is important to combine the most serious part with the bacon to achieve in each 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.249
 fight the maximum solution 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.019
 when we get to hip bone 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.839
 we will use the lace 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839
 to separate the ham from the course 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 the talks 10 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.409
 we will continue extracting slices frob 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 a maximum profit 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.019
 of the mace we will try to comment courtesy of the whole surface to extract 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.069
 slices of different muscles easily identifiable by their 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.309
 different flights 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.309
 and mix yes their contributions 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.189
 once this part is finished 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.709
 we will turn the environment protects initiatives against mace 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.059
 nothing 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.559
 thousands of the faithful of all the different 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.779
 the best way to take advantage of those are doing small 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:41.179
 now it only remains to enjoy the authentic juniper conflict
