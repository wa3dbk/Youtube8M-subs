was<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.130> was<00:01:18.250> just<00:01:18.400> such<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.910> cool<00:01:19.120> feeling<00:01:19.390> you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
was it was just such a cool feeling you

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.390 
was it was just such a cool feeling you
got<00:01:19.690> into<00:01:19.900> that<00:01:20.050> turn<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.710> right<00:01:21.100> when<00:01:21.280> it

got into that turn and right when it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.950 
got into that turn and right when it
apex<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.120> kind<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.330> wanted<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.660> grab<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
apex is just kind of wanted to grab the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.300 
apex is just kind of wanted to grab the
handful<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.410> throttle<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.010> just<00:01:24.130> feel

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
handful of throttle and you just feel

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.340 
handful of throttle and you just feel
your<00:01:24.430> suspension<00:01:25.270> just<00:01:25.420> compress<00:01:26.020> all<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
your suspension just compress all the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.530 
your suspension just compress all the
way<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:26.979> pop<00:01:27.190> straight<00:01:27.490> up<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:28.060> mean

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
way and you just pop straight up I mean

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.969 
way and you just pop straight up I mean
you'd<00:01:28.660> probably<00:01:28.690> go<00:01:29.050> as<00:01:29.229> high<00:01:29.350> as<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.560> do<00:01:29.740> far

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
you'd probably go as high as you do far

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.560
