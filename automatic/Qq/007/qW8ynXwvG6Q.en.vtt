moved down in rank to 21 k I had a
decent<00:00:23.730> enough<00:00:23.939> team<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.600> big<00:00:24.840> points<00:00:25.170> from

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

Sanchez<00:00:25.560> hazard<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.519> Austin<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.779> got

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
Sanchez hazard in Austin but I just got

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.070 
Sanchez hazard in Austin but I just got
the<00:00:27.990> captain<00:00:28.380> decision<00:00:28.800> completely<00:00:29.010> wrong

the captain decision completely wrong

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.299 
the captain decision completely wrong
retrospectively<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.470> seems<00:00:31.650> obvious<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
retrospectively it seems obvious that I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.740 
retrospectively it seems obvious that I
should<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.520> trusted<00:00:32.790> Austin<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.480> his<00:00:33.570> two

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
should have trusted Austin with his two

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260 
should have trusted Austin with his two
games<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.040> didn't<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.460> QPR<00:00:35.910> score<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
games but I just didn't see QPR score in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
games but I just didn't see QPR score in
many<00:00:36.420> goals<00:00:36.690> certainly<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:37.920> many<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.280> they

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
