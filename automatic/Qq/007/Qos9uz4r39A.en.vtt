welcome back settling here today Mojang
released<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.629> 12<00:00:03.959> w<00:00:04.319> 36<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.190> snapshot<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.779> it's

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
released the 12 w 36 a snapshot and it's

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.839 
released the 12 w 36 a snapshot and it's
got<00:00:07.350> some<00:00:07.529> pretty<00:00:07.680> cool<00:00:07.859> features<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.820> I

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
got some pretty cool features in it so I

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.040 
got some pretty cool features in it so I
thought<00:00:09.090> we'd<00:00:09.240> go<00:00:09.330> over<00:00:09.360> some<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.719> those<00:00:09.809> of

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
thought we'd go over some of those of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.589 
thought we'd go over some of those of
course<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.880> new<00:00:12.300> mob

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
course the first one here is the new mob

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.209 
course the first one here is the new mob
heads<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.200> think<00:00:13.620> these<00:00:13.679> are<00:00:13.740> supposed<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
heads I think these are supposed to be a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
heads I think these are supposed to be a
rare<00:00:14.490> mob<00:00:14.730> drops<00:00:14.940> although<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.870> honest<00:00:16.260> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
rare mob drops although to be honest I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109 
rare mob drops although to be honest I
spawned<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.190> bunch<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.430> skeletons<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:17.970> let

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
spawned a bunch of skeletons and let

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.150 
spawned a bunch of skeletons and let
them<00:00:18.270> sort<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.660> burn<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> Sun<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
them sort of burn up in the Sun and I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400 
them sort of burn up in the Sun and I
didn't<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.580> needed<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> drop<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
didn't get needed a drop so I'm not a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
didn't get needed a drop so I'm not a
hundred<00:00:22.680> percent<00:00:22.800> sure<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.490> actually

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
hundred percent sure that it's actually

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.400 
hundred percent sure that it's actually
in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> game<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> drop<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.960> maybe<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.289> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
in the game as a drop but maybe I just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
in the game as a drop but maybe I just
didn't<00:00:25.619> try<00:00:25.740> hard<00:00:25.920> enough<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.760> five<00:00:26.939> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
didn't try hard enough there's five in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.599 
didn't try hard enough there's five in
total<00:00:27.240> they're<00:00:27.480> zombie<00:00:27.930> creeper<00:00:28.710> skeleton

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
total they're zombie creeper skeleton

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.380 
total they're zombie creeper skeleton
the<00:00:29.789> new<00:00:29.970> wither<00:00:30.359> skeleton<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:32.120> Steve<00:00:33.120> head

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the new wither skeleton and Steve head

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.100 
the new wither skeleton and Steve head
and<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:35.190> guess<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.030> immerse<00:00:36.210> rare<00:00:36.809> drops

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and I guess you can immerse rare drops

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
and I guess you can immerse rare drops
probably<00:00:37.620> eventually<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> snapshot

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
probably eventually when the snapshot

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.389 
probably eventually when the snapshot
that<00:00:38.640> comes<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.110> wear<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.100> your

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that comes out if you wear one on your

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
that comes out if you wear one on your
head<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.090> actually<00:00:42.270> get<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> mask

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
head you can actually get kind of a mask

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
head you can actually get kind of a mask
effect<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> pretty<00:00:44.820> cool<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
effect going on which is pretty cool and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.080 
effect going on which is pretty cool and
otherwise<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.829> support<00:00:47.430> rotation<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> lot

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
otherwise they support rotation a lot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
otherwise they support rotation a lot
like<00:00:48.239> signs<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.230> place<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.829> they'll

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
like signs so if you place them they'll

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.930 
like signs so if you place them they'll
basically<00:00:50.550> face<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.180> which<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> pretty<00:00:52.440> cool

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
basically face you which is pretty cool

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.889 
basically face you which is pretty cool
saddle<00:00:53.940> pigs<00:00:54.180> became<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.750> more

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
saddle pigs became a little bit more

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.869 
saddle pigs became a little bit more
useful<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.949> ride<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.640> pull

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
useful now you can ride them and pull

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.420 
useful now you can ride them and pull
out<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.000> carrot<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> stick<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.250> pig

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
out your carrot on a stick and the pig

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
out your carrot on a stick and the pig
will<00:00:59.699> try<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.539> towards<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.770> basically

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
will try and go towards it so basically

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
will try and go towards it so basically
it'll<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.520> whichever<00:01:02.820> direction<00:01:03.149> you're

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it'll go whichever direction you're

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.780 
it'll go whichever direction you're
facing<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.710> also<00:01:04.830> increase<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> speed

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
facing and they also increase the speed

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
facing and they also increase the speed
of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> pigs<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> moves<00:01:06.810> long<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
of the pigs that it moves long at a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.010 
of the pigs that it moves long at a
reasonable<00:01:08.340> clip<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.630> something<00:01:09.869> like

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
reasonable clip I think something like

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
reasonable clip I think something like
five<00:01:10.290> five<00:01:10.950> miles<00:01:11.159> per<00:01:11.250> hour<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.640> something

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
five five miles per hour or something

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.390 
five five miles per hour or something
and<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.590> quite<00:01:14.010> useful<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and so that's actually quite useful you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.910 
and so that's actually quite useful you
can<00:01:14.490> use<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.479> sorts<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.259> pig<00:01:16.439> racing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
can use this for all sorts of pig racing

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210 
can use this for all sorts of pig racing
and<00:01:17.750> Mario<00:01:18.750> Kart<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.140> Minecraft<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.950> sort<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and Mario Kart a Minecraft that sort of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.719 
and Mario Kart a Minecraft that sort of
stuff

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
stuff

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
stuff
very<00:01:21.330> cool<00:01:21.780> saddled<00:01:22.380> pigs<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.040> drop

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
very cool saddled pigs also now drop

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.499 
very cool saddled pigs also now drop
their<00:01:23.520> saddle<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.090> die<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
their saddle when they die so you can

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
their saddle when they die so you can
actually<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.369> there<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> new

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
actually get that back there is a new

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually get that back there is a new
mob<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.860> wither<00:01:28.860> skeleton<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.850> saw<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
mob it's the wither skeleton you saw it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
mob it's the wither skeleton you saw it
the<00:01:30.479> head<00:01:30.689> before<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.560> actually

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the head before but you can actually

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.219 
the head before but you can actually
spawn<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> nether<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.540> like

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
spawn one in the nether by just like

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
spawn one in the nether by just like
licking<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:35.299> skeleton<00:01:36.299> spawn<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
licking your skeleton spawn and of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
licking your skeleton spawn and of
course<00:01:37.079> sometimes<00:01:38.040> they'll<00:01:38.220> spawn<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> normal

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
course sometimes they'll spawn a normal

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.420 
course sometimes they'll spawn a normal
skull<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> weird<00:01:39.720> actually

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
skull so I'm just kind of weird actually

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
skull so I'm just kind of weird actually
but<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.090> guys<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.290> wither

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
skeletons if you go ahead and kill them

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.469 
skeletons if you go ahead and kill them
they'll<00:01:45.720> drop<00:01:46.460> drop<00:01:47.460> anything<00:01:47.700> they'll<00:01:48.299> drop

they'll drop drop anything they'll drop

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.950 
they'll drop drop anything they'll drop
bones<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.259> coal<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.479> bones<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bones and coal there we go bones and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
bones and coal there we go bones and
coal<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.579> sometimes<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.759> also<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> rare

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
coal and sometimes they also have a rare

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
coal and sometimes they also have a rare
drop<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.710> nether<00:01:56.159> star

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
drop which is the nether star

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
drop which is the nether star
here's<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.200> looking<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.620> in<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
here's look at it looking up in the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
here's look at it looking up in the
creative<00:01:58.950> inventory<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.610> actually<00:01:59.880> used

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
creative inventory this is actually used

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.430 
creative inventory this is actually used
for<00:02:00.150> crafting<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.810> beacon<00:02:01.170> block<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:03.440> the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
for crafting the beacon block but the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.830 
for crafting the beacon block but the
yeah<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.550> weather<00:02:05.730> skeletons<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.360> kind<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
yeah the weather skeletons are kind of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
yeah the weather skeletons are kind of
nasty<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:08.130> don't<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.430> bow<00:02:08.670> but

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
nasty because they don't have a bow but

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.350 
nasty because they don't have a bow but
if<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:10.200> hit<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.060> wither

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
if they do hit you you get that wither

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.710 
if they do hit you you get that wither
poison<00:02:12.870> effect<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:14.640> slowly<00:02:15.180> poisons

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
poison effect that that slowly poisons

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.550 
poison effect that that slowly poisons
you<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:18.420> may<00:02:18.630> actually<00:02:18.780> heal<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you and and it may actually heal the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.180 
you and and it may actually heal the
wither<00:02:20.340> skeleton<00:02:20.790> rusher<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:23.070> yeah

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
wither skeleton rusher but but yeah

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.560 
wither skeleton rusher but but yeah
they're<00:02:23.400> they're<00:02:23.700> necessary<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> new

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
they're they're necessary for the new

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.050 
they're they're necessary for the new
you<00:02:25.350> know<00:02:25.440> wither<00:02:25.620> skulls<00:02:26.010> probably<00:02:26.910> hitting

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you know wither skulls probably hitting

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.370 
you know wither skulls probably hitting
them<00:02:27.240> with<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.450> sword<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:28.020> makes<00:02:28.230> them

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
them with a sword is what makes them

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.360 
them with a sword is what makes them
drop<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.370> actual<00:02:30.360> skull<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
drop the the actual skull and the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.130 
drop the the actual skull and the
withers<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> nether<00:02:33.300> star<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
withers they're the nether star for the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.590 
withers they're the nether star for the
beacon<00:02:34.350> block<00:02:34.940> speaking<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.150> beacon

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
beacon block speaking of that beacon

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 
beacon block speaking of that beacon
actually<00:02:37.530> had<00:02:37.620> my<00:02:37.740> facts<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.100> little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.370> wrong

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
actually had my facts a little bit wrong

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.250 
actually had my facts a little bit wrong
that<00:02:38.820> nether<00:02:39.060> star<00:02:39.150> item<00:02:39.480> doesn't<00:02:39.900> come<00:02:40.020> from

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that nether star item doesn't come from

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.960 
that nether star item doesn't come from
the<00:02:40.320> wither<00:02:40.770> skeleton<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> comes<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
the wither skeleton it comes from the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.840 
the wither skeleton it comes from the
wither<00:02:42.770> sort<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> boss<00:02:43.980> itself<00:02:44.459> which<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
wither sort of boss itself which is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.640 
wither sort of boss itself which is
actually<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.209> called<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.390> wither<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.200> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
actually just called a wither but you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.220 
actually just called a wither but you
can<00:02:46.800> use<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.310> craft<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.970> beacon<00:02:48.840> just

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can use that to craft the beacon just

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.170 
can use that to craft the beacon just
put<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> middle<00:02:49.680> five<00:02:50.520> blasts<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
put it in the middle five blasts and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.920 
put it in the middle five blasts and
three<00:02:51.600> obsidian<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.620> get<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.070> beacon<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
three obsidian you get that beacon and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.060 
three obsidian you get that beacon and
it<00:02:55.080> actually<00:02:55.380> looks<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.650> bit<00:02:55.830> cooler

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
it actually looks a little bit cooler

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.190 
it actually looks a little bit cooler
now<00:02:56.220> than<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.640> did<00:02:56.670> before<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> beam

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
now than it did before you get the beam

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.010 
now than it did before you get the beam
up<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> sky<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> put<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.430> top<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.700> a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
up to the sky if you put it on top of a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.560 
up to the sky if you put it on top of a
pyramid<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.489> blocks<00:03:02.489> some<00:03:03.120> sort<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.330> metal

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
pyramid of blocks some sort of metal

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.759 
pyramid of blocks some sort of metal
blocks<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:06.200> if<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.500> give<00:03:07.650> myself

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
blocks and you can if I just give myself

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.770 
blocks and you can if I just give myself
a<00:03:08.010> diamond<00:03:08.250> real<00:03:08.370> quick<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.239> still<00:03:09.600> use

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
a diamond real quick you can still use

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.090 
a diamond real quick you can still use
it<00:03:09.989> just<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.470> did<00:03:10.560> before

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
it just like you did before

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.960 
it just like you did before
and<00:03:12.050> when<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> do<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.610> when<00:03:14.610> you're<00:03:14.760> near

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
and when you do that when you're near

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.630 
and when you do that when you're near
the<00:03:15.000> beacon<00:03:15.959> you'll<00:03:16.200> get<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.739> effect<00:03:17.519> that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the beacon you'll get the effect that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.470 
the beacon you'll get the effect that
you<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.350> beacon<00:03:19.590> block<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.760> yeah<00:03:21.300> that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
you but in the beacon block so yeah that

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.330 
you but in the beacon block so yeah that
comes<00:03:21.630> though<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.290> nether<00:03:22.500> star<00:03:22.560> comes<00:03:22.980> from

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
comes though the nether star comes from

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.560 
comes though the nether star comes from
the<00:03:23.760> wither<00:03:25.010> wither<00:03:26.010> itself<00:03:26.610> which<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> much

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
the wither wither itself which is much

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.680 
the wither wither itself which is much
more<00:03:27.750> difficult<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.230> obtain<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.739> would<00:03:28.920> say

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
more difficult to obtain I would say

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.540 
more difficult to obtain I would say
superflat<00:03:30.690> world<00:03:31.019> terrain<00:03:31.830> generation<00:03:32.340> has

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
superflat world terrain generation has

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.120 
superflat world terrain generation has
been<00:03:32.580> modified<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.360> bit<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.769> instead<00:03:35.070> of

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
been modified a bit so that instead of

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.430 
been modified a bit so that instead of
having<00:03:35.340> say<00:03:35.670> bedrock<00:03:36.300> dirt<00:03:36.600> dirt<00:03:36.870> dirt<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
having say bedrock dirt dirt dirt you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.740 
having say bedrock dirt dirt dirt you
can<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.830> whatever<00:03:38.580> different<00:03:39.300> layers<00:03:39.510> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
can have whatever different layers you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.720 
can have whatever different layers you
want<00:03:39.959> going<00:03:40.170> all<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.470> way<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.739> 256<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
want going all the way up to 256 and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.030 
want going all the way up to 256 and
what<00:03:42.570> I've<00:03:42.690> done<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.230> I've<00:03:43.500> actually<00:03:43.680> set

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
what I've done here is I've actually set

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.390 
what I've done here is I've actually set
it<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.060> layer<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.420> air<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.019> in<00:03:46.739> this

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it to just a layer of air so in this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.530 
it to just a layer of air so in this
case<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:47.760> actually<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.150> going<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.330> spawn

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
case it's actually not going to spawn

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.220 
case it's actually not going to spawn
any<00:03:48.780> terrain

I<00:03:49.410> took<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.590> or<00:03:50.130> Mille<00:03:50.280> superflat<00:03:50.670> world<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
I took a or Mille superflat world and

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.460 
I took a or Mille superflat world and
modified<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.310> NBT<00:03:53.340> data<00:03:53.850> file<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.570> did<00:03:55.260> this

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
modified the NBT data file and did this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.949 
modified the NBT data file and did this
it's<00:03:56.220> there's<00:03:56.610> no<00:03:56.820> way<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.630> easily

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it's there's no way to do this easily

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.810 
it's there's no way to do this easily
from<00:03:58.950> any<00:03:59.160> sort<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.459> GUI

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you have to actually edit the file

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.170 
you have to actually edit the file
itself<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.690> linked<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.860> post<00:04:05.700> by<00:04:05.940> dinner

itself but I linked to a post by dinner

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.910 
itself but I linked to a post by dinner
poem<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.569> says<00:04:06.780> sort<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.590> how<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.770> could<00:04:07.830> do

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
poem that says sort of how you could do

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.710 
poem that says sort of how you could do
that<00:04:08.040> if<00:04:08.220> you're<00:04:08.340> familiar<00:04:08.520> with<00:04:08.790> editing<00:04:09.270> NBT

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
that if you're familiar with editing NBT

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.059 
that if you're familiar with editing NBT
structures<00:04:10.290> but

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
structures but

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.380 
structures but
is<00:04:11.189> really<00:04:11.370> cool<00:04:11.519> format<00:04:11.819> makers<00:04:12.090> because<00:04:12.329> it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
is really cool format makers because it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.839 
is really cool format makers because it
allows<00:04:12.629> us<00:04:12.659> to<00:04:13.170> create<00:04:14.040> maps<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.609> won't

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
allows us to create maps that won't

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.490 
allows us to create maps that won't
generate<00:04:15.209> any<00:04:15.389> new<00:04:15.689> terrain<00:04:16.019> them<00:04:16.289> in<00:04:16.410> our

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
generate any new terrain them in our

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.210 
generate any new terrain them in our
fire<00:04:16.680> yacht<00:04:16.949> how<00:04:17.789> far<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.389> go<00:04:18.630> which<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.440> which

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
fire yacht how far you go which is which

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.590 
fire yacht how far you go which is which
is<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.340> really<00:04:20.489> cool<00:04:20.549> feature<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:21.120> means<00:04:21.329> that

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
is a really cool feature it means that

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.990 
is a really cool feature it means that
the<00:04:21.750> map<00:04:21.930> sizes<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.310> smaller<00:04:23.580> because<00:04:23.789> you

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
the map sizes can be smaller because you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.400 
the map sizes can be smaller because you
don't<00:04:24.150> need<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.330> include<00:04:24.449> a<00:04:24.690> bunch<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.080> empty

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
don't need to include a bunch of empty

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.400 
don't need to include a bunch of empty
chunks<00:04:25.770> outside<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.330> core<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.259> map

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
chunks outside of the core of the map

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.890 
chunks outside of the core of the map
itself<00:04:28.800> very<00:04:29.490> cool<00:04:29.639> all<00:04:30.300> right<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.690> last

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
itself very cool all right so the last

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.719 
itself very cool all right so the last
feature<00:04:31.199> I'm<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> get<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.919> for<00:04:32.340> this

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
and yeah it's uh it's gonna be quite

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.800

difficult<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.819> kill<00:06:19.939> you<00:06:20.120> might<00:06:20.270> have<00:06:20.479> you

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
difficult to kill you might have you

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.540 
difficult to kill you might have you
might<00:06:20.840> find<00:06:21.199> some<00:06:21.409> way<00:06:21.499> to<00:06:21.529> trap<00:06:21.860> it<00:06:22.099> and<00:06:22.279> and

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
might find some way to trap it and and

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.429 
might find some way to trap it and and
kind<00:06:23.539> of<00:06:23.569> like<00:06:23.689> I<00:06:23.779> did<00:06:23.960> in<00:06:24.139> my<00:06:24.169> timer<00:06:24.949> video<00:06:25.340> but

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
kind of like I did in my timer video but

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.629 
kind of like I did in my timer video but
that's<00:06:27.439> quite<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:27.800> difficult<00:06:27.949> test<00:06:28.279> so<00:06:28.490> if<00:06:28.550> you

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
that's quite a difficult test so if you

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.100 
that's quite a difficult test so if you
want<00:06:28.819> to<00:06:28.879> build<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.270> beacon<00:06:29.629> yourself

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
want to build that beacon yourself

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.769 
want to build that beacon yourself
you're<00:06:30.740> gonna<00:06:30.830> need<00:06:31.039> to<00:06:31.189> work<00:06:31.310> pretty<00:06:31.580> hard

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
you're gonna need to work pretty hard

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.700

for the snapshot it's got a lot of great

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.879 
for the snapshot it's got a lot of great
features<00:06:35.629> I'm<00:06:36.139> really<00:06:36.409> liking<00:06:36.650> what<00:06:36.680> they're

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
doing with a lot of these and I think

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:40.659 
doing with a lot of these and I think
they're<00:06:39.650> gonna<00:06:39.770> impact<00:06:40.039> survive<00:06:40.370> holding

they're gonna impact survive holding
some<00:06:40.789> really<00:06:40.969> cool<00:06:41.060> ways<00:06:41.270> so<00:06:42.199> that's<00:06:42.469> about<00:06:42.589> it

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800
