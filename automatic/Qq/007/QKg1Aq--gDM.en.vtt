00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.430
 well I'm stimulation warcraft to do 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.670
 a guide to how to climb dreamer from 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.129
 1 to 600 is a fairly easy profession 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.469
 that gives us a passive one hit 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.170
 critical to start will not give us the same 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.490
 lord of the covenant for the horde the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.310
 same hard help tank between 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.090
 tears from about 72 the first 75 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.670
 points though it will be killing and pigs there 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.980
 raptors there are scorpions besides giving 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.660
 those bugs waiting for them in the zones 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.460
 that marks you here I put an arrow 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 because from the bottom they are less 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.670
 level and the top level 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.559
 start from the bottom up and in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.420
 wing forest for the alliance to the side 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.249
 in the storm the area where I was in 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 killing storm or any beast that 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.559
 there were only wolves in the area that you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 framework of the center has less level and 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.649
 the left and right have more level 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.999
 the bugs taking advantage of the same start 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.409
 from the center to either side 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.850
 of 76 650 and so yes to the caves of 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.739
 the laments that are in the wastelands 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.510
 North in each indoor is a cave 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.550
 we will go in killing all the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.550
 factors that we find ourselves will go 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.530
 going down the cave killing 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.090
 There will come a time that we will arrive at a 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.280
 door a dungeon that weening every time 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.320
 we enter the dungeon we will go killing 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 more time the first nothing more we see 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 the large room of the cave there is a 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 bunch of raptors too and when 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.930
 we finish that rapture we can go by 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.520
 down to the part on the left there is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.740
 a lot of snakes to it not 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.810
 they end and also morresi uploaded to 150 or 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.580
 it's going pretty well from a room 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.800
 ago from 76 to 150 from 151 to 225 he gave me 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.410
 kill draco leonesa was scraped what is 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.480
 about the northern wastelands are in 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.880
 the area is that it marked the truth that 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.820
 there's no exaggeration two but they have a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.630
 very timely response of reappearance very 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.340
 short 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.840
 I would say that seconds in some that 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.540
 He even killed it while waiting for it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.550
 not in return series we do the is a 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.350
 ramp hands ramp up and down 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.000
 when we get downstairs if we give ourselves the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.170
 back they will be but we go up 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 flying and then we do again and so 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.610
 all the rap bread goes up pretty fast 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 and already up to 300 measured to the dungeon 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.679
 the massacre is in 'ferraz' there are three 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 the more you dwell the one that is farther north and more 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.470
 enter like a pit and it's full of 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.150
 full 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 all full we do a little bit of air 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.000
 and we agreed that the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.560
 dungeons you can only do five 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 times per hour once we wait for it 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 we all left, we restarted with the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.650
 five times I have had enough but if 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.270
 you see that the fifth time you're not going to get 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.220
 at 300 you can go to the end of the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.870
 dungeon and down the road and both to the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 end there is a lot more filled in a 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.270
 couple of rooms to finish uploading to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.280
 300 from skiing you start 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.260
 do a little heavier because before 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.930
 for each bug we fought, they almost gave us 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.370
 a point yes or yes - in green now 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.709
 even if they are in red we can expect a 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.910
 bug and that does not give us skill point 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.830
 well here we have to go 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.950
 attracting in the corresponding area of 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.020
 300 to 330 to the peninsula of fire 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.850
 infernal there they were killing pigs by 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.300
 that area that marked us 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.060
 there are many the only thing that if you want to go a 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.130
 little quicker to 315 you can go more 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.050
 to the left of the map that the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.670
 bugs more level and you will take more than 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.170
 are in red instead of yellow that 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.080
 they give a little bit the same but maybe 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.560
 arrays two or three minutes of time two 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 or three dots with 330 skill I've already 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.930
 gone to the great to kill is looks and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.660
 beasts I have some beasts these big 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.340
 which are like those of starwars up to 375 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.880
 that already we already finished with what 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.980
 corresponds to the expansion of beyond 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.540
 They are in the area around San Marcos 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.520
 to get a map discovered but good 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 spare to know where the bugs are 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.630
 in a lot of the trees in many 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.620
 is looks if you want you can be up 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.720
 360 and 360 instead of 375 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.720
 as you wish it does not cost much those 15 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.730
 points you can go now to the north race that 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.680
 the next area to the northern tundra to 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.240
 kill rhinos that as you see are 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.890
 in very large groups you make one very 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.070
 tiny but it's a lot and here 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.880
 we are killing rhinos of 375 or 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.160
 360 what you have chosen up to 400 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.650
 in this area that marked here there 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.530
 very many groups of five or six 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
 rhinos are killed enough they are not 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.180
 very easy and peels very fast to be 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.150
 goes up very fast and when we have 400 of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.100
 400 to 450 skill and the account of 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.250
 work that is the place that I think that 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.050
 more beasts to peel from all the wow me 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.510
 was killing some monkeys that are in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.400
 the area is here that marked these 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.680
 monkeys are in groups a few monkeys 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.080
 whites there is a group of four to six 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.350
 and then there are a few black loose 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.850
 so there is more than one peeling killing said 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.580
 of this the truth that you fall short 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.200
 but there are thousands of beasts in the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.930
 salazar basin so you can go to 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.150
 any other site to kill bug with 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.370
 450 of skill has already gone to the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.330
 twilight highlands I've been 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.360
 up to 470 killing 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.370
 faucets are in the area stand to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.919
 frame there are a lot of bugs to kill 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
 they peel a lot more you have to take out 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.689
 20 dots is done in a moment and already 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.699
 with 470 no more than old age tulle 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.860
 cheap but at old age what inside and 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.539
 we will be killing crocodiles up to 500 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.669
 that already what the panda song plays 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.139
 area to the crocodiles to the receiver rod 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.030
 not very big but like here where they are 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.340
 there are very many we can be several 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.349
 killing without problems will respond fast 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.780
 and with 500 skill points already 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.789
 we are going to kill turtles but 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.129
 where they kill turtles up in home theme 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.289
 in the valley of the four winds 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.909
 we will be there up to 560 on the screen and 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.460
 each one can choose your path 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.080
 over with 560 you're almost done 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.419
 because everything peel any bug from 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.789
 pandaria so I do not stop anymore 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.490
 but if you want to finish up to 600 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.020
 you can go to the desert of dread 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.029
 zone until a frame to kill 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.210
 scorpions a large scorpions 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.919
 they go out a lot there are enough and there 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.130
 a single person there is no problem 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.080
 you never run out of bugs 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.510
 11 you can also do an expansion of 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.400
 whole arborretum padaria I think it is 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.139
 where is the limbo dragon order 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.940
 to the right on the island where they are made 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.770
 the daily ones of that reputation there is a 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.090
 area that is full of small turtles 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.650
 and great the small ones you can 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.510
 start to peel since that panda 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.340
 and the big ones with more level you start 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.139
 killing small that very many and 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.639
 when you can see you can see that you can 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.650
 peel the big little fights and 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.210
 great if you go up in a moment but this 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.060
 it's the two roads are equally good 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.400
 so if you want to know the areas 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.950
 where to go skinner I hope that the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.280
 video serve you like it and tomorrow more up 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.280
 morning
