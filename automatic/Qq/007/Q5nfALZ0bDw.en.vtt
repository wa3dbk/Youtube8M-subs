a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.979> interior<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.850> black

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
a little bit the interior of the black

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.090 
a little bit the interior of the black
multi<00:02:09.420> color<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.810> more<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
multi color is more of a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.000 
multi color is more of a
pink<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.580> guess<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.260> interior<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
pink I guess and then the interior of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.830 
pink I guess and then the interior of
the<00:02:14.460> white<00:02:14.640> multi<00:02:15.000> color<00:02:15.210> has<00:02:15.450> more<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the white multi color has more of a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.890 
the white multi color has more of a
purple<00:02:16.230> tone<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
purple tone so I do really like that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.680 
purple tone so I do really like that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
insolent wallet in the I believe it was

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.540 
insolent wallet in the I believe it was
the<00:02:29.730> regular<00:02:30.180> monogram<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.110> she<00:02:32.070> showed<00:02:32.520> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you could leave it snapped because the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.100 
you could leave it snapped because the
main<00:02:34.590> way<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> open<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.540> these<00:02:36.750> snaps

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
main way to open it is with these snaps

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.110 
main way to open it is with these snaps
here<00:02:37.380> at<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> side<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> could<00:02:38.820> actually

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
here at the side but you could actually

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.290 
here at the side but you could actually
still<00:02:40.080> put<00:02:40.320> things<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.770> your<00:02:41.040> phone<00:02:41.370> died<00:02:42.150> in

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300

this<00:02:42.390> main<00:02:42.690> zipper<00:02:43.080> compartment<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:43.920> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
this main zipper compartment and I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.350 
this main zipper compartment and I
thought<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.460> was<00:02:44.640> really<00:02:44.940> handy

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
thought that that was really handy

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240 
thought that that was really handy
that's<00:02:45.960> actually<00:02:46.410> one<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> reasons<00:02:47.040> why<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that's actually one of the reasons why I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.130 
that's actually one of the reasons why I
ended<00:02:47.460> up<00:02:47.670> wanting<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.120> try<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.570> then<00:02:48.780> sew<00:02:48.990> it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
ended up wanting to try out then sew it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.740 
ended up wanting to try out then sew it
while<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.310> seemed<00:02:51.000> very<00:02:51.360> like

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
while it because it seemed very like

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.110 
while it because it seemed very like

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.170 
possibilities I guess it's just a vomit
and<00:03:07.800> its<00:03:08.130> ability<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.610> be<00:03:08.880> very

compartment and then use this larger one
actually<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.220> things<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.490> my<00:03:23.730> phone<00:03:24.000> or

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
actually for things like my phone or

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.660 
actually for things like my phone or
things<00:03:24.990> i<00:03:25.140> wanted<00:03:25.380> quicker<00:03:25.650> easier<00:03:25.920> access<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
things i wanted quicker easier access to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.460 
things i wanted quicker easier access to
so<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.450> like<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.170> keep<00:03:28.320> my

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
so I do really like that if you keep my

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.250 
so I do really like that if you keep my
change<00:03:28.740> separate<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.300> it's<00:03:30.450> got<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.840> ton

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
change separate and then it's got a ton

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.640 
change separate and then it's got a ton
of<00:03:31.820> card<00:03:32.820> places<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.660> got<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.050> 12<00:03:34.290> card

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
i get a chance to use it a little bit

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.610 
i get a chance to use it a little bit
but<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.360> know<00:03:57.450> i<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.080> it<00:03:58.200> has<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.350> lot

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
initial thoughts on the insolent wallet

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.680 
initial thoughts on the insolent wallet
is<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.960> very<00:04:31.470> big<00:04:31.770> wallet<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.060> have<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.510> like

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
is a very big wallet so you have to like

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.250 
is a very big wallet so you have to like
big<00:04:33.960> wallets<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.410> go<00:04:34.680> with<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:36.510> do<00:04:36.990> think

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
big wallets to go with it and I do think

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.140 
big wallets to go with it and I do think
that<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.710> very<00:04:37.920> multi<00:04:38.370> functional<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.030> it's

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
that it's very multi functional but it's

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.330 
that it's very multi functional but it's
also<00:04:39.330> very<00:04:39.720> different<00:04:40.410> from<00:04:40.530> anything<00:04:40.890> that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
also very different from anything that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.480 
also very different from anything that
I've<00:04:41.730> used<00:04:41.760> most<00:04:42.390> recently<00:04:43.340> obviously<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
I've used most recently obviously the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.040 
I've used most recently obviously the
Sarah<00:04:44.760> wall<00:04:44.970> has<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.210> different<00:04:45.570> opening<00:04:45.900> and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
Sarah wall has a different opening and

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.930 
Sarah wall has a different opening and
that<00:04:46.140> sort<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.470> thing<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:47.130> it's<00:04:47.280> very<00:04:47.580> very

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
that sort of thing but it's very very

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.240
