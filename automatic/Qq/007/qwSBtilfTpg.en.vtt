00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.300
 view february sony entertainment 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.969

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.700
 and finally this week your move in 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.030
 the future made the last and biggest 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 player 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.210
 big industrial threesome corporation 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.210
 microsoft 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.000
 the fact that the new console will be able to almost 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.580
 all play movies on blu-ray 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.950
 be friends with online music services 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.059
 cinemas and of course run games 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.489
 generations next 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.200
 hardly a real secret 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.820
 protected secrets remained itself 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.100
 name home consoles 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.140
 intrigue has been preserved until the last 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.590
 minutes and resolved gracefully 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.830
 video center and u van van all-in-one will 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.090
 to the market under the brand and xbox one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.750
 microsoft presented not gaming 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 console 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.700
 they showed a device which 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.700
 accumulates all digital entertainment 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.369
 inside of itself and is a kind of digital 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.039
 center of your apartment and within here 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.500
 this concept title is just fine 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.070
 now the console is a powerful multimedia 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.440
 a center that combines everything 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 It seems to me that the name xbox one is over 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.930
 about the same stupid as new ipad 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.600
 Well, that is what is on live, however, as 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.149
 It called on tysche next new new 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.759
 ipad here as well as so the following 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.130
 use already have the first xbox up 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.170
 the very first xbox if you type on u 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 tuba is the name then first 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.349
 naturally some video comes out 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.479
 and starmaxx tug do not name prices yet 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.640
 console i have all my main workings in 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.310
 igroprome microsoft hides under one 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.039
 body motion controller kinect will 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.369
 embedded in xbox one forming a symbiosis with 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.560
 interface version 20 more precisely and smarter 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.480
 predecessor now kinect by eye 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.230
 determines the weight of the player and even 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.930
 controls his heart and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 that is, in this console everything is tied up 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.650
 around the kinect she can control her voice 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.590
 gestures you can switch instantly with 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.840
 games on the movie call on skype while you 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.430
 do you watch a movie well here is a serious fight and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.230
 imagine the situation when you 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.510
 watching a movie and you need to call in 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.459
 as you put the movie on pause and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.590
 will talk on skype will be from 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.440
 on the x-box or on the ipad next to it 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.260
 notes you don't make any difference 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.230
 the course is taken on the convergence of the console and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.510
 television is not the television itself and on 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.670
 television it is traced very 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.070
 Clearly the first games that showed 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.520
 there were sports projects from electronics 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.660
 arts 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.850
 This is a direct link with the most rated. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 gears to an american chemist 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.220
 sports matches voice control 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.990
 multitasking need if not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.820
 regular regular exchange 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.920
 data with the internet all this 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.020
 required attribute i am interactive 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.030
 next to get used to new 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.890
 technology is difficult even for gamers and 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.310
 fotozhaba and taunts all these only 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.710
 underline the next-gen sample 2013 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 reforming not so much the game as 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.740
 gaming audience at the console left 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.050
 just a few years to give 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.150
 users 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.790
 get used to the service to denote 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.130
 user importance console because 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.250
 in five to seven years all the power that 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.080
 Now you are identified by the console 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.910
 with tv 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.660
 will be very easy to integrate into yourself 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.730
 television 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.780
 why do you need to be extra when 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.180
 5 years old 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.140
 the player cannot be explained if they 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.200
 accustomed not now come to this console 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.750
 really new microsoft audience 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
 came up with a way how to attract add 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.890
 game console series and sport 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.800
 stop calling her 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.280
 game console start selling it in 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.530
 department with irons and they will be happy 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.299
 of macros, it seemed that ixbox one 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.820
 will be of interest to the whole family 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.220
 if there is no multitasking big 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.050
 wedge family do not click will be a struggle for 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.760
 TV, these are quite probably something 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.100
 microsoft wants but if microsoft 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.050
 will make a normal 1 pair June laziness 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.090
 process and you can put a monument 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.010
 naturally the presentation ends 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.669
 what is called on the most interesting place 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.169
 movie new call of duty flaunts 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.419
 inhuman detail literally 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.580
 special emphasis is placed on the image 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.040
 Sheepdogs visible even the scars on 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.870
 muzzles but not only graphic delights 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.340
 gainers waiting for consoles of the eighth 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.780
