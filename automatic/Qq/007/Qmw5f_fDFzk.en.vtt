00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
definitely get practice guys I mean just

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.249 
definitely get practice guys I mean just
play<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> game<00:01:53.460> you'll<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.570> great<00:01:54.810> practice

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
play the game you'll get great practice

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.039 
play the game you'll get great practice
if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> play<00:01:55.740> snipers<00:01:56.250> enough<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.049> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
if you play snipers enough and you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.440 
if you play snipers enough and you
usually<00:01:58.200> will<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> Halo<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
usually will because this is a Halo and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.200 
usually will because this is a Halo and
people<00:02:01.320> love<00:02:01.439> snipers<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.159> also<00:02:02.369> don't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
people love snipers and then also don't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.980 
people love snipers and then also don't
stand<00:02:03.540> still<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.590> um<00:02:04.829> ties<00:02:05.250> into

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
stand still I know that um ties into

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.240 
stand still I know that um ties into
what<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.890> said<00:02:08.759> earlier<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:10.250> avoiding

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
what I just said earlier about avoiding

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
what I just said earlier about avoiding
people<00:02:12.209> by<00:02:12.510> strafing<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
people by strafing but

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760 
people by strafing but
don't<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.730> guy<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.330> killed<00:02:15.770> as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
don't be that guy that I just killed as

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.470 
don't be that guy that I just killed as
you<00:02:17.040> are<00:02:17.160> watching<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.610> next<00:02:17.910> kill<00:02:18.120> once<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
you are watching this next kill once you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
you are watching this next kill once you
guys<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.870> ask<00:02:19.080> yourself<00:02:19.620> Who<00:02:19.830> am<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.040> gonna

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
guys to ask yourself Who am I gonna

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.850 
guys to ask yourself Who am I gonna
shoot<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.580> which<00:02:20.730> guy<00:02:20.940> am<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.239> gonna<00:02:21.650> cap<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
shoot at which guy am I gonna cap in the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
shoot at which guy am I gonna cap in the
face<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.970> we're<00:02:24.060> gonna<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.300> onto<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.630> first

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
face so we're gonna go onto this first

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.050 
face so we're gonna go onto this first
guy<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.890> probably<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.550> gonna<00:02:26.670> hit<00:02:26.849> him

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
guy really probably not gonna hit him

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.720 
guy really probably not gonna hit him
because<00:02:27.239> he's<00:02:27.569> already<00:02:28.050> falling<00:02:28.560> down<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.160> not

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
because he's already falling down so not

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.090 
because he's already falling down so not
really<00:02:30.360> shouldn't<00:02:30.600> take<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.870> shot<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:32.069> I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
really shouldn't take that shot then I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.949 
really shouldn't take that shot then I
got<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.610> other<00:02:32.760> guy<00:02:33.000> who<00:02:33.030> was<00:02:33.300> jumping<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
got this other guy who was jumping in

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.530 
got this other guy who was jumping in
the<00:02:34.050> air<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.530> probably<00:02:35.220> small<00:02:36.209> chance<00:02:36.450> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the air and probably small chance of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.270 
the air and probably small chance of
hitting<00:02:36.840> him<00:02:36.989> too<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.530> shouldn't<00:02:37.950> take<00:02:38.160> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
hitting him too so shouldn't take that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.080 
hitting him too so shouldn't take that
shot<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.390> finally<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.140> guy<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
shot then finally the guy that I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.400 
shot then finally the guy that I
actually<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.390> end<00:02:42.569> up<00:02:42.690> shooting<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> one

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
actually do end up shooting is the one

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
actually do end up shooting is the one
you<00:02:43.500> should<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.769> picked<00:02:43.920> because<00:02:44.310> he's<00:02:44.580> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you should have picked because he's I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
you should have picked because he's I
mean<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.480> generally<00:02:45.989> close<00:02:46.319> her<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.739> that's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
mean you generally close her and that's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
mean you generally close her and that's
probably<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.610> smartest<00:02:48.060> choice<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> got<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
probably the smartest choice so I got a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.289 
probably the smartest choice so I got a
bonus<00:02:52.019> clip<00:02:52.319> for<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> guys<00:02:52.709> right<00:02:53.069> now<00:02:53.299> this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.610 
is a collateral that I thought maybe I
got<00:02:57.360> or<00:02:57.510> maybe<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.780> didn't<00:02:58.110> watch<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.530> the
