00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.390 
transformation is very simple first
thing<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.720> back<00:02:24.990> section

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
thing you do is this back section

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.770 
thing you do is this back section
there's<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.610> some<00:02:26.820> little<00:02:27.060> sliders<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
there's like some little sliders you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.610 
there's like some little sliders you
just<00:02:27.960> pull<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.800> down<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.080> unclick

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
just pull it down and then it unclick

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.190 
just pull it down and then it unclick
sand<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.340> rotate<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.900> so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
sand then you just rotate down like so

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.980 
sand then you just rotate down like so
and<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.850> transform<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> legs<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and to the transform the legs you just

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.390 
and to the transform the legs you just
separate<00:02:37.880> then<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:39.270> end<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
separate then on the back end is this

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.180 
separate then on the back end is this
bring<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.490> down<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.950> white

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
bring it down like that then the white

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.520 
bring it down like that then the white
bit<00:02:44.460> will<00:02:45.120> gray<00:02:45.330> whether<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.870> comes<00:02:46.320> up

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit will gray whether it is comes up

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.840 
bit will gray whether it is comes up
like<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> same<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.660> one<00:02:49.850> bring

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
like so so do the same in this one bring

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.570 
like so so do the same in this one bring
the<00:02:50.970> foot<00:02:51.210> round<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.560> basically<00:02:53.130> there's<00:02:53.460> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the foot round and basically there's the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.840 
the foot round and basically there's the
legs<00:02:55.220> stands<00:02:56.220> fine<00:02:56.580> no<00:02:56.880> problems<00:02:57.240> with<00:02:57.330> that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
legs stands fine no problems with that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.470 
legs stands fine no problems with that
next<00:02:59.850> thing<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.740> these<00:03:01.740> two<00:03:02.210> bits<00:03:03.210> of

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
next thing you do is these two bits of

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.010 
next thing you do is these two bits of
the<00:03:03.570> turret<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.860> pegged<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:06.020> underneath

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
the turret there pegged in underneath

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.370 
the turret there pegged in underneath
and<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> side<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.050> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
and to the side so you just have to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.640 
and to the side so you just have to
unpack<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.550> both<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.270> them<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.960> that<00:03:12.990> then<00:03:13.290> come

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
unpack it both of them so that then come

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.150 
unpack it both of them so that then come
loose<00:03:13.860> Cyrus<00:03:14.640> off<00:03:14.790> camera<00:03:15.500> after<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.950> peg

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
loose Cyrus off camera after one peg

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
loose Cyrus off camera after one peg
them<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.520> they<00:03:17.640> come<00:03:17.910> loose<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.410> then

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
them so they come loose like this then

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.250 
them so they come loose like this then
you<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:21.320> rotate<00:03:22.320> them<00:03:22.530> both<00:03:23.960> so<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.050> got<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
you just rotate them both so you got it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.010 
you just rotate them both so you got it
in<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.530> position<00:03:26.270> then<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.480> whole<00:03:27.720> section

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
in this position then this whole section

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.310 
in this position then this whole section
here<00:03:28.310> rotates<00:03:29.310> around<00:03:29.840> make<00:03:30.840> sure<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.080> arms

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
here rotates around make sure the arms

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.110 
here rotates around make sure the arms
don't<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:31.770> way<00:03:31.800> bring<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.700> around<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
don't get in the way bring it around and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.990 
don't get in the way bring it around and
then<00:03:33.150> its<00:03:33.360> source<00:03:33.690> it's<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.350> some<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:35.000> it's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
then its source it's in some little it's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.760 
then its source it's in some little it's
got<00:03:36.330> some<00:03:36.480> little<00:03:36.750> things<00:03:37.020> underneath<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
got some little things underneath the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.290 
got some little things underneath the
plate<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.250> sort<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:38.580> keep<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.030> place<00:03:39.270> a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
plate that sort of keep it in place a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.600 
plate that sort of keep it in place a
little<00:03:39.630> bit<00:03:39.810> then<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.710> bring<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.010> arm<00:03:41.040> down

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
little bit then you bring the arm down

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.510 
little bit then you bring the arm down
and<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.660> arm<00:03:42.840> goes<00:03:43.530> into<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.860> hole<00:03:44.220> there

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
and the arm goes into that hole there

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.980 
and the arm goes into that hole there
and<00:03:44.760> pushes<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.810> slightly<00:03:46.640> both<00:03:47.640> sides<00:03:48.150> rotate

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
and pushes in slightly both sides rotate

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.320 
and pushes in slightly both sides rotate
around<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.430> you've<00:03:50.580> got<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> fists<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> right

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
around so you've got the fists the right

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.440 
around so you've got the fists the right
way<00:03:51.420> around<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.490> this<00:03:53.490> one<00:03:53.730> has<00:03:53.940> not<00:03:54.090> got<00:03:54.300> no

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
way around and this one has not got no

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.700 
way around and this one has not got no
bend<00:03:54.690> at<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.050> elbow<00:03:55.610> because<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.710> weapon

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
bend at the elbow because of the weapon

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.570 
bend at the elbow because of the weapon
but<00:03:59.660> this<00:04:00.660> one<00:04:00.870> has<00:04:01.020> got<00:04:01.230> goes<00:04:02.160> up<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
but this one has got goes up at the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.190 
but this one has got goes up at the
shoulder<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.180> bends<00:04:03.420> at<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.660> elbow<00:04:03.750> so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
shoulder and bends at the elbow so

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.160 
shoulder and bends at the elbow so
that's<00:04:04.380> quite<00:04:04.650> articulate<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.550> rotate<00:04:06.360> 360

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that's quite articulate and rotate 360

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.290 
that's quite articulate and rotate 360
degrees<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:08.190> put<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.430> pistol<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.090> urn

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
degrees you put the pistol in this urn

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.620 
degrees you put the pistol in this urn
and<00:04:12.560> then<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.710> arm<00:04:14.010> here's<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.430> gun<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:15.510> know

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
and then this arm here's a gun you know

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.810 
and then this arm here's a gun you know
you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.870> hold<00:04:16.020> it<00:04:16.170> up<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:18.650> like<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.040> but<00:04:20.640> also

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
you can hold it up like like so but also

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.640 
you can hold it up like like so but also
if<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.359> rotate<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:22.340> around<00:04:23.510> like<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.780> flip

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
if you rotate it around like that flip

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.080 
if you rotate it around like that flip
this<00:04:25.830> thing<00:04:25.890> around

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
this thing around

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.620 
this thing around
and<00:04:28.090> it's<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.350> little<00:04:29.560> bit

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
and it's and then this little bit

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.610 
and it's and then this little bit
renting<00:04:31.630> here<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:34.440> let's<00:04:35.440> go<00:04:35.590> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
renting here you just let's go a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.530 
renting here you just let's go a
spin<00:04:36.070> in<00:04:36.100> chop<00:04:36.580> weapon<00:04:37.030> thing<00:04:37.300> which<00:04:37.510> is

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
spin in chop weapon thing which is

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.980 
spin in chop weapon thing which is
pretty<00:04:37.900> cool<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:39.430> anyway<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.300> that's<00:04:40.690> really

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
pretty cool but anyway so that's really

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.900 
pretty cool but anyway so that's really
it<00:04:41.140> good<00:04:41.770> light<00:04:41.950> pipe<00:04:42.220> in<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.640> see<00:04:42.820> it

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
it good light pipe in you can see it

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.120 
it good light pipe in you can see it
glowing<00:04:43.150> just<00:04:43.720> slightly<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:47.380> know<00:04:47.530> my<00:04:47.920> hand
