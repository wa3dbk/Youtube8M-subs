hear that's meant to be i think i think

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.980 
hear that's meant to be i think i think
it's<00:05:12.310> meant<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.520> be<00:05:12.580> four<00:05:13.330> centimeters<00:05:13.960> of

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
it's meant to be four centimeters of

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
adjustment on each side so yeah very

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.110 
adjustment on each side so yeah very
simple<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.650> then<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:20.889> get<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.280> this<00:05:21.700> part<00:05:21.940> here

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
simple and then we get to this part here

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.839 
simple and then we get to this part here
which<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.690> volume<00:05:23.380> control<00:05:23.770> really<00:05:24.460> smart

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
which is the volume control really smart

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.560 
which is the volume control really smart
so<00:05:25.780> that's<00:05:25.930> how<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.080> control<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:26.470> volume

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
so that's how you control the volume

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.629 
so that's how you control the volume
that's<00:05:28.570> volume<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.710> volume<00:05:30.099> down<00:05:30.310> and

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.400 
that's volume that's volume down and
that<00:05:31.210> weighs<00:05:31.360> volume<00:05:31.690> up<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.200> very

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
that weighs volume up this is very

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.980 
that weighs volume up this is very
simple<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:35.470> yeah<00:05:35.639> that's<00:05:36.639> as<00:05:36.910> again<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.750> top

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990
