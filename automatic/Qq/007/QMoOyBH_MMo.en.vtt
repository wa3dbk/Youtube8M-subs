00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.160
 Thursday and girls well we are here in a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.980
 tutorial 6 and 6 2 we no longer go to the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.179
 tutorials on how to upload the fps of the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.910
 minecraft to the maximum exponent the to 1.86 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.199
 and if in this version the fps gets a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.760
 high you do not see 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:26.460
 good here from ibias 70 69 fps 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.910
 and well 54-51 I'm changing witnesses 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.830
 the sheets the graphics more or less there 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.960
 throwing themselves up more or less in the middle and 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.540
 all that the world this newly created and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.450
 there is still something missing to load or that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.280
 always bullets and predicates have tps 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.190
 but I've put this on a bit more 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 higher than normal to teach the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.870
 show that if the fps goes up 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.420
 because here I go that 25 to 55 and I do not know what 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.339
 I do not know how much less we stop here in 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.500
 First of all, this is going to be removed 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.750
 Exhaust dung options settings 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 video 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 and we start with the rendering myself 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.690
 I recommend for the four unx or two 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 already as you want and recommended 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.050
 for the votes that can play you better 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 that with two chung the truth is not much 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.710
 difference between 25 and 45 so I would 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.400
 would leave in 482 fast graphs for 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.520
 media charge of the option something that is 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.369
 soft lighting no more or less pps without 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.800
 limit balance already to busts and that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 leave them and if you do not want to leave it by the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.850
 salt or 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 otherwise I do not recommend touching them 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.100
 normal interface and clear 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.030
 minimal minimum particle clouds 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.070
 until complete is everything I do not recommend 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.890
 putting it does not help does not help anything so 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.990
 do not put it the various already 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 I recommend lowering it to a minimum or 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:02.250
 zero and use v &amp; v os that what helps you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.619
 the graph some of that is like that and this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.429
 it gives since not and now already done and you go to 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:14.420
 see the incredible fps change 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.370
 here you see 198 199 669 212 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.610
 and the change that minecraft has hit 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.530
 nothing changes fits and it is and we 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.450
 difference this can be done if the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.160
 lost and find and when you have the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.989
 chifas I do not even tell you how much was it 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.330
 go to go here a motorcycle passed 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.010
 for now my house but well this 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.890
 it has been all she knows that the tutorial 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.209
 easy enough, you can climb the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.489
 sometimes the main clip or playing 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.519
 quiet look at vices that come like this 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.440
 mainka that distance deschamps the truth 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.140
 you hardly notice anything because of that for 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.300
 play they gave everything gameplay and it's 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.069
 quite well this distance from his I 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.780
 I highly recommend it and if any of you 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.819
 wrong with this distance that you put two 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.549
 chung and that he also plans to put three 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.019
 already at your choice so nothing I 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.090
 dismissal here live orbited subscribe 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.090
