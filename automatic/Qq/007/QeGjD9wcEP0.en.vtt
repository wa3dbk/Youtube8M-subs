00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.019
 hello to all and all these killers 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.390
 for a new oft class video 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.460
 I hope you have 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.610
 great because today 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.470
 you present the video tips hendrix 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.230
 so suntree guys what what 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.020
 that's all my stuff and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.790
 so tricks on the place that the shoklan 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.310
 who may be able to help you 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.160
 or you do not know them 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.230
 already in any case I hope it's okay 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.560
 please go without delay 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.470
 start with the first tip so the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.120
 first tip will consist in preparing 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.149
 his troops in advance indeed you 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.649
 can make giants for example your 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.739
 big troupe who take a lot of 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.239
 place so your customers know so 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.699
 that your troops are ready before or 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.589
 do like me archers and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.989
 goblins just before going into battle 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.179
 because the troops are going to be going 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.969
 consider empty when you will be 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.750
 attacker when you attack so 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.550
 is you then you as it lands 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 will fill up you can see that in 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.930
 returning from combat I already have 50 troop 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 therefore ready for something near the 64 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.280
 which is really very practical second 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.579
 hints so this one always for the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.350
 troops going to constitute will consist of 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.299
 very precisely organize your 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 troop formation what are you going 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.070
 do is you're going to do a 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.850
 calculation with respect to your army as well 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.310
 than what you use and and do 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.320
 exactly the same number of troops 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.210
 for each barracks example if because 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.030
 for example if you take a barracks 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.890
 for the barracks for the giants a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.619
 fortnight for the goblins a barracks 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 for other things finally it'll be 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.140
 say take disproportionate and that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.939
 will be poorly organized since your 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.259
 troops are not going to be ready at the same 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.990
 time because there will be some who will take 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.240
 much more time I advise you 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 to do that in combination by combining the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.880
 two tricks on the troops I 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.090
 just give you you can 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.830
 reduce by one third or even the mesh the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.180
 half the time of your training 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 troops because if you already arrive at a 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.330
 quarter of your troops ready 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 as well as one as well as a command 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.650
 to an optimization of the formation of 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.319
 your route you will be very successful 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.950
 and the time will be diminished consider is 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.250
 considerably now a little 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.569
 trick on broken brick is enough 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.010
 strange but a lot of people 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.329
 think that breakage bricks do not 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.180
 destroy a wall 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.680
 indeed the breaks brick destroy 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.329
 two walls they do damage from 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.549
 area as you can see from 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.849
 breakout since a brick breaker 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.829
 do not destroy a wall of those of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.500
 level 8 in one shot I put two the 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.620
 dga john did that these two breaks 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.359
 bricks destroyed both walls 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.099
 so now I'm going to talk to you about 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.310
 something pretty interesting it's going 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.489
 be 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.790
 how to say a placement of your 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.010
 money 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.359
 so you're going to go into decoration and 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.799
 all these things that you think they 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.269
 do not serve anything in fact you you 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 serve since when you go 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.359
 buy a decoration and then after 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.519
 you are going to sell it you will be able to 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.709
 sell it at 10% of its price which is 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.599
 miserable but believe me we come 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.970
 always at some point in clash of clan 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.799
 where we have too much money 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.200
 for example when you go before 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.530
 spend an hdv you go for example 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.359
 to be mad at or even at a time of a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.010
 moment of the game so you shake some 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.449
 flags for example the statue of pk or 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.720
 the old skull if you have to 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.169
 money 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 and when you will miss 30000 to 40000 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:48.549
 10000 gold you will be very happy 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.510
 to be able to sell his decorations 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 next so now I'm going to you 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.069
 learn how to better use your traps 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.720
 so there you can see I did it quickly 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.069
 does an organization request a 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.629
 typical village 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.370
 so that's the person who will 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.729
 deploy giants how she goes there 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.470
 take 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.659
 well she will try with these breaks 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.810
 bricks trying to make a maximum of 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.280
 damage so of 2 type 2 type in them 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.900
 crossovers and so destroy the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.989
 two crossovers so what are you going 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.510
 do is you're going to put your 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.919
 spring traps stack in the corners where 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.820
 they are going to want to put the traps to 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:29.090
 spring and so be able to blow up to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.130
 sure one at least breakage bricks 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.780
 and I can tell you that 1 or breakage 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.440
 bricks in less in an attack that 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.380
 make the difference 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.240
 you can also put in the corners 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.130
 because often by these corners there people 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.000
 people are attacking by it's been 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.160
 very often 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.900
 get attacked by share so a 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.210
 strategy that happens so diagonally 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.410
 and which he I advise you to 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.040
 two meters in the corners and the 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.910
 intersections 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.870
 which is really powerful 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.610
 now we're going for bombs 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.590
 so for the good ones how to use them 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.590
 at best the best is to use them 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.820
 near your gold reserves and elections 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.310
 because that's because the units that go 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.190
 succeed in melee to access the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.530
 melee of its reserves are going to be 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.290
 units very very vulnerable to these 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.060
 bombs now I'm going to teach you 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.440
 to place the bombs in front of your 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.780
 city ​​hall what are you going to do 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.150
 it's putting a bomb diagonally stack 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.520
 front like that when the archers and 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.250
 for example where barbarians will arrive 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.110
 they will be exploded and projected on the 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.669
 side they will be projected on the side 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.650
 on the other bomb 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.720
 the other bomb that will explode that was worth 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.600
 project a little bit backwards 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.419
 and who will arrive so on the other 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.760
 bomb is so the center bomb goes 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.020
 project on both sides on both 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.720
 other bombs that will explode 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.169
 you do not need to spend 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.790
 more gloves you have an optimization 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.560
 perfect of your bombs in front of your 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.530
 city ​​hall you add and some 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.990
 tesla and that's perfect now 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.970
 a last tip that will consist of 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.510
 very quickly 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.040
 the elixir around sorbets so 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.630
 imagine that you are stuck around 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.990
 sorbet because you can not manage them 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.419
 attacking well I'll advise you 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.850
 you're going to start and so has it 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.310
 archers but in fact so you 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.890
 first destroy the traps and then 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.280
 you're going to alternate the agro so the big one 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.560
 and the ability of that an enemy to to 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.660
 so you attack here the mortar that goes 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.729
 shoot on it and you're going to alternate 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.110
 between the archers so there you can 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.000
 see I have an archer who gets destroyed 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.220
 by a mortar 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.650
 next and that's the other archers who will 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.510
 take over and so little by little 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.760
 with quite a bit of mess and in the end you 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.440
 will succeed in stealing all the elixir so 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.030
 there I have zero on zero since I already 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.210
 any price in this village 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.360
 but believe me when you arrive 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.849
 at the sorbets turn the pro 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.550
 the first time and that links to 800 miles 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:03.360
 on the reserves and that as soon as you 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:06.210
 quit this fight well that would be 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.009
 his stage serie so the elixir returns to 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.990
 25% in each reserve 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.879
 you have only years chained his 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.800
 until there are only 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:16.110
 the city hall is an equivalent of to 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.659
 about 50 thousand or a hundred thousand elixir 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.979
 but hey we're going to say 7,700 miles of 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.319
 profits is already huge 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.539
 here is I hope this video has you 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.060
 please do not hesitate to put a gem if 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:29.009
 this is the case for commenting on the 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.289
 to share with your friends your family everything 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.599
 what you know who played clash of 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:36.270
 man and who are addicts of this game 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.250
 like me here's what I'm going to 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.740
 wish a good continuation I do not 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.599
 I will not go you 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.639
 bother for a long time go hi a 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.360
 all that was pretty slash at the next 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.360
 banana
