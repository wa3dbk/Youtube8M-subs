how do you what's up it to be thorne and
we<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.050> my<00:01:34.110> studio<00:01:34.410> today<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> look

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
we are here in my studio today to look

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.160 
we are here in my studio today to look
at<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.190> Atomic<00:01:35.580> CLR<00:01:36.150> full<00:01:36.540> range<00:01:36.810> flat

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
at the Atomic CLR full range flat

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.470 
at the Atomic CLR full range flat
response<00:01:37.380> speaker<00:01:37.950> cabinet<00:01:38.450> there's<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
response speaker cabinet there's a

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.790 
response speaker cabinet there's a
couple<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> inversions<00:01:40.170> these<00:01:40.350> cabinets

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
couple of inversions these cabinets

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.770 
couple of inversions these cabinets
available<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.730> in<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.270> wedge

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
available you can get them in a wedge

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
available you can get them in a wedge
which<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.290> I've<00:01:43.380> got<00:01:43.530> sitting<00:01:43.770> right

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
which is what I've got sitting right

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
which is what I've got sitting right
here<00:01:43.920> obviously<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.150> cube<00:01:45.450> style

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
here obviously or in a cube style

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.360 
here obviously or in a cube style
cabinet<00:01:46.230> so<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> square<00:01:46.980> back

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
cabinet so it's more like a square back

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.690 
cabinet so it's more like a square back
line<00:01:47.670> style<00:01:48.000> cabinet<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:50.190> can<00:01:50.340> also<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.580> them

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
line style cabinet you can also get them

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.000 
line style cabinet you can also get them
in<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.850> passive<00:01:51.630> version<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.800> use<00:01:52.979> your

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
in a passive version so you can use your

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.490 
in a passive version so you can use your
own<00:01:53.190> power<00:01:53.400> amp<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:53.910> if<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.500> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
own power amp with it if you want this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.580 
own power amp with it if you want this
one<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:56.400> active<00:01:57.050> 500<00:01:58.050> watt<00:01:58.229> by

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
one I have here is an active 500 watt by

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770 
one I have here is an active 500 watt by
amped<00:01:58.950> version<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.760> it's<00:02:00.180> got<00:02:00.300> its<00:02:00.420> own<00:02:00.479> power

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
amped version so it's got its own power

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.120 
amped version so it's got its own power
amplification<00:02:01.170> built<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.009> we're<00:02:02.100> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
amplification built in so we're just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.380 
amplification built in so we're just
going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> deal<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> powered<00:02:03.150> wedge

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
going to deal with the powered wedge

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.570 
going to deal with the powered wedge
version<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.080> today<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.680> review<00:02:04.979> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the goal with the atomic CLR series caps

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.630 
the goal with the atomic CLR series caps
was<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> produce<00:02:07.800> an<00:02:07.979> extremely<00:02:08.459> accurate

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
was to produce an extremely accurate

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.030 
was to produce an extremely accurate
full<00:02:09.119> range<00:02:09.360> flat<00:02:09.630> response<00:02:09.840> monitor<00:02:10.619> system

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
full range flat response monitor system

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.430 
full range flat response monitor system
with<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.580> end<00:02:11.730> user<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.660> mind<00:02:12.930> being<00:02:13.260> the

or<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> Kemper<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> line<00:02:18.360> 6<00:02:18.660> pod<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:19.410> even<00:02:19.740> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
or a Kemper or a line 6 pod or even a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
or a Kemper or a line 6 pod or even a
head<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.910> run<00:02:21.090> into<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.450> load<00:02:21.750> box<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
head that you run into a load box and a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
head that you run into a load box and a
speaker<00:02:22.590> simulator<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.910> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
speaker simulator and now you want to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.750 
speaker simulator and now you want to
send<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> signal<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:25.260> through<00:02:25.920> accurate

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
send that signal out through accurate

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.400 
send that signal out through accurate
monitoring<00:02:27.209> system<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.780> let's<00:02:28.170> say<00:02:28.260> you've

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
monitoring system and let's say you've

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.930 
monitoring system and let's say you've
tweaked<00:02:28.650> your<00:02:28.709> presets<00:02:29.160> at<00:02:29.310> home<00:02:29.520> using

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

is a really really hard thing to try and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.740 
is a really really hard thing to try and
reproduce<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.640> demo<00:02:47.970> video<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.450> let's<00:02:48.600> not

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
reproduce in a demo video so let's not

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.479 
reproduce in a demo video so let's not
call<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> demo<00:02:49.920> I'm<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> call<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.459> a

of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> cabinet<00:04:27.419> changes<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> little<00:04:27.990> bit<00:04:28.140> well

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
of the cabinet changes a little bit well

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.290 
of the cabinet changes a little bit well
the<00:04:28.800> guys<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:29.070> atonic<00:04:29.520> have<00:04:29.640> compensated

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
the guys that atonic have compensated

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.600 
the guys that atonic have compensated
for<00:04:30.419> this<00:04:30.570> using<00:04:31.200> DSP<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:31.950> if<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.130> look<00:04:32.340> at<00:04:32.490> the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
for this using DSP so if we look at the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.750 
for this using DSP so if we look at the
back<00:04:32.760> panel<00:04:33.770> you've<00:04:34.770> got<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.160> three<00:04:35.490> position

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760

preset switch first position says F F
okay<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.300> stands<00:04:39.510> for<00:04:39.690> free<00:04:39.900> field<00:04:40.110> that's

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
okay that stands for free field that's

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.680 
okay that stands for free field that's
when<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.560> use<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.800> up<00:04:40.890> on<00:04:41.040> stands<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.510> next

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
when you use it up on stands the next

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.150 
when you use it up on stands the next
position<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.110> tilt<00:04:43.440> that's<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:43.860> you're<00:04:43.979> using

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
position is tilt that's if you're using

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.520 
position is tilt that's if you're using
the<00:04:44.430> cabinet<00:04:44.820> as<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> floor<00:04:45.479> wedge<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.320> next

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the cabinet as a floor wedge the next

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.530 
the cabinet as a floor wedge the next
position<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:47.010> BL<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.610> stands<00:04:47.850> for<00:04:47.910> back<00:04:48.240> line

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
position is BL that stands for back line

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.450 
position is BL that stands for back line
if<00:04:48.750> you're<00:04:48.870> using<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.620> guitar<00:04:49.830> cabinet

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
if you're using it like a guitar cabinet

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.180 
if you're using it like a guitar cabinet
behind<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.320> using<00:04:52.320> DSP<00:04:52.740> that's<00:04:53.010> which

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
behind you and using DSP that's which

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.480 
behind you and using DSP that's which
will<00:04:53.370> just<00:04:53.520> compensate<00:04:54.090> with<00:04:54.360> some<00:04:54.510> EQ<00:04:54.930> and

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
will just compensate with some EQ and

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.680 
will just compensate with some EQ and
it's<00:04:56.490> pretty<00:04:56.760> amazing<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.270> actually<00:04:57.570> the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
it's pretty amazing it actually the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.930 
it's pretty amazing it actually the
cabinet<00:04:58.080> sounds<00:04:58.440> basically<00:04:58.919> identical<00:04:59.490> as

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
cabinet sounds basically identical as

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.340 
cabinet sounds basically identical as
long<00:05:00.090> as<00:05:00.210> you've<00:05:00.330> got<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.510> switch<00:05:00.810> set<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
long as you've got the switch set in the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.630 
long as you've got the switch set in the
right<00:05:01.500> position<00:05:01.919> no<00:05:02.190> matter<00:05:02.400> how<00:05:02.580> you

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
right position no matter how you

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.969 
right position no matter how you
position<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.410> okay<00:05:04.410> let's<00:05:04.590> look<00:05:04.680> at<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.830> back

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
position it okay let's look at the back

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.380 
position it okay let's look at the back
panel<00:05:05.010> some<00:05:05.460> more<00:05:05.640> so<00:05:06.000> you've<00:05:06.090> got<00:05:06.210> two

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
panel some more so you've got two

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.060 
panel some more so you've got two
separate<00:05:06.720> inputs<00:05:07.050> input<00:05:07.350> one<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.560> two<00:05:07.800> each

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
separate inputs input one and two each

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.219 
separate inputs input one and two each
with<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> separate<00:05:08.729> level<00:05:08.910> control

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
with a separate level control

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.920 
with a separate level control
you've<00:05:10.650> got<00:05:10.860> XLR<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.790> quarter-inch<00:05:12.479> combo

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
you've got XLR and quarter-inch combo

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.180 
you've got XLR and quarter-inch combo
style<00:05:13.169> connectors<00:05:13.620> for<00:05:13.830> each<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.100> those

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
style connectors for each of those

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.430 
style connectors for each of those
inputs<00:05:14.640> and<00:05:14.940> they'll<00:05:15.720> accept<00:05:15.930> balanced<00:05:16.320> or

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
inputs and they'll accept balanced or

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.110 
inputs and they'll accept balanced or
unbalanced<00:05:16.860> signals<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.400> really<00:05:17.669> wide<00:05:17.850> range

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
unbalanced signals so really wide range

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.020 
unbalanced signals so really wide range
of<00:05:18.210> input<00:05:18.510> options<00:05:18.900> there<00:05:19.729> here's<00:05:20.729> why<00:05:20.880> it's

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
of input options there here's why it's

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.730 
of input options there here's why it's
great<00:05:21.270> having<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.690> two<00:05:21.840> inputs<00:05:22.229> here's<00:05:22.650> a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
great having the two inputs here's a

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.170 
great having the two inputs here's a
scenario<00:05:22.919> for<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.729> could<00:05:23.850> plug<00:05:24.030> your

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
scenario for you you could plug your

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.690 
scenario for you you could plug your
modelling<00:05:24.600> processor<00:05:25.200> into<00:05:25.740> input<00:05:26.220> one<00:05:26.490> and

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
modelling processor into input one and

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.719 
modelling processor into input one and
have<00:05:27.150> your<00:05:27.300> guitar<00:05:27.570> signal<00:05:27.810> there<00:05:28.250> on<00:05:29.250> input

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
have your guitar signal there on input

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.190 
have your guitar signal there on input
two<00:05:29.970> let's<00:05:30.330> say<00:05:30.419> you're<00:05:30.539> playing<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.810> gig<00:05:30.990> where

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
two let's say you're playing a gig where

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.420 
two let's say you're playing a gig where
there's<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.410> monitor<00:05:31.770> desk<00:05:31.979> well<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.280> could

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
there's a monitor desk well you could

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.310 
there's a monitor desk well you could
get<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.580> feed<00:05:32.880> from<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.180> monitor<00:05:33.630> desk<00:05:33.840> plug<00:05:34.229> it

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
get a feed from the monitor desk plug it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.290 
get a feed from the monitor desk plug it
into<00:05:34.470> input<00:05:34.800> two<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.340> have<00:05:35.640> your<00:05:35.760> drums<00:05:36.060> and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
into input two and have your drums and

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.330 
into input two and have your drums and
vocals<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.780> things<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.200> there<00:05:37.950> with<00:05:38.310> a

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
vocals and things like that there with a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.130 
vocals and things like that there with a
separate<00:05:38.760> level<00:05:38.910> control<00:05:39.390> so<00:05:39.780> now<00:05:39.900> you've<00:05:40.020> got

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
separate level control so now you've got

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.690 
separate level control so now you've got
the<00:05:40.229> independent<00:05:40.770> control<00:05:40.979> in<00:05:41.250> your<00:05:41.370> wedge<00:05:41.520> of

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
the independent control in your wedge of

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.159 
the independent control in your wedge of
your<00:05:41.820> guitar<00:05:42.120> volume<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.810> mix

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
your guitar volume and the mix

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.749 
your guitar volume and the mix
the<00:05:43.259> rest<00:05:43.469> of<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.680> band<00:05:43.860> that's<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.550> really

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
up you've got the master volume control

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.089 
up you've got the master volume control
that's<00:05:51.659> just<00:05:51.810> master<00:05:52.169> overall<00:05:52.529> level<00:05:52.860> for<00:05:53.039> the

by switching in that sub filter last
step<00:06:07.590> you<00:06:07.620> get<00:06:07.770> the<00:06:07.919> link<00:06:08.129> connector<00:06:08.610> it's<00:06:08.819> an

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
step you get the link connector it's an

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.689 
step you get the link connector it's an
XLR<00:06:09.330> style<00:06:09.719> jack<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.349> what<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.249> is<00:06:11.400> is<00:06:11.550> just

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
XLR style jack and what that is is just

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.249 
XLR style jack and what that is is just
a<00:06:11.939> feed<00:06:12.180> through<00:06:12.419> so<00:06:12.629> whatever<00:06:12.900> is<00:06:12.960> coming<00:06:13.139> in

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 
input 1 input 2 or both you can send out

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.739 
input 1 input 2 or both you can send out
to<00:06:16.499> say<00:06:16.979> front<00:06:17.279> of<00:06:17.339> house<00:06:17.460> or<00:06:17.699> the<00:06:17.819> monitors<00:06:18.240> so

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:18.749 
to say front of house or the monitors so

to say front of house or the monitors so
in<00:06:18.839> my<00:06:18.960> previous<00:06:19.259> scenario<00:06:19.770> I<00:06:19.800> was<00:06:20.009> mentioning

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
in my previous scenario I was mentioning

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.890 
in my previous scenario I was mentioning
where<00:06:20.550> you'd<00:06:20.669> have<00:06:20.699> your<00:06:20.969> modeling<00:06:21.360> processor

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
where you'd have your modeling processor

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.719 
where you'd have your modeling processor
in<00:06:21.990> input<00:06:22.229> 1<00:06:22.529> and<00:06:22.740> then<00:06:23.129> a<00:06:23.159> mix<00:06:23.460> from<00:06:23.580> the

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
in input 1 and then a mix from the

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.339 
in input 1 and then a mix from the
monitor<00:06:24.089> desk<00:06:24.330> coming<00:06:24.629> into<00:06:24.749> input<00:06:25.139> 2

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
monitor desk coming into input 2

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.140 
monitor desk coming into input 2
obviously<00:06:25.889> you'd<00:06:26.069> only<00:06:26.189> want<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.520> send<00:06:26.699> input

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
obviously you'd only want to send input

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.529 
obviously you'd only want to send input
1<00:06:27.449> out<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:28.889> monitors<00:06:29.310> into<00:06:29.520> front<00:06:30.479> of

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
1 out to the monitors into front of

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.909 
1 out to the monitors into front of
house<00:06:30.689> so<00:06:30.930> that's<00:06:31.050> easy<00:06:31.259> to<00:06:31.469> do<00:06:31.589> with<00:06:31.800> the

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
house so that's easy to do with the

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.860 
house so that's easy to do with the
switch<00:06:32.189> here<00:06:32.430> just<00:06:32.699> either<00:06:32.849> in<00:06:33.089> position<00:06:33.659> 1

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
switch here just either in position 1

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.020 
switch here just either in position 1
position<00:06:33.900> 2<00:06:34.589> or<00:06:34.889> blended

wish<00:06:42.780> there<00:06:42.990> could<00:06:43.080> be<00:06:43.110> more<00:06:43.350> music<00:06:43.740> in<00:06:43.890> it<00:06:44.010> I

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
wish there could be more music in it I

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800 
wish there could be more music in it I
think<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.820> only<00:06:44.850> way<00:06:45.150> to<00:06:45.210> really<00:06:45.420> experience

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
think the only way to really experience

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.120 
think the only way to really experience
these<00:06:46.050> speakers<00:06:46.410> though<00:06:46.560> on<00:06:46.650> how<00:06:46.710> good<00:06:46.980> they

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
these speakers though on how good they

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.610 
these speakers though on how good they
sound<00:06:47.340> is<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.670> get<00:06:47.820> in<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:48.000> room<00:06:48.150> with<00:06:48.210> them<00:06:48.620> one

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
sound is to get in a room with them one

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.810 
sound is to get in a room with them one
of<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:49.800> things<00:06:49.980> I<00:06:50.070> did<00:06:50.250> when<00:06:50.370> I<00:06:50.430> was<00:06:50.550> initially

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
of the things I did when I was initially

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.240 
of the things I did when I was initially
testing<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.480> is<00:06:51.630> run<00:06:52.170> some<00:06:52.440> songs<00:06:52.710> out<00:06:52.980> through

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
testing it is run some songs out through

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.580 
testing it is run some songs out through
it<00:06:53.340> just<00:06:53.490> from<00:06:53.610> iTunes<00:06:54.000> and<00:06:54.500> you<00:06:55.500> know

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
it just from iTunes and you know

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.660 
it just from iTunes and you know
listening<00:06:56.040> to<00:06:56.100> it<00:06:56.250> just<00:06:56.430> for<00:06:56.580> music

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
listening to it just for music

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.400 
listening to it just for music
reproduction<00:06:57.390> I<00:06:57.450> was<00:06:57.540> just<00:06:57.690> blown<00:06:57.960> away<00:06:58.140> with

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
reproduction I was just blown away with

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.140 
reproduction I was just blown away with
how<00:06:58.590> good<00:06:58.740> they<00:06:58.920> sound<00:06:59.160> basically<00:06:59.610> what<00:06:59.940> goes

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
how good they sound basically what goes

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.850 
how good they sound basically what goes
in<00:07:00.360> is<00:07:00.570> what<00:07:00.870> comes<00:07:01.080> out<00:07:01.290> that's<00:07:01.440> what<00:07:01.620> I<00:07:01.680> want

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
in is what comes out that's what I want

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.280 
in is what comes out that's what I want
to<00:07:01.920> get<00:07:02.040> across<00:07:02.220> in<00:07:02.520> this<00:07:02.550> video<00:07:03.200> you<00:07:04.200> know

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
to get across in this video you know

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.020 
to get across in this video you know
with<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.500> advent<00:07:04.890> of<00:07:04.980> modeling<00:07:05.490> getting<00:07:05.760> so

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
with the advent of modeling getting so

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.850 
with the advent of modeling getting so
good<00:07:06.240> guitar<00:07:06.630> modeling<00:07:07.050> processors<00:07:07.650> and

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
good guitar modeling processors and

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.100 
good guitar modeling processors and
speaker<00:07:08.490> simulation<00:07:09.060> and<00:07:09.300> also<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.840> trend

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
speaker simulation and also the trend

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.140 
speaker simulation and also the trend
towards<00:07:10.440> quieter<00:07:10.950> stages<00:07:11.460> and<00:07:11.700> bringing<00:07:11.940> less

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
towards quieter stages and bringing less

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.120 
towards quieter stages and bringing less
stuff<00:07:12.390> to<00:07:12.420> gigs<00:07:12.750> I<00:07:12.990> think<00:07:13.530> a<00:07:13.590> lot<00:07:13.770> of<00:07:13.860> guitar

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
stuff to gigs I think a lot of guitar

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.340 
stuff to gigs I think a lot of guitar
players<00:07:14.160> will<00:07:14.610> find<00:07:14.790> a<00:07:15.000> place<00:07:15.720> for<00:07:15.780> these<00:07:16.140> in

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
players will find a place for these in

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.230 
players will find a place for these in
the<00:07:16.440> rigs<00:07:16.710> so<00:07:17.040> so<00:07:17.370> be<00:07:17.730> sure<00:07:17.760> and<00:07:17.910> check<00:07:18.030> them

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
the rigs so so be sure and check them

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.730 
the rigs so so be sure and check them
out<00:07:18.330> I<00:07:18.390> think<00:07:18.660> they're<00:07:18.780> just<00:07:19.230> a<00:07:19.320> great<00:07:19.500> product

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
out I think they're just a great product

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:29.850 
out I think they're just a great product
