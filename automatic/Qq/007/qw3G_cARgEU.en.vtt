 Defensive there was a lot to do 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.170
 However , the jahn results last 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.290

 continue to run for the jahn 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.850

 Piper there was no ball in the net 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.110
 play clear emergency brake that gives eleven meters 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 for the year and the red card for 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 the goalkeeper marvin knoll enters and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.930
 that hits the 30th 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.890
 and that should not be the last eleven meters 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.590
 against augsburg his eleven meters all 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 bitterly forgive self-confidence 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.079
 reunited 400 Schweinfurt had to 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.829
 then also the fifth hit 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.879
 defense with before 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.670

 sealed 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.770
 never let it go until half- time 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.680
 have the opponent again and again 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.310
