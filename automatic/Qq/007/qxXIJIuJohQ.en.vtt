00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in platinum games I have creative

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.260 
in platinum games I have creative
freedom<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.100> usually<00:01:38.700> problem<00:01:39.090> games

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
freedom and usually problem games

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
freedom and usually problem games
especially<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.840> Bayonetta<00:01:40.290> 2<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.650> bed<00:01:40.799> neither

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
especially a Bayonetta 2 in bed neither

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.580 
especially a Bayonetta 2 in bed neither
one<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.210> sex<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.840> way<00:01:42.990> that's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
one was really about sex in a way that's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
one was really about sex in a way that's
why<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.890> definitely<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.399> large<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
why I was definitely a pretty large and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
why I was definitely a pretty large and
significant<00:01:45.570> theme<00:01:45.840> within<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
significant theme within the game so I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
significant theme within the game so I
guess<00:01:47.640> Nintendo<00:01:48.060> understood<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
guess Nintendo understood that and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.810 
guess Nintendo understood that and
instead<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> trying<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> portray<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.579> theme

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
instead of trying to portray the theme

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.340 
instead of trying to portray the theme
they<00:01:51.240> thought<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.840> should<00:01:52.049> make<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
they thought that they should make this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
they thought that they should make this
no<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:53.220> along<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.670> dream<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.240> theme<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
no go along with dream with the theme so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
no go along with dream with the theme so
I<00:01:54.780> give<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.170> good<00:01:55.320> nintendo<00:01:55.680> credit<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.189> really
