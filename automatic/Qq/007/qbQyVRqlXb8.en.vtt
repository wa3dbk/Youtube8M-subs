00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
relatively quickly I didn't think was

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
relatively quickly I didn't think was
very<00:00:21.480> hard<00:00:21.689> wrote<00:00:22.080> duel<00:00:22.529> style<00:00:22.830> took<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> little

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
very hard wrote duel style took a little

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.519 
very hard wrote duel style took a little
while<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.050> challenging<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
while it was a little challenging I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
while it was a little challenging I
guess<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:26.130> times<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:26.970> tough<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
guess at times you know it was tough to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509 
guess at times you know it was tough to
get<00:00:27.359> 90<00:00:27.840> 90<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.260> chemistry's<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.160> whatever<00:00:29.369> our

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
get 90 90 on chemistry's or whatever our

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
get 90 90 on chemistry's or whatever our
styles<00:00:29.880> i<00:00:30.029> guess<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.810> overall<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.320> too

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
styles i guess but overall not too

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
styles i guess but overall not too
difficult<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.279> complete<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.640> set<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
difficult to complete this set you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.360 
difficult to complete this set you
really<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:33.960> need<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.410> 500,000<00:00:35.280> coins

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
really just need you know 500,000 coins

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
really just need you know 500,000 coins
probably<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> need<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably is about what you need to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
probably is about what you need to
complete<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.070> this

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
complete this and you get this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just crazy for a safety not really sure

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.190 
just crazy for a safety not really sure
if<00:01:08.760> I'd<00:01:08.880> ever<00:01:08.909> put<00:01:09.299> him<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> man<00:01:09.659> coverage<00:01:09.869> but

zone coverage is ridiculous 88 pursuit
is<00:01:15.570> crazy<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> 90<00:01:17.280> hit<00:01:17.430> power

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is crazy good and then the 90 hit power
