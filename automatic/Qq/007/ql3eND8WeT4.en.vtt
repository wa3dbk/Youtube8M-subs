00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
middle of the first loop so i will go to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.360

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
climb and you know the wing was really

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.510 
climb and you know the wing was really
harsh<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.940> was<00:01:42.930> only<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.710> wings<00:01:43.980> started<00:01:44.430> from

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
harsh it was only had wings started from

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
harsh it was only had wings started from
swim<00:01:44.880> start<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:46.170> flat<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.710> also

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
swim start and it's so flat here also

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
swim start and it's so flat here also
you<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> find<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.380> wind<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.360> i

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you have to find you have the wind and i

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530 
you have to find you have the wind and i
think<00:01:52.230> it's<00:01:52.410> going<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
think it's going to be really have to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.070 
think it's going to be really have to
read<00:01:54.690> smart<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.980> don't<00:01:56.570> over<00:01:57.570> push<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
read smart and you don't over push it in

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.910 
read smart and you don't over push it in
the<00:01:58.140> first<00:01:58.410> lap<00:01:58.650> because<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> Durant's<00:02:01.710> will

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.250 
the first lap because the Durant's will
be<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.250> hard<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.820> even<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.479> me<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> strong
