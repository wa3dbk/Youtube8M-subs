00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello to all of you and arsenic 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.069
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.359
 so find today for the sneak 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 peek there who just dropped 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.490
 I'm in the company of nick 69 hi 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello cuckoo a sonic and hello to all 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.509
 So that's what you can tell us 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 a little bit what you think of that so 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 there you see on the screen there the image of the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
 new black troupe that will go out so 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 go ahead dino a little nick what are you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 in thought explains a little bit to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.960
 listeners what that 's going to consist of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 how what use goes to hell 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.620
 in fact this troop with pleasure to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.880
 listen to the guys this is the dog of the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.120
 rolls of the cow that means it's 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 a low domestic dog that will shit 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 to actually use that word when I 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 take it to the translation 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.300
 it is a domestic dog used for 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.770
 the hunt 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.340
 so basically not this unit will you 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.020
 allow to attack the anti towers 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 nearest airways so basically 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.039
 this is the pig boom except that you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.180
 know that pigs are used to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.989
 attack all the weapons of defense 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 while there the dogs of the good avs 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.570
 we really tackle only around 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.860
 whole so that's really it can be 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 really great if you want to play 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 dragon or balance r it's really 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.310
 awesome now awesome yeah me too 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 I think it's nice I think it's great 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 interesting actually there we see 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.259
 although they have a priority over 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 anti - aircraft defenses so the strategy 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.610
 really goes completely and modify 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.119
 for all those who use troops 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.490
 air 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.659
 we will have to make a mix finally I know 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 not going to have to test a little bit 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.900
 how is it going in my opinion there he 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.189
 not precise but I think with the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 new barracks they have 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 announced here will only be for 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.759
 warheads and say I think you pass 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 think like me to the cynics and we have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 an info as exclusive of the forum as 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.869
 what archived tours will go to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.159
 level 13 also so that's okay I'm 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.210
 a little mixed on it because me 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.040
 I did not go to the level yet 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 maximum to a level that we already know that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.340
 it was super expensive I think it's 7 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.380
 millions 500 thousand archers 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 which will rank 8 million knowing that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 still has 6 good rebounds that's true 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 that it will still be expensive 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.459
 but still good news 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.390
 defensive building improvements and there 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.050
 I am 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.520
 by the way on the twitter of clash of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.090
 clan and I see they put a video 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.310
 so yeah so yes actually so 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.840
 chief suffers there he posted a video with 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.760
 the troop I do not know if you will 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.610
 connect a nick on the twitter as 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 that we look at it together is on the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.220
 clash twitter to clans like that you 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 will tell me a little bit about what you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.650
 think 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.870
 so actually him in preview 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.489
 we know all the youtuber the big 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 youtuber as chief no godson they 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.420
 have they have ipad 2 developers in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.340
 general so they can test the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.070
 troops before and there we can see we're going 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 look together with nick you tell me to 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.090
 a guy when you're on the video is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.769
 so we'll announce it on twitter 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.350
 twitter clash twitter clash 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.750
 of clan really expected there as soon as you 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:05.459
 throw the video you tell me go for it like 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:16.739
 I'm going to put it roughly 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:18.000
 outright like that or who can we 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:27.690
 do a bit of translation at the same time 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.860
 that's in any case they have a good shot a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.140
 beautiful design and it really looks 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.140
 to help obese cute cro 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.700
 yeah we see well and there he really 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.489
 an action priority on defenses 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.720
 antiaircraft actually it you 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.980
 see it immediately went it 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.840
 not even go on the exit tower to 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.459
 nice on the tesla agrees and when 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.329
 it's destroyed it turns into full 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:55.799
 cute little cute girls in 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:58.530
 but a lot of life here are the villages that 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:06.560
 attack him it's huge 1 928 1871 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.560
 town it does very little damage but 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.269
 you see it's his priority so you 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.739
 see the arrows that mark that mark 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.330
 although the troop's priority was 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.889
 first the anti - aircraft defenses then 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.919
 the defenses and the other buildings 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.299
 French non defensive 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.380
 you see there with balloons it's going 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.000
 be very interesting to use them 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.900
 since it's still going to weaken but 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.250
 I have the impression that he does not 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.669
 a lot of damage I do not know what you 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.229
 in thoughts but after I do not know 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.550
 if there will be several levels and we see 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.470
 well by cons it is destroyed 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.389
 yeah when he is when he is destroyed 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:55.949
 its shape like a wave of little 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:57.620
 cute gold color a little I think that 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.870
 even for you who use the 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.039
 was waiting for them there was a little problem 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.690
 with nick 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.030
 it's normal it's live we're going 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.030
 try to get them back on 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.580
 happy no no problem there is no 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.050
 no problem I said it was 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
 it was really great because it's 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.530
 it takes a lot of damage it's a 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.760
 kind of flying golem yeah so that's 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.590
 true that even you do not use a lot 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.390
 the balloons if he goes maybe 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.490
 to be able to propose pots of leases 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:43.860
 early gameplay with that apparently it 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.390
 ironically he already has them at level 3 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.830
 apparently so but I have the impression 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.060
 that even at level 3 it does not 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.200
 a lot of damage so a golem 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.550
 yeah that's right, but that's it 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.110
 still weakens considerably 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.940
 anti-aircraft defenses 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.230
 I think the mac defenses it can be 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.330
 interesting you see with good 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.370
 servant balloon association especially 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.990
 when he when he dies when this 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.050
 troop mores to come on come as we said 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.760
 sacred to that generates other small 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.750
 cute will say gold color there we go 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.310
 have to see a little bit of that 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.450
 give but I think it's not bad 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.310
 huh no it's frankly I only have 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.700
 the update goes out i'll do some 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.830
 gameplay on it here for info in 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.540
 any case today so news 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.560
 black troops that will be available as 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.270
 it was said in hd v10 so for now 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.490
 we did not buy 10 for now 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.990
 does not have much info at na level 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.530
 not at all even about what he 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.480
 did not show the life that life and 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.010
 tps the damage per second 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.780
 I'm giving you how many places to 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.030
 take it that's it and for now 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.010
 we know we only know that there is 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.200
 three levels since we saw level 3 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.940
 by active paste and so what do we 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.740
 could you tell otherwise about saab a 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.900
 only the going too many level archers 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.090
 And I did not speak to you yesterday. 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.980
 of the other two updates but hey 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.020
 it's noticeable that because 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.320
 it was the black barracks of 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.660
 level 6 announcing this troop so 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.980
 the lava india and then they announced 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.310
 already everyone thought it was 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.620
 a golem if that yesterday but in the end so 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.270
 it was good it was the eyes 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.840
 eyes and the face of this of this 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.930
