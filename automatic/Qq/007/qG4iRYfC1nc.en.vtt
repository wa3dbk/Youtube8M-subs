durum wheat semolina flour and water so
no<00:00:16.379> eggs<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.890> pasta<00:00:17.310> we've<00:00:18.210> made<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> into

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
no eggs in this pasta we've made it into

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.750 
no eggs in this pasta we've made it into
a<00:00:19.320> dough<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.650> rolled<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> we've<00:00:20.189> let<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> stand

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a dough we rolled it we've let it stand

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.550 
a dough we rolled it we've let it stand
for<00:00:21.060> 5<00:00:21.270> minutes<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.380> going

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
for 5 minutes and now we're just going

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
for 5 minutes and now we're just going
to<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:22.710> started<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> trophy<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> making

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
to get started on the trophy of making

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.810 
to get started on the trophy of making
process<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.019> let's<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> chunk<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
process so let's take a chunk of this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
process so let's take a chunk of this
first<00:00:27.119> we're<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.869> about<00:00:27.990> half<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
first we're going to use about half of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.700 
first we're going to use about half of
that<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.900> idea<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> try

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that and the idea is we're going to try

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.000 
that and the idea is we're going to try
and<00:00:31.830> roll<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:34.010> into<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.280> rough<00:00:36.030> sausage<00:00:36.630> shape

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
and roll this into a rough sausage shape

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
and roll this into a rough sausage shape
it's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.129> bit<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.460> making<00:00:38.910> gnocchi<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it's a bit like making gnocchi in this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
it's a bit like making gnocchi in this
sense<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.980> want<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.820> light<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
sense we just want to be very light you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.150 
sense we just want to be very light you
don't<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.079> too<00:00:43.260> much<00:00:43.440> flour<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> board

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
don't want too much flour on the board

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
don't want too much flour on the board
or<00:00:44.309> else<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> simply<00:00:44.910> won't<00:00:45.090> stick<00:00:45.450> you'll

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
or else it simply won't stick you'll

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
or else it simply won't stick you'll
just<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.020> pushing<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.250> side<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
just be pushing it from one side of the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.450 
just be pushing it from one side of the
board<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.739> light<00:00:50.010> with

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
board to the other so be very light with

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
board to the other so be very light with
your<00:00:50.579> touch<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.570> we're<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> keep

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
your touch and we're just going to keep

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.950 
your touch and we're just going to keep
doing<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:53.730> want<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> centimeter

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
doing this we want about a centimeter

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.420 
doing this we want about a centimeter
diameter<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.829> half<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.550> inch<00:00:56.699> thickness<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
diameter or half an inch thickness and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
diameter or half an inch thickness and
if<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> breaks<00:00:59.760> at<00:01:00.180> various<00:01:00.480> times<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.899> doesn't

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
if it breaks at various times it doesn't

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.389 
if it breaks at various times it doesn't
matter<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> chop<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
matter because we're going to chop it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.899 
matter because we're going to chop it
this<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.090> next<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.010> keep<00:01:05.220> rolling<00:01:05.700> there

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this way next so just keep rolling there

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
this way next so just keep rolling there
just<00:01:06.299> try<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:06.990> even<00:01:07.560> sausage

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
just try and get a nice even sausage

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
just try and get a nice even sausage
going<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:11.330> that's<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
going on that's more like it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.359 
going on that's more like it
okay<00:01:13.400> nearly<00:01:14.400> done

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.980 

let's<00:01:18.850> chop<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.330> half<00:01:19.360> make<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> bit

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
let's chop that in half make it a bit

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.219 
let's chop that in half make it a bit
easier<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.320> deal<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:22.420> let's<00:01:22.930> chop

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
easier to deal with and now let's chop

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.539 
easier to deal with and now let's chop
one<00:01:23.440> of<00:01:23.530> these<00:01:23.710> into<00:01:24.040> our<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:27.130> our<00:01:27.159> little

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
one of these into our into our little

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.260 
one of these into our into our little
cubes<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.590> not<00:01:29.950> rolling<00:01:30.310> too<00:01:30.640> well<00:01:30.850> let's<00:01:31.060> do

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
cubes it's not rolling too well let's do

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.100 
cubes it's not rolling too well let's do
that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.140 
that
okay<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.040> when<00:01:34.130> I<00:01:34.220> chop<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.550> into<00:01:34.610> roughly

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
okay so when I chop this into roughly

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.590 
okay so when I chop this into roughly
centimeter<00:01:35.830> not<00:01:36.830> cubes<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:37.430> chunks<00:01:40.600> again

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
centimeter not cubes but chunks again

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.580 
centimeter not cubes but chunks again
quite<00:01:41.840> yucky<00:01:42.770> esque

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.370 

do<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.010> all<00:01:49.310> your<00:01:49.340> sausage<00:01:50.030> shape<00:01:50.380> then

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
do that for all your sausage shape then

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.030 
do that for all your sausage shape then
we'll<00:01:51.530> take<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> little<00:01:52.010> bit<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:53.260> flour<00:01:54.260> rough

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
we'll take a little bit of flour rough

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.219 
we'll take a little bit of flour rough
these<00:01:55.280> up<00:01:55.490> together<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.420> make<00:01:56.960> sure<00:01:56.990> they

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
these up together just to make sure they

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.170 
these up together just to make sure they
don't<00:01:57.350> stick<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.159> your<00:01:58.280> hand<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.090> our

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
don't stick to your hand and now our

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.550 
don't stick to your hand and now our
next<00:01:59.300> step<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.720> going<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.930> be<00:02:00.020> rolling<00:02:00.290> our

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
next step is going to be rolling our

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.730 
next step is going to be rolling our
trophy<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.310> shapes<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.720> idea<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.380> press

your hand keep the hands very in line
and<00:02:08.450> very<00:02:08.720> flat<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:09.530> roll<00:02:09.890> off<00:02:10.069> with<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and very flat and just roll off with a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.850 
and very flat and just roll off with a
bottom<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.880> Park<00:02:11.530> easier<00:02:12.530> said<00:02:12.739> than

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
bottom of your Park easier said than

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.430 
bottom of your Park easier said than
done<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.190> truth<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.200> we'll<00:02:15.200> give<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.530> go

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
done in truth but we'll give it a go

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.860 
done in truth but we'll give it a go
well<00:02:18.440> that's<00:02:18.620> not<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> perfect<00:02:19.690> version<00:02:20.690> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
well that's not the perfect version and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.660 
well that's not the perfect version and
memory<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.860> we'll<00:02:22.010> show<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.250> how<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.459> do<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
memory so we'll show you how to do it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.890 
memory so we'll show you how to do it
properly<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.269> second<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:23.900> let's<00:02:24.050> try<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> on

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.009 

that's<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.620> little<00:02:30.799> bit<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.159> like<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:32.019> so

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
that's a little bit more like it so

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.630 
that's a little bit more like it so
you're<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.440> small<00:02:33.769> string<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.190> pasta

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you're just a small string of pasta

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.789 
you're just a small string of pasta
that's<00:02:35.830> basically<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.870> bit<00:02:38.989> twisted

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
that's basically a little bit twisted

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.289 
that's basically a little bit twisted
and<00:02:40.040> these<00:02:40.670> will<00:02:40.819> be<00:02:40.909> served

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
and these will be served

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.820 
and these will be served
typically<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:41.810> degree<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.379> nice<00:02:42.560> pesto

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
typically in degree with a nice pesto

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.160 
typically in degree with a nice pesto
sauce

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.870 

so<00:02:50.710> you<00:02:50.770> can<00:02:50.980> think<00:02:51.160> was<00:02:51.250> my<00:02:51.370> first<00:02:51.610> time<00:02:51.819> doing

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
so you can think was my first time doing

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580 
so you can think was my first time doing
those<00:02:52.270> now<00:02:52.690> we're<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.020> go<00:02:53.140> over<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
those now we're going to go over to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.860 
those now we're going to go over to
memory<00:02:53.860> sir<00:02:54.280> who<00:02:55.000> knows<00:02:55.240> how<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:55.690> them

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
memory sir who knows how to do them

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.530 
memory sir who knows how to do them
properly

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.600 

take<00:03:06.079> a<00:03:06.110> look<00:03:06.319> at<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.469> again

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
take a look at that again

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.090 
take a look at that again
flat<00:03:08.240> palms<00:03:08.540> push<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.470> at<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.710> end<00:03:09.830> and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
flat palms push just at the end and

you're rolling the sausage in the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.180 
you're rolling the sausage in the
beginning<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.250> try<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.209> show<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:46.070> there<00:03:47.070> we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
beginning so try and show you there we

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.010 
beginning so try and show you there we
go<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.790> good<00:03:48.209> size<00:03:48.450> not<00:03:48.810> about

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
go that's a good size not about

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.830 
go that's a good size not about
thickness<00:03:49.970> which<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.420> bit<00:03:51.569> slower

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
thickness which I do that a bit slower

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.059 
thickness which I do that a bit slower
so<00:03:52.080> just<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> middle<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:52.920> both
