00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.969 
sincere weakness for Mac pigments so I
put<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.479> on<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:49.959> i<00:03:50.049> will<00:03:50.229> zoom<00:03:50.259> in<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.799> shake

put it on and i will zoom in and shake
this<00:03:51.159> is<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.459> pigment<00:03:51.819> right<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.269> on<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
this is the pigment right there on the

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.599 
this is the pigment right there on the
inside<00:03:53.229> and<00:03:53.530> then<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.680> sort<00:03:53.979> of<00:03:54.040> faded<00:03:54.430> some

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
inside and then I sort of faded some

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.199 
inside and then I sort of faded some
green<00:03:54.849> into<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.919> feel<00:03:56.919> as<00:03:57.129> if<00:03:57.189> a<00:03:57.579> pigment<00:03:58.000> is

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
green into it I feel as if a pigment is

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.270 
green into it I feel as if a pigment is
such<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.810> great<00:03:59.019> investment<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.739> think<00:03:59.919> everyone

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
such a great investment I think everyone

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.999 
such a great investment I think everyone
should<00:04:00.310> own<00:04:00.639> at<00:04:00.970> least<00:04:01.419> a<00:04:01.629> few<00:04:01.840> probably<00:04:02.500> four

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
should own at least a few probably four

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.059 
should own at least a few probably four
if<00:04:03.419> you<00:04:04.419> can<00:04:04.599> afford<00:04:04.689> it<00:04:05.019> probably<00:04:05.470> about<00:04:05.680> four

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
if you can afford it probably about four

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.559 
if you can afford it probably about four
but<00:04:06.459> i<00:04:06.489> love<00:04:06.759> it<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:06.970> i<00:04:07.090> love<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.419> little

that<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.150> would<00:05:10.180> look<00:05:10.570> like<00:05:10.860> concealer<00:05:11.860> on<00:05:11.889> my

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
that it would look like concealer on my

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.060 
that it would look like concealer on my
