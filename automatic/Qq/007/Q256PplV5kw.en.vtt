00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.240
 here are maxi from china saving you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.340
 should we want you the miele f10 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.400
 just imagine interesting for 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.740
 android player owner of a vendor 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.810
 or in the living room pcs or just around 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 to control the laptop or the computer 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.869
 we do it all again in a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.590
 packaging does not have it that way 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.609
 interesting to recognize 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.349
 in which he tells exclusively as 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 first windows an operation 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.140
 Gegenwelt to the side because everything is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.820
 It involves taking everything once 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 find out a guide which 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.700
 key assignment nothing else important 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.370
 you can set aside then of course 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.949
 but with it the remote control 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.559
 it just works in the usb 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.370
 connected and already 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.579
 works is with memq 808 pass is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.240
 without problems purely on television or 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.010
 other the charging cable with me 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.650
 Although I packed around eight hours 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.549
 have definitely worked with ventilation 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 you do not need any 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.070
 load a load 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.630
 the whole then just over here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.259
 we come to the usb adapter 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.150
 Main the remote control first 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 haptics do not look like sharp edges 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.909
 is really good in the hand piano lacquer 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.590
 Optics and my fingerprints you have to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.460
 But friends with me are annoying 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 not necessarily here in the middle 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 we find the left mouse key with it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.210
 activate as well as the same time 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 mouse and directional buttons you can 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.990
 for example, go through menus or 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 similar to the mouse determine what 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.130
 Of course, sometimes quite important 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 although the family is after two 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
 minutes off alone can 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.569
 Just put me in this twice 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 key presses and otherwise the other 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.650
 Keys are usually self-explanatory 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.860
 Trust a back button of homescreen 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.069
 wait a menu button volume up and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.680
 down burns differently new button and here 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.099
 a search function the other buttons 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.569
 Spend even a smart tv box 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:39.630
 has not worked with 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.640
 each device, for example, input wise 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.489
 set or set the input 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.420
 since we have no device to the mk 808 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.290
 connect 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.049
 here only had unnecessary subtitles 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.030
 also no function similar to this 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.180
 kissing butt looks so beautiful but 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.670
 sometimes has no effect 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.049
 was able to find 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.010
 hereby with this key we open the 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.010
 search the pc or the mmk 808 and the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.280
 other keys are unfortunately occupied 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.769
 but with the mk 808, I have to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.350
 say that my device is not saved 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.859
 or similar and so could functions 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.790
 join in 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.010
 the whole thing is controlled after the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.200
 ordinary principle of one 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.180
 wii-remote control but he should 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.010
 Of course, be clear and of course that 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.310
 big advantage of this device by the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.500
 built-in sensor as the mouse will be 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.500
 once we turn the device off automatically 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.060
 is automatically turned off and so on 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.709
 we do not get a bit shaky 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.280
 another field and can without 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.650
 The keyboard is typing problems 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.239
 really good in the hand 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:58.600
 why this loop is laughing here 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.120
 first stays open maybe for 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.639
 one or the other was practically that 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.190
 us layout you have to get used to 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.109
 but at least the pressure points are the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.139
 keyboard very well you just get one 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.930
 Feedback when pressing a button 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.639
 and of course no one type 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.470
 long contributions just like at 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.280
 google or similar should not 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.370
 his problems 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.710
 as you see 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.360
 every button is double and occupied by 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.710
 press once in the comments 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.139
 dive on that one pressed 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.880
 the fn key would have to hold that you 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.340
 This definitely not the case 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.340
 which is once pressed once and 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.770
 already you can on the two occupancy 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.000
 access again press leads then 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.340
 in addition to the original ones 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.979
 Occupancy gets here too 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:51.030
 Directional keys enter key or the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:54.240
 menu button in general very much 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 satisfied with this device design and 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.350
 Of course everything should not be in the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.919
 in the foreground, the controls are very high 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.120
 precise 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.830
 even if at the beginning just when that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.289
 is a little further away from the device or 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.860
 not exactly to the tv is something 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.180
 getting used to is at the beginning but 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.610
 then you will definitely find his 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.830
 fixed point with which one can work and 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.530
 from then on, the whole should not be a problem 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.650
 his 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:26.460
 so much for the mill f10 should you still 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.840
 further questions have just for occupancy 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.729
 the other buttons 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.970
 there are certainly a few professionals that 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.860
 that can be done and the input 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.389
 can read this device and so on 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.979
 single functions can put on it 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.960
 then just put them in the 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.610
 comments and yes I hope these 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.840
 small imagination this first time 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.229
 I first had an idea of â€‹â€‹myself 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.229
 like
