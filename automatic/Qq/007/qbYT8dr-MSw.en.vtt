is that i've been able to maintain that

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.340 
is that i've been able to maintain that
actually<00:00:23.699> I've<00:00:23.850> been<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.810> down

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

up I'm 8143 but on average this whole

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.170 
up I'm 8143 but on average this whole
time<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.960> 1.5<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.829> won't<00:00:35.010> go<00:00:35.180> higher

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
time I think that 1.5 I won't go higher

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.520 
time I think that 1.5 I won't go higher
than<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.320> good<00:00:37.469> thing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
than that and that's a good thing

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
than that and that's a good thing
because<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.280> honestly<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:39.629> kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.899> afraid

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because I honestly was kind of afraid

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040 
because I honestly was kind of afraid
that<00:00:40.530> after<00:00:40.800> died<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.790> would<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.570> back<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.899> my

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that after died I would go back to my

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.799 
that after died I would go back to my
normal<00:00:43.110> eating<00:00:43.590> habits<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:45.660> just

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
normal eating habits and I would just

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
normal eating habits and I would just
regain<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.770> weight<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.190> honest<00:00:50.640> don't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I realized that you save so many

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
I realized that you save so many
calories<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.210> drinking<00:01:42.570> water<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
calories just like drinking water the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
calories just like drinking water the
calories<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> coke<00:01:44.580> give<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
calories that I can of coke give you you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
calories that I can of coke give you you
could<00:01:45.780> save<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.090> something

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
could save and use them on something

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.980 
could save and use them on something
yummier<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.289> know<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.759> pop<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
yummier you know so i think that pop and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
yummier you know so i think that pop and
juice<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> something<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.939> think<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
juice is something that I think is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
juice is something that I think is
really<00:01:54.149> easy<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.840> sacrifice<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:56.009> opposed<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really easy to sacrifice as opposed to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.130 
really easy to sacrifice as opposed to
sweets<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.299> other<00:01:58.789> good<00:01:59.789> stuff<00:02:00.110> actually<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
but usually I finish the whole thing in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.570 
but usually I finish the whole thing in
one<00:02:18.600> day<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.799> its<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:20.790> good<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.989> helps<00:02:22.500> me

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
one day and its really good it helps me

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.090 
one day and its really good it helps me
it<00:02:23.580> keeps<00:02:23.850> me<00:02:24.120> from<00:02:24.350> getting<00:02:25.350> really<00:02:25.739> bloated

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
it keeps me from getting really bloated

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.320 
it keeps me from getting really bloated
and<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.390> keeps<00:02:27.630> me<00:02:27.870> from<00:02:28.459> getting<00:02:29.459> heavy<00:02:29.970> in

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and it keeps me from getting heavy in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.190 
and it keeps me from getting heavy in
the<00:02:30.510> mornings<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.170> stuff<00:02:31.440> i<00:02:31.650> think<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:33.200> i'm

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the mornings and stuff i think that i'm

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.750 
the mornings and stuff i think that i'm
not<00:02:34.260> sure<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:34.769> maybe<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.640> reason

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
not sure but maybe this is the reason

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.410 
not sure but maybe this is the reason
why<00:02:35.940> I've<00:02:36.209> been<00:02:36.329> able<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.630> 90

something i will try to help as much as

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.720 
something i will try to help as much as
I<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.780> I'm<00:03:38.380> not<00:03:38.560> really<00:03:38.739> an<00:03:38.920> expert<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.549> this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
I can I'm not really an expert on this

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.770 
I can I'm not really an expert on this

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
but I think it helps when you have

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
but I think it helps when you have
feedback<00:03:44.079> from<00:03:44.440> other<00:03:44.620> people<00:03:44.980> who<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.280> done

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
feedback from other people who have done

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.640

it<00:03:45.489> who<00:03:46.209> have<00:03:46.390> done<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.109> who<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:47.440> like

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
it who have done this and who have like

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.440 
it who have done this and who have like
a<00:03:47.859> river<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.130> experience
