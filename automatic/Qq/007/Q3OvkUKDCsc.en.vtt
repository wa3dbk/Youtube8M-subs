00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.860
 and hello, beloved boys born of merit 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.690
 here in my channel I am rich then 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.610
 let's go today adam buxar a game I have 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.670
 retired a few days ago but I have not 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.170
 still had time to open it then 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.610
 think about it 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.270
 let's see, let unboxing 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.129
 precisely of amy and 2k 15 or more than i 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.640
 in short, feasts, that's what you want 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.370
 utter it to the English pussy 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.920
 a little oil took to playstation 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.739
 4 but you can differences with juan like 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.680
 xbox one I have not received 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.750
 so it is absolutely identical 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 I didn't hear any particular difference 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.860
 precisely and obviously I have taken or we say 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.720
 preferred to take the next gen version 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.269
 france but the Kurds respect that 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.940
 with playstation 3 gems over 60 why 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.729
 is a title of spatial gravity 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.900
 guys so really not worth it 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.610
 of us we must play it to the fullest 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.409
 surely I will make them play me 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.200
 would like to do the boys season 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.130
 now it will try a little to see if it is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.969
 possible or not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.430
 and what can be done to bring you one 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.750
 series perhaps with weekly expiration 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.159
 that is a week episode 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.649
 but in short we come to see a bit also 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.479
 if it may interest you, let's go and see 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.710
 now call the talk so this 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.109
 packaging and what it includes game 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.829
 and whatever else then goes well on the cover 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.060
 we have kevin durant is vp precisely of the 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.159
 last season if I'm not wrong 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.259
 because the boys last year I have not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.240
 followed in I love basketball but 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:00.280
 I missed it last year anyway 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:05.380
 va bÃ¨ m2k 15 now the writing is like 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.700
 lucid tradition but by now precisely 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.490
 how many times the plants were now 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.590
 map a lot of times the whole 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.180
 package all the cover presents 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.100
 details that then they do see 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.470
 applied stop brilli cicche and vi 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.780
 I'm doing to lose sight of it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 because with the jacket 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.540
 let's say in plastic seen the really 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.200
 blinding so we have to see 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.000
 which includes kevin durant bp bonus pack 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.100
 so this version of the day one 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 the soundtrack edited by di pharrell 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.720
 williams put you lucky 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.600
 sorry ok ok the soundtrack care 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.200
 of pharrell williams we are remembered 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.000
 and now includes 25 euroleague teams 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.640
 basketball then those too 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.820
 of the Euroleague is over there which is obviously 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.560
 and let's see how times your moment was 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.260
 barton didn't read everything to me 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.620
 however incredible game dynamics and 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.190
 much more so that remembers that of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.750
 ali summer players improved for 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.420
 increase the show in more there are 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.900
 there is also the shaquille pre-race 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.300
 o'neal and johnson me and so on 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.590
 in short, some new features they have 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.690
 introduced my career so you can 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.200
 to live the life of a player 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.290
 of the nba 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.540
 then there is my park that frankly not 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.350
 I know what it is because I don't remember 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.100
 more 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.170
 Join your player in one 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.420
 of the three new modes and communities on 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.730
 my park and then play the pitch ok 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.709
 was what I remembered me 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.070
 it seemed it was so it's the pitch 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.410
 practically a multiplayer brunette 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.690
 totally new here it was not there 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.060
 in the last edition 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.650
 and in fact it didn't seem to have many 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.230
 remember I just saw some videos 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.959
 review that talked about it then is 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.570
 this is my team 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.160
 obviously this is the mode for 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.230
 manage the team and is euroleague 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.229
 basketball that reminds us that there 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.430
 are 25 best teams in Europe 11 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.120
 heart of which present for the first 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.960
 absolute time so there is also the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.210
 armani ea7 seven and anything else his 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.390
 maccabi tel aviv and so on 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.400
 let's see obviously kevin durant 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.539
 stands out at large if we see 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.870
 bet of fire 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.180
 all ok 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.599
 be patient patience mother meat a 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.039
 little to a little desire to work 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.840
 then do not see in the specifications i 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:59.400
 Requirements Required 14 offline players 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:05:01.490
 network players from 2 to 10 49 gigabytes of 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.810
 minimum space girl a nice bang 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.220
 gradation function o que habito 80 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.020
 harmotto production feet supported 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.360
 also compatible playstation camera 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.220
 so let's see this too 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:18.539
 I'm a bit lost though it's a game that 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.560
 however I really like shows and 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.380
 here is what I wanted to show me 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.159
 first, that is, you see that it is all at 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.419
 player 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.630
 apart that hovers minds in relief 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.169
 you see and it is a little all lights from 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.770
 cover 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:38.580
 it really feels good 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.550
 almost a much brighter steelbook 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.780
 of the previous version in via 2k 14 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.490
 that I have here is fine I can show it to you 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.159
 because so much the same continues to make me 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.930
 the reflections excuse me anyway here 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.430
 very very pretty really a lot more la 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.710
 girl both from me and many more 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.440
 covers were back this way 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.170
 inside we obviously find 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.570
 Game Burrai we then cover 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.500
 a shoe doesn't want to know how to stay 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.800
 mona 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.510
 but here behind the bonus package that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.850
 will reduce is vp here it is who understands 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.490
 let's look at 5,000 virtual cures 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.960
 nancy that virtual currency a card 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.640
 of an international player for the 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.300
 my team two packs of cards for 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160
 my team 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.430
 kevin durant and leg warmer in mine 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.750
 player therefore includes both some 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:32.540
 objects for my player for the 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.580
 modality that then also for what it is 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.120
 the similar fifa ultimate team mode 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:42.680
 in the meantime, here he is lost 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.580
 everything ok so also what of 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.290
 normal 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.300
 let's go to have read more full - bodied 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.300
 torazzi more color composer that is 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.640
 really amazing all 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.170
 I have tears in my eyes also because i 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.350
 guys look at the amount of 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.720
 commands that you need to master 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.060
 and is also less technical than the 2 al 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.280
 2 k 14 because they have it slightly 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:09.370
 simplified in some things 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.370
 really look at things 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.700
 yes ok it's in color 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.300
 obviously there are no figures for these 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.800
 figures is not that they serve much though 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.290
 however already the fact that at least it 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.320
 both color background is good is a good one 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:27.320
 what guys and have a game that 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:32.720
 deserves maybe does not deserve the 75 euros that 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:35.570
 they are in demand of official price however 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.890
 however boys care both of the game 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.870
 that also we are going to see 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.460
 obviously with some gameplay too 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.410
 in which they also put in 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.350
 packaging in packaging the whole is 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:48.200
 remarkable guys really would be nice 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.350
 see more games so it would be nice that 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.660
 This was the standard is still okay 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.919
 I remind you to leave a comment for 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.720
 I do not like your divine one 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.250
 to let me know if you liked and us 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.760
 see you at the next hello video 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.760
 guys I have there
