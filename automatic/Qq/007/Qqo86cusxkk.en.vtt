00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.399
 time 1 to 5 in live host this video 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.690
 full if it's not complete well I'll go 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.030
 to say how this works at the beginning 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.400
 I show you a little of the functions of 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.650
 watch that we quickly give ourselves to 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.780
 bottom of them and in the end I have my point 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.520
 of sight just like we compared this 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.260
 watch slightly with other watches 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.690
 Chinese to see if it's worth it or not 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.090
 spend this kind of amount the stress 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.440
 it or in other watches and good - but not 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.120
 he looked so bored not everything is 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.920
 showing each function of the clock of the 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.119
 web saying for once I'll tell you 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.490
 that all functions work 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.080
 correctly that is to say for did not forget 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.580
 so boring so long everything is not 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.290
 showing each operation of the clock 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.700
 I'm just going to tell you what 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.990
 that the clock that is capable of being given 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.580
 that these functions is nothing else 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.320
 world functions that we have analyzed in 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.970
 several clocks previously first that 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.590
 we get together with this screen thing that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.020
 it may be changing in the menu 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.300
 options and another thing that bothered me 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.190
 slightly is that good the color 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.989
 green yellow can not be seen very well 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.030
 in the camera as you can see the no 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.770
 Contrast but well let's continue with 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 the revised basically that we have the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.380
 date we have the time we have the day of 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.619
 the week here we have two buttons 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.090
 and likewise the message button and 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.409
 well we went to see the icons 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.969
 options you have to extract it 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.100
 First of all, we are going to return 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.899
 we find the icon called and with 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.390
 the courier what to do 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.490
 contacts call records options 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.799
 bluetooth notifications capture 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 remote in this case should be 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.159
 obviously active bluetooth we go 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.920
 back we have monitors of 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.409
 dream thing that is the new funny joke 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.079
 how good the watch's battery is not so 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.020
 good as it lasts more than a day 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.700
 no load is to say if you bring your watch 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.890
 from the morning that is seven of the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.569
 tomorrow until four or five in the afternoon 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.640
 it's already when I take home and choose 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.170
 what occupies a load or depending 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.459
 the messages that you were receiving and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.110
 if you use it to do 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.399
 calls or not if you do not use your to 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
 this calls and you just used it 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.959
 to receive notifications the battery 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 will last much longer I can say that of 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.459
 7 in the morning easily jaime to 9 10 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.590
 at night however I do not think the 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.750
 watch is the best thing to sleep in 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 sedimentary reminder we move 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.349
 we have the pons complexion that we are going to have 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.180
 this barcode to download 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.160
 africa bluetooth application 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.230
 calculator alarm 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.030
 I find it quite practical has a 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.890
 small calculator on hand profile 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.480
 yes it is in sound that if it is in 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.730
 board that exists in general and so on 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 fang manager in this case if you install 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.240
 the odd photo by the PC at 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.860
 watch and the batteries will be able to 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.990
 visualize as well as play 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.610
 music thing that I was reproducing 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.140
 music on the clock given that good the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 control are made quite small for 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.410
 my finger we have what it looks at being the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.530
 camera that as you can see here we have 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.200
 the camera is there and good to take the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.390
 photo then we press and it is ending 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.670
 our phone when it is through 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.290
 bluetooth we will return us as well 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.630
 how good we can make a small 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.340
 recording I think that 15 seconds has 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
 according to maki want to watch some video 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.850
 everything works wonderfully the video I think 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.620
 that I already deleted it had a video for 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.420
 visualize it a fairly short video 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.520
 since no clock storage 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.350
 It is the best elevator notes recorder 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.620
 of heart rate that if I want we do not go 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.819
 to use 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.819
 we give you start 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.820
 and as you can see I have a 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.890
 total of 105 bpm the clock also counts 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.840
 with thermometer as you can see and by 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
 course a function that I thought 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.770
 interesting and good then in this part 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.540
 we see the cardiac course right now 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.020
 I'm doing voice over, I'm talking 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.430
 about the shot because I was quite agitated 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.260
 I'm making noise I'm moving 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.780
 much cut the take to make this 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
 part much shorter and show them that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.350
 this is working in the way 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.760
 correct and some try what I would say 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.610
 all that the screen is curved sometimes 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.690
 you can detail a little to go to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.580
 the options that are a bit down 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.460
 As you can see we are going here to display 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.050
 we can change the wallpaper 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.630
 let's put for example the 1 that 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.730
 would be this being all black for 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.680
 that he does not go to see programs later if 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.200
 we have to put on the display of the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.750
 on what we are going to put any watch 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.640
 and well let's block the clock and how 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.950
 you can see comes with this background styles 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.510
 rolex and of course what you do 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.920
 completely black screen so you do not 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.390
 is bothering the time to record to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.040
 along the canal and we've had the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.930
 possibility of making three different 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.820
 smart watch is that two of them have 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.230
 rubber strap I can tell you that the 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.269
 experience that I had with these three 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.220
 watches in this case if we live 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.289
 in the rubber strings in this case the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.639
 metal strap at least in this 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.530
 I can tell you that I prefer 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.879
 much the rome strap for the fact that 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.680
 good the strap I say table what is 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.960
 can easily adapt to your hands is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.240
 say has much more sizes to 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.860
 difference of this watch this watch 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 solved with three levels that would come 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.220
 being large medium and in this case 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.900
 small on the smallest level the clock 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 I'm pretty big as you can 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.919
 see me nothing on the clock that if you ask me 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.220
 here being new and the clock because the 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.569
 functions very well very nice design 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.370
 Excellent viewing angle screen is 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.169
 He sees very well in the sun but good at 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.150
 moment to have the clock that is for what 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.860
 that we use it but we do not want to have it 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.509
 our hands and we want rock it 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.030
 feel good there is once the 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.740
 11 clock if I was a little disappointed 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.539
 I do not know if I could a watchmaker 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.550
 and tell them that they adjust my watch 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.919
 cutting these parts I do not know if he has 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.719
 available or if this is present option 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.069
 on the clock but good, something also like 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.750
 I would mention would be the 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.310
 metal a lot you see that the clock is 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.530
 metal and the truth is that the clock that 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.330
 it looks better than it feels not me 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.280
 Misunderstand the eye does not feel bad 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.780
 but he had more expectations of the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.560
 metal when we pay for a watch 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.910
 smart 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.950
 in this case it is more 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.140
 we're just not going through a 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.030
 large amount this robot has a value 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.030
 of more than $ 100 however in 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.620
 jirbet you find it at 63 dollars the 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900
 canned for registration and good 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.850
 when it boils there are depressions 63 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.740
 dollars relativity quality-price 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.630
 well, it does improve, however, 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.730
 together I would prefer to have a clock 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.530
 rubber to a watch with a metal strap 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.390
 because good the metal strap is not going to 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.250
 be of high quality therefore when 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.080
 we buy one of the chinese we pay more 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.240
 for functions functions that go very 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.070
 well in this watch functions that many 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.230
 of you do not use given that good 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.970
 more than anything as about having a 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.010
 smart watch in a few words it 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.870
 try to have your notifications in the 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.550
 not so much that we're going to be 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.260
 using all the applications that 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.430
 we are going to use the camera 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.350
 when we have the camera to our 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.970
 phone that we are going to record when 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.430
 we have the video recorder in our 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.600
 phone that we go listen to music and 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.480
 when we have our speakers 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.520
 phone in a few words the functions 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.470
 that we really use are functions 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.300
 that brings the phone and the clock more than 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.490
 nothing we use when you bring a design 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.830
 nice and it's a design that brings more than 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.969
 nothing the design does not feel so nice 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.679
 how do you think 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.779
 point of view says that you respect it 

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:38.749
 these were my opinions I hope you've 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.729
 liked the video and if I do not like and 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.259
 supposed to subscribe to the channel that swims 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.209
 more than saying I am with closing the 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.209
 channel 69 and with this I say goodbye thank you
