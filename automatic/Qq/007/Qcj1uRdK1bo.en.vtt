00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 for the exercise of diseases 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 infectious diseases a sample of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 people hospitalized in the hospital 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.219
 of Pennsylvania and retrospectively 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.929
 what was done can check if these 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 they received a new antibiotic 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 during your hospitalization the total 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.529
 people that was taken was 25 asks us 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 calculate the average the median duration 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 of hospitalization for the 25 patients 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.279
 calculates the standard deviation and the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.680
 range of duration of hospitalization of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.190
 the 25 patients 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.480
 and asks us additional to this multiply 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.600
 this data by a constant 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.360
 and see what the effect is like 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.550
 about the median about fashion over 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.160
 median geometric mean and over 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.640
 mango 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.060
 then we found that the median for 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.800
 this case gave us 8.6 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.650
 what does it mean that on average 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.420
 Patients last 8 points 6 days 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.290
 hospitalized a median of 8 what 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.660
 it means that 50% of patients 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.120
 they have a hospitalization period 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.490
 less than 8 days a standard deviation 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.000
 of 5.7 that tells us that on average 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 each data goes away 5 points 5 points 7 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.070
 days of the median a minimum value of 3 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.130
 a maximum value of 30 days of 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.260
 hospitalization with a range of 27 a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.840
 fashion of 5 a metric measure of 7.3 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.640
 we can go to this data we can 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.700
 divide into five classes that for this 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 case would be here and I know it's our 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.940
 constant positive why we're going 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.710
 to multiply that is the rank between each 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.040
 class 5.4 by multiplying it by 5.4 as much 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.410
 the average as the median the range the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.950
 fashion and the average metric we see that all 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.409
 increase and obviously it will have a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.610
 the patients are going to have an increase in 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 your hospitalization 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.470
 the second exercise that we chose was the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.180
 exercise of microbiology then in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.120
 this study in this exercise what is 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.940
 made was to carry out a study where 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.310
 will show that in the soybeans 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.930
 inoculated with nitrogen had a higher 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.810
 performance and a further increase in its 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.100
 size therefore its weight then what 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.980
 was done in this study was 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.440
 select group groups 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.660
 because he was going to be subjected to the inoculation 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.240
 inoculation with nitrogen and the group 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.330
 control that was not going to be submitted to 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.700
 no change for handling these two 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.550
 groups used similar conditions 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.940
 the soil was handled in the same way and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.120
 all the features were the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.750
 they ask us what they ask of us 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.810
 in this exercise then it is to find 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.060
 descriptive statistics for both 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.000
 the groups inoculated as for the group 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.370
 in or inoculated additionally they ask us 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.580
 that by means of graphic methods 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.440
 let's compare the two groups and give a 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.720
 general concept a general impression 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.850
 regarding the increase that there was in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.730
 weight of the pods in each of the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.830
 groups that is what we are going to measure 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.410
 then in the data presented 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.410
 for the group inoculated and for the group 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.760
 eno inoculated what we did was 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.100
 determine the mean the median in the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.500
 standard deviation variance 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.980
 quartile and the range and range for each 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.140
 one of these then we observe that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.180
 as a response we had an average or a 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.000
 average of the weights average for 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.410
 the group the average weight of the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.570
 pod for the inoculated group was 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.510
 163 and for the group in or inoculated was 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.700
 minor with 108 grams 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.120
 the median tells us that for the group 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.090
 of inoculated soybeans 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.650
 50% of the grains have a weight 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.549
 less than 164 grams and the group of 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.190
 not inoculated weighing less than 0 196 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.530
 by 7 grams which indicates that the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.950
 gain in the in the group of the no 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.940
 inoculated was less weight gain 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.620
 with respect to the standard deviation 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.049
 then we observe that the data 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.139
 for the inoculated group they move away in a 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.479
 0 39 grams with respect to the median 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.960
 whereas the non-inoculated ones is a 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.850
 higher proportion with 0.47 grams with 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.430
 relationship to the median what it tells us 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.070
 that the group's data in the data from 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.160
 weight of the group of non-inoculated beans 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.449
 have a greater dispersion for the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.210
 percentile 25 quartile 1 we observe that the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.490
 25% of the data of the groups of the group 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.229
 of inoculated beans have a weight 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:58.420
 less than 139 grams in its pods and 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:01.720
 those not inoculated at 0.82 grams 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.900
 and we can say with this then that in 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.800
 the study was confirmed the hypothesis 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.510
 alternates showing that the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.330
 supply of inoculation with 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.340
 nitrogen if it has influence on the 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.240
 increase in the size of the increase in 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.360
 weight of 28 grain bean 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.870
 demonstrating this with an alliance in the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.700
 for the group of inoculated grains of 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.200
 186 and for the non- inoculated group a 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.960
 variation less than 1.23 grams respect 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.040
 to the graph where they ask us to compare the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.200
 weight of the pod of the soybeans 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.530
 won in each of the two groups 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.840
 so for this what we did was 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.390
 make the sum of the total weights 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.240
 of the pods gained in the two groups 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.400
 and regarding this we get the relationship 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.380
 100 percent the frequency 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.090
 relative for each of the groups 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.220
 then we observe that the group 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.400
 highlighted with blue is the group of 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:07.419
 inoculated grains where we see that 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.340
 60% increased its weight and the group of 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.290
 unlinked corresponding to the other 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.870
 portion of the graph where you see that 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.870
 there was a smaller increase that was 40 of 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.780
 corresponding to 40% for response to 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.340
 the last question we can say that 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.220
 according to what we observe then the 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.360
 made of inoculating the soy beans with 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.520
 nitrogen if they have a direct relationship 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.550
 with the change with the increase in the weight of 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.240
 the pod of the grain evidencing then that 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.889
 the grains inoculated with the nitrogen 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.280
 they presented a greater increase in their weight 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:45.000
 and therefore a bigger and bigger and 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.000
 greater performance
