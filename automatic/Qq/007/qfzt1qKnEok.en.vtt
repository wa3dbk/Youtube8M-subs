00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
off the label because the label will

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.140 
off the label because the label will
catch<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.639> fire

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
and then to make sure you open it if you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.230 
and then to make sure you open it if you
don't<00:05:18.360> it'll<00:05:18.629> explode<00:05:22.729> see<00:05:23.729> if<00:05:23.789> we<00:05:23.879> get<00:05:24.030> down

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
don't it'll explode see if we get down

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.179 
don't it'll explode see if we get down
inside<00:05:24.449> of<00:05:24.780> there<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.710> want<00:05:28.889> to<00:05:28.919> crack

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
inside of there you just want to crack

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.619 
inside of there you just want to crack
far<00:05:29.490> enough<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:29.819> where<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:30.000> air<00:05:30.120> can<00:05:30.389> still

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
far enough to where the air can still

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:37.100 
far enough to where the air can still
get<00:05:30.780> through<00:05:32.719> and<00:05:33.719> it'll<00:05:35.569> heat<00:05:36.569> everything<00:05:36.810> up

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
get through and it'll heat everything up

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.260 
get through and it'll heat everything up
now<00:05:41.419> I've<00:05:42.419> done<00:05:42.599> one<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.840> these<00:05:43.229> another<00:05:43.860> time

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
now I've done one of these another time

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.119 
now I've done one of these another time
and<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.139> little<00:05:46.319> bit<00:05:46.409> larger<00:05:46.800> piece<00:05:46.979> of

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
and with a little bit larger piece of

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.890 
and with a little bit larger piece of
wood<00:05:47.279> is<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.460> lot<00:05:47.729> easier<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.210> split<00:05:49.310> but<00:05:50.310> um

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.209 

it's<00:05:54.900> all<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.199> same<00:05:55.379> no<00:05:55.620> matter<00:05:55.740> what<00:05:56.009> size

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
it's all the same no matter what size

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.559 
it's all the same no matter what size
just<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.819> larger<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.300> wood<00:05:57.449> easier<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:57.960> is

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
just the larger the wood easier it is

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.339 
just the larger the wood easier it is
because<00:06:00.569> you<00:06:00.659> don't<00:06:00.779> have<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:00.930> be<00:06:01.020> as<00:06:01.110> careful

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
because you don't have to be as careful

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.640 
because you don't have to be as careful
with<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:02.719> but<00:06:03.719> it<00:06:03.840> works<00:06:04.020> off<00:06:04.199> all<00:06:04.349> the<00:06:04.469> same

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
with it but it works off all the same

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:17.480 
with it but it works off all the same
principle

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.730 

and

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.469 

Suz<00:06:24.340> already<00:06:24.580> getting<00:06:24.729> hot

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.390 

and<00:06:29.990> that's<00:06:30.349> how<00:06:30.469> you<00:06:30.529> make<00:06:30.710> a<00:06:30.740> Swedish<00:06:31.159> stove

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
and that's how you make a Swedish stove

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.140 
and that's how you make a Swedish stove
thanks

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.570 

after<00:06:36.930> note<00:06:37.080> here's<00:06:37.919> what<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:38.250> inside<00:06:38.550> looks

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
after note here's what the inside looks

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.300 
after note here's what the inside looks
like<00:06:40.280> this<00:06:41.280> was<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.550> bottom<00:06:42.889> and<00:06:43.889> here<00:06:44.070> is<00:06:44.190> the

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
like this was the bottom and here is the

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.310 
like this was the bottom and here is the
top<00:06:45.830> you<00:06:46.830> look<00:06:47.389> the<00:06:48.389> very<00:06:48.600> tops<00:06:48.870> are<00:06:49.110> still

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
top you look the very tops are still

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:57.110 
top you look the very tops are still
intact<00:06:54.110> Thanks
