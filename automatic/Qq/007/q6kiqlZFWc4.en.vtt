00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 danny you intimate with three one this was what 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 you had expected in advance 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 did not expect and did expect something 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 we hoped it was 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.490
 it seemed pretty easy from the side 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.440
 you feel that way in the field 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.430
 closely not that but i think the first 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 if we do 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.990
 absolute parent and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 that we tried to get under the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.480
 busy that feyenoord was going to put there 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 to get out of it is to put it down 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 that we have the pressure on them 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 put 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 I think that good that succeeded 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.099
 and that we are certainly the first half there 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.250
 definitely deserved to be on the lead 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.899
 and of course a nice 2000 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.600
 couple of dangerous when I have moments there 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.950
 he had consolidated it well and with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 to score any luck yet count 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.570
 but then it seems easy 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.350
 everyone has given everything and not in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 in cells 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.329
 totally broken the players have guess 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 responded very well to what we what 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 we actually opposed this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.890
 feyenoord because namely 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.510
 feyenoord the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 in the cockpit really wants to be in that wash 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.140
 come and I think you know that for sure 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 protrudes knocked down we did a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.650
 second not in urban areas at two we 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.430
 dared to play football that was quite 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 very good 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.119
 maybe that was the big one 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 difference with last Thursday 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.830
 now there are other law series assumption 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.230
 universe itself and then you see that too 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.690
 naturally also plays a role 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.070
 here the ambience is also another 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.520
 ambiance 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.370
 npcf and from your past here and we 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 will have good past we made two 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.960
 excellent year 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040
 I certainly can 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.729
 I important for the ten less 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.140
 I stand before and yes and if only 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.540
 nice of course that they also go together 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.210
 with a win , 2 becomes the magic 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.360
 number through this year or not 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.880
 well i like to think yes 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.100
 would be nice but no it won't 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.440
 normally good so far 3 fresh there 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 scored 3 times and 2 times would be nice 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.680
 if that if that fullness hama it goes like that 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.850
 of course not football 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.290
 We also come contests that you have none 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.600
 a shot or maybe you are the 1st 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.000
 ship but most important there 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.610
 very very 3c of course that the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.110
 plow uncle wind and that happened today 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.850
 and then it's ultimately about i got 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860
 its room for my thanks what the construction 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.680
 yes yes that of my three axes 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.660
 city today has a nice shape and it has 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.989
 a mega mine I stand before me one on one 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.940
 with 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.470
 with bahia and i can take him inside 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.450
 take 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.180
 then sit the long corner so that the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.950
 how important this victory is 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.880
 because it's that feyenoord your co-leader 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.340
 is for awareness 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.380
 how good you are or how high you are 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.640
 well it gives of course but so we then 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 one way trust and looked i am sitting now 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.790
 not so much 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.410
 whether you do or do not plan there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.120
 is more in van 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.280
 after 34 games then you should 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.600
 but it's a nice feeling 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.769
 if you are now to where 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.390
 yes this gives the chin gives confidence 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.799
 years gives crown to 10 to gives 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.060
 throne and everything and everyone 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.220
 I think we don't just have one 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.310
 played a good game but there 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.079
 are still early in the season and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.880
 it is at least that it is nice 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.579
 we know that we are as a group 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.799
 that we develop and that is 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.430
 I think the most important French and and we 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.890
 can do that too 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.040
 copla results so we need this line 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.040
 continue
