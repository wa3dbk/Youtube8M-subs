not an air stone but airline tubing and
the<00:01:10.270> air<00:01:10.420> pump<00:01:10.719> to<00:01:10.959> add<00:01:11.459> air<00:01:12.459> bubbles<00:01:12.850> and

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
the air pump to add air bubbles and

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.489 
the air pump to add air bubbles and
oxygen<00:01:13.389> into<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.659> water<00:01:13.929> when<00:01:14.380> you're

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
oxygen into the water when you're

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:16.080 
oxygen into the water when you're
running<00:01:14.619> different<00:01:14.859> medicines<00:01:15.340> definitely

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
running different medicines definitely

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.779 
running different medicines definitely
helps<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.259> fish<00:01:17.469> breathe<00:01:17.770> better<00:01:18.039> as<00:01:18.340> well<00:01:18.490> so

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
helps the fish breathe better as well so

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:19.709 
helps the fish breathe better as well so
definitely<00:01:19.119> do<00:01:19.299> that

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
definitely do that

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.050 
definitely do that
what<00:01:19.929> about<00:01:20.020> live<00:01:20.380> rock<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:20.859> sand<00:01:21.069> we<00:01:21.909> don't

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
what about live rock and sand we don't

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.609 
what about live rock and sand we don't
recommend<00:01:22.299> running<00:01:22.630> live<00:01:22.959> rock<00:01:23.170> or<00:01:23.319> sand<00:01:23.560> in

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
recommend running live rock or sand in

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.870 
recommend running live rock or sand in
the<00:01:23.709> quarantine<00:01:24.039> because<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.429> does<00:01:24.639> give<00:01:24.850> a

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the quarantine because it does give a

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.940

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
you do the water changes well it depends

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.480 
you do the water changes well it depends
usually<00:02:22.930> at<00:02:23.050> least<00:02:23.110> once<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.710> week<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.250> does

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
usually at least once a week but it does

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.520 
usually at least once a week but it does
depend<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:25.060> your<00:02:25.180> nitrate<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.870> ammonia

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
depend on your nitrate and ammonia

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.050 
depend on your nitrate and ammonia
levels<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:26.980> if<00:02:27.040> those<00:02:27.160> are<00:02:27.370> high<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.880> want<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
levels so if those are high you want to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.310 
levels so if those are high you want to
go<00:02:28.180> ahead<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> water<00:02:28.720> change<00:02:28.780> even<00:02:29.230> if

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
go ahead and do a water change even if

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.620 
go ahead and do a water change even if
it<00:02:29.410> means<00:02:29.590> doing<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.010> twice<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> week<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.760> keep

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
it means doing it twice a week just keep

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.940 
it means doing it twice a week just keep
those<00:02:31.780> levels<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.230> line<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.560> you'll<00:02:32.680> be<00:02:32.770> good

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
those levels in line and you'll be good

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.040 
those levels in line and you'll be good
okay<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.060> are<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.240> different<00:02:34.570> signs<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
okay so what are the different signs of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.780 
okay so what are the different signs of
illness<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.440> what<00:02:35.770> types<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.160> medicines<00:02:36.610> do

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
illness and what types of medicines do

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880 
illness and what types of medicines do
you<00:02:36.910> use<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.360> treat<00:02:37.570> those<00:02:37.750> well<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.470> couple

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
you use to treat those well a couple

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.300 
you use to treat those well a couple

I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.350> easily<00:04:33.710> four<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:33.980> five<00:04:34.130> fish<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.400> a

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
I think easily four to five fish in a

tank like this and what if you're using
one<00:04:36.530> type<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.770> medicine<00:04:37.310> but<00:04:37.460> then<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:37.760> want

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
one type of medicine but then you want

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.190 
one type of medicine but then you want
to<00:04:38.060> use<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> different<00:04:38.630> medicine<00:04:38.900> that

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
to use a different medicine that

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.810 
to use a different medicine that
shouldn't<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.680> mixed<00:04:39.950> how<00:04:40.280> do<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.490> get<00:04:40.610> rid<00:04:40.790> of

shouldn't be mixed how do you get rid of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.220 
shouldn't be mixed how do you get rid of
the<00:04:40.970> first<00:04:41.150> matter<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.690> good<00:04:41.840> question

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230
