00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
shortening it's a very specific kind of

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
shortening it's a very specific kind of
shortening<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.260> called<00:00:28.470> high<00:00:28.710> ratio

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
shortening is called high ratio

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330 
shortening is called high ratio
shortening<00:00:29.960> Crisco<00:00:30.960> used<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> very

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
shortening Crisco used to be the very

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
shortening Crisco used to be the very
best<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.840> non

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
best for this but now it's non

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
best for this but now it's non
hydrogenated<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.520> no<00:00:35.730> longer<00:00:35.760> high

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hydrogenated and it's no longer high

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
hydrogenated and it's no longer high
ratio<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> switch<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.579> something

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
ratio so we have to switch to something

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.170 
ratio so we have to switch to something
else<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.450> sweet<00:00:40.320> X<00:00:40.559> sweet<00:00:41.219> x<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.030> high

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
else like sweet X sweet x is a high

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.569 
else like sweet X sweet x is a high
ratio<00:00:42.420> product<00:00:43.050> sweet<00:00:43.710> X<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.340> being

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
ratio product sweet X is now being

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
ratio product sweet X is now being
