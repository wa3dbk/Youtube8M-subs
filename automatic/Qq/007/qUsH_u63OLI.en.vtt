00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.600
 under the motto jamaica said 'no to the nuclear cemetery' about two hundred 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.869
 people have supported the march on foot convened by the basin platform 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.899
 the arguments to oppose that the future depends on the region say the 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.300
 protesters are blunt is a woman 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.259
 the one that the hostels in a nuclear graveyard activity can harm and 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.520
 much the future of the interests of our city and that can create as 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.249
 much 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.249
 oo of 15 to 20 jobs inside villar de caÃ±as 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.160
 tepco is opposed to the jobs that it can destroy against 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.250
 productive fabric that was destroyed this region as a volunteer 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.390
 before the base alignment was in good health 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.540
 there is a debate open to the totality of the participating students 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 festive atmosphere of this mark of more than six kilometers from the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.280
 organization of the opposite case 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640
 both the mayor 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.299
 besides undemocratic 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.129
 is supposed to impose a false percent solution and try to make 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.900
 believe that somewhere is necessary and not only are we against it 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.280
 locate nowhere directly manifest our position before 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.650
 state 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.370
 as it assumes that a natural province wants to become a 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.820
 principle none 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 this story in this aspect 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 some close coaches from a grilled basin or villares del saz 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.750
 We consider that 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.610
 it is an aggression against 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.730
 It's not ours 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 the feeling of disorder 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.950
 environmental organizations for the local was mounted this march that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 bet on the energies 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.310
 necessary 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.310
 we had never forgotten aonuma hundred 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.799
 there are many ways to grow we know that this area is as it is but not 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.090
 we believe that in no way will the nuclear warehouse be what I'm going to lift 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 this area the opposite the anti-gravity platform considers very 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.030
 positive the follow-up of this march and prepares already an upcoming demonstration
