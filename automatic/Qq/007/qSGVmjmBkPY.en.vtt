00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.340
Where should I admire tonight’s moon?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.080
The sacred lights extinguish, revealing the feast

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:25.820
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone a mystery

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:06.880
“Zoburi, zoburi”, is this the sound made when eating something? “Zoburi, zoburi”

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:23.460
“Koriri, koriri”, is the sound made when chewing bones; “Koriri, koriri”

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.380
In a pitch-black

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.120
Night I ran along a narrow path; where’s that person?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.380
Under the moonlit

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.940
The path splits into other directions; that person won’t ever come back

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.460
Where should I admire tonight’s moon? The sacred lights extinguish, revealing the feast

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.860
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone a mystery

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.400
Dancing, on this melting mountain, clapping the hands in the moonlit night

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.900
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone an illusion

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:44.860
“Zururi, zururi” is this a sound of something crawling? “Zururi, zuriri”

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.400
In a pitch dark

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.020
Night I run as fast as I can, desperately

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.440
With the bow

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.840
Ready, lost in a transient world where that person won’t come back

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.440
The light is breaking, piercing my body, yet nothing will change in my red eyes

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.820
Many times this mountain seemed to smile to everyone’s gold and silver spirit

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.440
Dancing, on this melting mountain, clapping the hands in the moonlit night

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.940
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone an illusion

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.460
Where should I admire tonight’s moon? The sacred lights extinguish, revealing the feast

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.120
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone a mystery

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.400
The light is breaking, piercing my body, yet nothing will change in my red eyes

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.840
Many times this mountain seemed to smile to everyone’s gold and silver spirit

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:41.460
Dancing, on this melting mountain, clapping the hands in the moonlit night

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.800
Since there aren’t jars nor sake cups, how they got drunk is for everyone an illusion

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.960
It’s the moon of a distant land
