00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.730
 so Hello everyone today March 25 means 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.429
 main rossom 708 exactly three weeks of us 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 summarize 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 so today we have a maximum weight of 70 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:26.150
 gram 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.150
 Well, the minimum 350 grams three pieces 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:37.920
 very uneven grow in bondage 500 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 last year in three weeks was 607 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 the center of this oil is level che 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.660
 dew 708 clearly 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 but then more stable lips were more 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 even weight was in such a difference in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 two times almost so many chicks are not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 it could not be apparently 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 maybe this party is defective 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:11.119
 most likely what i have yesterday 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.750
 I was at sea fishing I caught a bull 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.750
 It means I had no cola. 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.420
 had it means in a meat grinder because 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 that the bones on the head large grind 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 in a meat grinder 10 minutes cook porridge 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.730
 add make porridge start add 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.610
 grain mixture here is not the morning film and then 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:50.220
 means grass 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:58.920
 sliced ​​eggs 3 eggs are such porridge 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 get together often I was with me today 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.640
 the last day of it is eating up the sun 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.149
 feed bag I bought means this here 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 50 broilers raised and yet I 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.250
 in two weeks will be 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.080
 broken brown significant halfbag 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.080
 to lift up to 20 days 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.180
 then this fish is the second day today 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:54.090
 fish is not much to see more than on the neck 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:55.110
 it flies right here but 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.500
 follow to not for 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.190
 This is what to do with them to start others 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.100
 bullets or pull because if the whole 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.079
 fish is such a thing warm 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.200
 so that they do not poison where the bullets 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.209
 feeder need to watch 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.459
 but they love very much this she would now I 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.459
 I do love this business 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.560
 here is the germinated grain 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:33.860
 hard I have already moved really big pro 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:49.129
 elk probably also leave autumn behind 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:04:02.829
 love so far 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:04:10.609
 I have the results with this 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:17.479
 such a thing here I grow new 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:19.519
 grape varieties are green as factory 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.530
 how much is it worth here goes but she 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.570
 Why, but they need it important to 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.750
 the roots have developed and take away the leaves here 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.870
 so tear off 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.099
 Here they are thrown is theirs favorite hobby 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.930
 This leaves from grapes directly not like 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:41.000
 But who first grasped the fact itself over 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:43.340
 they also love business from separately 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.360
 I will send separately just about any 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.260
 Kaas make sure 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:53.880
 also go very 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:54.720
 Now that's just a little bit here raid 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.860
 are watching 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.130
 that's it that there is no so-called everywhere 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.460
 experts shoot a video of what's in the roller and 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.590
 something different from others need something 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.760
 there almost there for some super 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.070
 the conditions here I can one hundred percent 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.100
 jump rollers are nothing at all 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.500
 differ from simple speech if with 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.070
 childhood teach feed feed 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.910
 such products have a very any 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.460
 practically 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:31.520
 I'll tell you yesterday I cleaned 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.870
 fishmen and inadvertently dropped guts cheese and 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.380
 Yashin drunk at the beginning they are this 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.760
 flew pulled up all these guts drill 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.680
 goby 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.050
 ate watch today 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.360
 nothing happened to them nothing this 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.700
 simple here they are more perfect 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.880
 stomach even what if a man since childhood 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.400
 teach and if of course feed one 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.860
 feed and then start giving 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.550
 mean there are some potatoes there 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.560
 marinated there but of course they have 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.940
 there will be problems later, and if since childhood 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.580
 since i'm some 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.760
 from the table objects are struggling not finished there 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:13.320
 do not brush the whale husks 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.680
 threw them all they ate and then they all eat 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.840
 fish and meat 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.100
 mission any everything they all thresh 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:27.030
 and everything's fine growing fine 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.949
 there is no trouble 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.260
 revealed normal 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:36.620
 so experiment what you have there 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:41.240
 eat because feed them feed 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.330
 and 1 is expensive and declining environmental sense 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.400
 all here are these chemical additives 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:54.680
 stimulants seem to me so that's better 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:58.790
 Here I am as a ponomar with supervision means 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.550
 that's 770 grams maximum average weight 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.760
 somewhere 720 730 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:10.479
 But from the average weight if so take it 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.479
 we are 21 years old three weeks exactly today 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:19.430
 then all is not the case is completed the following 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:20.510
 video four weeks after a week all 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.289
 good luck to all 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.289
 all the best
