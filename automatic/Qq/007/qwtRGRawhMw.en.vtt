me tap weapons and so let me show you
how<00:00:57.929> they<00:00:58.140> work<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.559> normally<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.010> tapping

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
how they work so normally you're tapping

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
how they work so normally you're tapping
and<00:00:59.399> holding<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.760> screen<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.089> this<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.659> if

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and holding the screen like this but if

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
and holding the screen like this but if
I<00:01:00.839> just<00:01:01.019> tap<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> screen<00:01:01.409> like<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> then

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I just tap on the screen like that then

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
I just tap on the screen like that then
I<00:01:02.519> also<00:01:02.699> shoot<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.780> we've<00:01:04.410> got<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> couple<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I also shoot and we've got a couple of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.700 
I also shoot and we've got a couple of
these<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.090> managed<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.960> yep

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
these so that we are managed to get yep

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
these so that we are managed to get yep
two<00:01:07.980> or<00:01:08.070> three<00:01:08.250> shots<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.090> then

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
two or three shots out of that and then

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.710 
two or three shots out of that and then
we<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> stay<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.470> keep<00:01:10.530> firing<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
we just stay there and keep firing and

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
we just stay there and keep firing and
it's<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.800> reason<00:01:13.980> it's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.970> know

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's so the reason it's not you know

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's so the reason it's not you know
your<00:01:15.510> traditional<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.260> of<00:01:16.380> shmup<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
your traditional kind of shmup is that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.180 
your traditional kind of shmup is that
effectively<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.010> hit

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
effectively you don't have to get hit

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.250 
effectively you don't have to get hit
like<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.550> ever<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.810> remove

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
like that ever because you just remove

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.470 
like that ever because you just remove
your<00:01:22.440> finger<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> screen<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.360> the

robot<00:01:30.840> owes<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.800> I've<00:01:31.890> got<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.040> destroy<00:01:32.370> these

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.140 
robot owes so I've got to destroy these
things<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.750> makes<00:01:33.900> movement

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
things but it's also it makes movement

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
things but it's also it makes movement
instantaneous<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.050> I'm<00:01:37.140> tapping<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
instantaneous right so I'm tapping and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.290 
instantaneous right so I'm tapping and
holding<00:01:37.800> but<00:01:38.190> if<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> move<00:01:38.820> quickly<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
holding but if I want to move quickly I

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.630 
holding but if I want to move quickly I
could<00:01:39.510> drag<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.410> hold<00:01:40.860> across<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.400> entire

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
could drag and hold across the entire

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
could drag and hold across the entire
think<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.210> move<00:01:42.510> in<00:01:42.780> select<00:01:43.110> remove

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
think I can just move in select remove

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.990 
think I can just move in select remove
my<00:01:43.920> finger<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> screen<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.760> put<00:01:44.910> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
my finger from the screen then put it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940 
my finger from the screen then put it
down<00:01:45.120> again<00:01:45.330> now<00:01:45.480> power<00:01:46.050> or<00:01:46.230> life<00:01:46.410> power<00:01:46.800> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
down again now power or life power I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
down again now power or life power I
think<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.550> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.730> go<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.030> better

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
think so we're going to go with better

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.680 
think so we're going to go with better
power<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:50.400> my<00:01:50.460> gun<00:01:50.700> tap<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.060> hold<00:01:51.150> there<00:01:51.450> and

right-hand corner there is a bit of a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.470 
right-hand corner there is a bit of a
timer<00:03:22.919> going<00:03:23.129> on<00:03:23.340> there<00:03:23.549> but<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.359> fact

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
timer going on there but I like the fact

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.500 
timer going on there but I like the fact
that<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:24.989> skip<00:03:25.260> past<00:03:26.180> those<00:03:27.180> beams

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that you can just skip past those beams

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.449 
that you can just skip past those beams
like<00:03:27.810> I'm<00:03:28.019> on<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> left<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.739> now<00:03:28.949> and<00:03:29.129> then

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.080 
got to shoot these wheels is a little
bit<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.650> robotic<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.130> Italy<00:04:11.459> sort<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.910> bit

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
bit like robotic in Italy sort of a bit

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.800 
bit like robotic in Italy sort of a bit
of<00:04:12.180> an<00:04:12.270> idiot<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.819> also<00:04:15.000> super

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
of an idiot and and also super

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.970 
of an idiot and and also super
over-the-top<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.410> I'm<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.739> avoid

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
over-the-top so I'm just going to avoid

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.650 
over-the-top so I'm just going to avoid
these<00:04:17.160> bullets<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.730> keep<00:04:17.850> firing<00:04:18.239> get

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
these bullets and just keep firing get

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.629 
these bullets and just keep firing get
rid<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.840> these<00:04:18.930> wheels<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:20.160> know<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> way<00:04:20.519> of

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
rid of these wheels you know the way of

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.370 
rid of these wheels you know the way of
that<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.389> there<00:04:21.510> are<00:04:21.600> these<00:04:21.690> boss<00:04:21.900> fights<00:04:22.200> as

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that so there are these boss fights as

well Bam Bam Bam just jumping over those
those<00:04:25.020> things<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.590> make<00:04:25.740> sure<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.919> think

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
those things it make sure you think

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.230 
those things it make sure you think
differently<00:04:26.490> for<00:04:26.669> somebody<00:04:26.940> who's<00:04:27.030> played

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
differently for somebody who's played

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.990 
differently for somebody who's played
fair<00:04:27.570> number<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.810> schmutz<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:29.130> forces<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:29.970> to

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
fair number of schmutz it forces you to

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.480 
fair number of schmutz it forces you to
think<00:04:30.090> differently<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.800> quite<00:04:32.100> like<00:04:32.250> backs

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
think differently and I quite like backs

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.400 
think differently and I quite like backs
there<00:04:32.790> are<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.210> know<00:04:33.300> schemata<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:34.230> quite

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
there are you know schemata it's quite

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.140 
there are you know schemata it's quite
easy<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.830> them<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:34.950> get<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.310> little<00:04:35.700> bit<00:04:35.910> tiring

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
easy for them to get a little bit tiring

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.600 
easy for them to get a little bit tiring
a<00:04:36.270> little<00:04:36.300> bit<00:04:36.510> boring<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:38.430> is

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610
