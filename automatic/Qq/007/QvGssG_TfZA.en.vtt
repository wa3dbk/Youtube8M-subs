00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
get inside our box here looks like we

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
get inside our box here looks like we
have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.789> tab<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> cut<00:00:52.610> designed

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
have a little tab here to cut designed

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
have a little tab here to cut designed
by<00:00:53.730> Apple<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.239> California<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.170> inside<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.980> our

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
by Apple in California and inside is our

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000 
by Apple in California and inside is our
time<00:00:56.370> capsule<00:00:56.629> lips<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.890> going

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
time capsule lips right up we're going

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.139 
time capsule lips right up we're going
to<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> look<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> minute

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to take a look at this in just a minute

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
to take a look at this in just a minute
but<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.449> let's<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.440> inside

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but first let's see what we get inside

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
but first let's see what we get inside
the<00:01:01.920> box<00:01:01.949> besides<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> time<00:01:02.820> capsule<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.780> we

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the box besides the time capsule so we

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.990 
the box besides the time capsule so we
have<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> power<00:01:04.290> cord<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.400> course<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> time

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
have a power cord and of course the time

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640 
have a power cord and of course the time
capsule<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.600> internal<00:01:06.990> power<00:01:07.110> supply<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
capsule has an internal power supply so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
capsule has an internal power supply so
there<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> no<00:01:08.189> external<00:01:08.970> power<00:01:09.299> supply<00:01:09.600> here

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the bottom of the time capsule is a very

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
the bottom of the time capsule is a very
grippy<00:01:54.689> rubber<00:01:54.720> foot<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> deep<00:01:56.009> notch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
grippy rubber foot with a deep notch

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
grippy rubber foot with a deep notch
around<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> side<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.600> allows<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.320> time

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
around the side this allows the time

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
around the side this allows the time

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that notch on the side so you can see if

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.789 
that notch on the side so you can see if
you<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.210> closely<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.439> sort<00:02:04.649> of

disappears under the top of the time

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
disappears under the top of the time
capsule<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> hidden<00:02:08.129> vent<00:02:08.550> in

capsule and there is a hidden vent in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
capsule and there is a hidden vent in
there<00:02:08.910> which<00:02:09.360> allows<00:02:09.569> time<00:02:09.869> capsule<00:02:10.200> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
there which allows time capsule to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.300 
there which allows time capsule to
breathe<00:02:10.440> that's<00:02:10.649> important<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
breathe that's important because the

breathe that's important because the
time<00:02:11.489> capsule<00:02:11.849> contains<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.330> hard<00:02:12.540> drive

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
time capsule contains a hard drive

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
and an internal power supply so it needs

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.490 
and an internal power supply so it needs

do<00:03:26.129> is<00:03:26.370> select<00:03:26.699> update<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.449> the<00:03:27.569> time<00:03:27.750> capsule

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
do is select update and the time capsule

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.599 
do is select update and the time capsule
will<00:03:28.290> restart<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:28.980> apply<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.430> changes<00:03:31.609> once

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609

in<00:03:49.319> my<00:03:49.769> case<00:03:50.010> I'm<00:03:50.160> backing<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.579> nearly<00:03:50.940> one<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
in my case I'm backing up nearly one and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180 
in my case I'm backing up nearly one and
a<00:03:51.449> half<00:03:51.599> terabytes<00:03:52.199> so<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:52.799> going<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:52.980> take

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
a half terabytes so it's going to take

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.939 
a half terabytes so it's going to take
about<00:03:53.310> two<00:03:53.699> days<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.419> this<00:03:54.599> wirelessly<00:03:55.319> now

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
about two days to do this wirelessly now

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.530 
about two days to do this wirelessly now
it's<00:03:56.069> much<00:03:56.220> faster<00:03:56.669> if<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.819> time<00:03:57.030> capsule<00:03:57.389> was

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it's much faster if the time capsule was

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.349 
it's much faster if the time capsule was
directly<00:03:58.139> connected<00:03:58.409> via<00:03:58.949> USB<00:03:59.430> or<00:03:59.579> Ethernet
