00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey guys happy Brian here with an update

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.059 
hey guys happy Brian here with an update
on<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.470> sprinting<00:00:04.670> situation<00:00:06.620> some<00:00:07.620> people

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
on the sprinting situation some people

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.700 
on the sprinting situation some people
brought<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.519> attention<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:09.210> if<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.320> jump

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
brought to my attention that if you jump

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.629 
brought to my attention that if you jump
on<00:00:12.320> trapdoors<00:00:13.320> Bell<00:00:13.590> sprinting<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> roof

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
on trapdoors Bell sprinting with a roof

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:24.279 
on trapdoors Bell sprinting with a roof
you<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> lot<00:00:16.049> faster<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> that's<00:00:21.830> okay<00:00:22.830> um

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
you go a lot faster so that's okay um

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.410 
you go a lot faster so that's okay um
works<00:00:25.289> fairly<00:00:26.010> well<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
works fairly well but now if you do it

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.630 
works fairly well but now if you do it
with<00:00:27.630> trap<00:00:27.990> doors<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.599> faster

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
with trap doors you go a lot faster

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.740 
with trap doors you go a lot faster
almost<00:00:32.640> twice<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:32.969> fast<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:35.090> as<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.510> here

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
almost twice as fast so as you can here

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
almost twice as fast so as you can here
too<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.500> sounds<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.219> still<00:00:38.460> walking<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
too it sounds like I'm still walking on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.080 
too it sounds like I'm still walking on
the<00:00:39.030> dirt<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.260> i<00:00:40.350> am

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
the dirt and that's kind of because i am

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.319 
the dirt and that's kind of because i am
trapdoors<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.690> 1.8<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.829> bugged<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
trapdoors in 1.8 got bugged i think it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
trapdoors in 1.8 got bugged i think it
is<00:00:45.360> where<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:49.250> they

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
is where they don't have like a they

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.590 
is where they don't have like a they
have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> collision<00:00:50.730> mass<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.449> don't

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
have a collision mass but they don't

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
have a collision mass but they don't
have<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.829> texture<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.449> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
have like texture to them so what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.910 
have like texture to them so what
happens<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.440> you're<00:00:55.559> walking<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
happens is when you're walking on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
happens is when you're walking on
trapdoors<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.820> bumped<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.750> eighth<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
trapdoors you get bumped up an eighth of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.849 
trapdoors you get bumped up an eighth of
a<00:00:58.170> block<00:00:58.879> but<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:01.079> you're<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.649> touching

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
a block but like you're still touching

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.759 
a block but like you're still touching
the<00:01:02.160> block<00:01:02.370> below<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> fact<00:01:04.619> you're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the block below you so in fact you're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
the block below you so in fact you're
just<00:01:04.920> making<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.280> block<00:01:05.460> taller<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just making that block taller now this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.190 
just making that block taller now this
affects<00:01:07.049> also<00:01:07.799> stacks<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.340> ice<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:10.140> do

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
affects also stacks with ice so if i do

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
affects also stacks with ice so if i do
this<00:01:10.549> normally<00:01:11.780> with<00:01:12.780> ice<00:01:14.119> very<00:01:15.119> fast<00:01:15.600> past

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this normally with ice very fast past

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.240 
this normally with ice very fast past
stuff<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> minecart<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:19.250> even

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
stuff the minecart now if i go back even

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.240 
stuff the minecart now if i go back even
faster<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:23.509> if<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.009> works

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
faster so if you put or how this works

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
faster so if you put or how this works
though<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.759> when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> hit<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> ceiling<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
though is when you hit the ceiling it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
though is when you hit the ceiling it
resets<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.890> jump<00:01:29.220> timer<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.610> you've<00:01:32.610> jumped

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
resets your jump timer and you've jumped

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
resets your jump timer and you've jumped
four<00:01:33.150> blocks<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> time<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.020> sprinting<00:01:34.290> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
four blocks at a time when sprinting so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.230 
four blocks at a time when sprinting so
that<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.909> gives<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.390> speed<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> when

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that just gives you more speed so when

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.560 
that just gives you more speed so when
you<00:01:39.920> start<00:01:40.920> hitting<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> ceiling<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.270> resets

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you start hitting the ceiling it resets

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.010 
you start hitting the ceiling it resets
your<00:01:42.659> timer<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.840> get<00:01:45.840> another

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
your timer and you can get another

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
your timer and you can get another
forward<00:01:46.680> blocks<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.579> space<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.689> trap

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
forward blocks of space in with trap

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
forward blocks of space in with trap
doors<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.530> puts<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.890> slightly<00:01:50.759> closer<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
doors it puts you slightly closer to the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.310 
doors it puts you slightly closer to the
ceiling<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.880> less<00:01:54.329> jump<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
ceiling and you have less jump time and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
ceiling and you have less jump time and
you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> still<00:01:55.920> fit<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:57.170> with<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.670> one<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you can still fit in this with a one and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
you can still fit in this with a one and
half<00:02:00.930> ceiling<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.009> there<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.090> two

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
half ceiling there there with the two

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
half ceiling there there with the two
high<00:02:03.390> ceiling<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.229> trap<00:02:04.560> doors<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.040> best

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
high ceiling so trap doors are the best

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.750 
high ceiling so trap doors are the best
possible<00:02:05.369> option<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
possible option for this

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.220 
possible option for this
and<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.090> give<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.570> lot<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.900> extra

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and they do give you a lot of extra

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.330 
and they do give you a lot of extra
speed<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> bug<00:02:13.990> obviously<00:02:14.650> though<00:02:14.830> for

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
speed this is a bug obviously though for

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.150 
speed this is a bug obviously though for
those<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:16.120> wondering<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:18.010> not

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
those of you that are wondering I'm not

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.700 
those of you that are wondering I'm not
really<00:02:18.280> sure<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.040> entirely<00:02:21.910> an

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
really sure like if it was entirely an

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.160 
really sure like if it was entirely an
accident<00:02:23.710> or<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:24.310> slightly<00:02:25.170> intentional

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
accident or if it's slightly intentional

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
accident or if it's slightly intentional
like<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.650> hitting<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> ceiling<00:02:27.250> would

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
like if hitting the ceiling would

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.290 
like if hitting the ceiling would
restart<00:02:28.600> your<00:02:28.750> jump<00:02:28.990> timer<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:30.400> don't<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.180> how

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
restart your jump timer I don't see how

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.970 
restart your jump timer I don't see how
they<00:02:31.450> could<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.080> an<00:02:32.260> accident<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.860> be
