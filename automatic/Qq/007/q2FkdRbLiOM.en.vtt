kind of cool you can also change the
dimensions<00:02:09.270> um<00:02:09.509> see<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.319> much<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.830> scrunched

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
dimensions um see how much it scrunched

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.760 
dimensions um see how much it scrunched
if<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.330> less<00:02:12.569> pixels

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
if it's less pixels

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.050 
if it's less pixels
and<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.040> spreads<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.400> more<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.910> more

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and it spreads out more if it's more

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
and it spreads out more if it's more
pixels<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.200> was<00:02:19.230> about<00:02:19.380> ten<00:02:19.740> twenty

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
pixels I think it was about ten twenty

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.290 
pixels I think it was about ten twenty
five<00:02:20.130> maybe<00:02:24.080> yeah<00:02:25.080> okay<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:27.000> also<00:02:27.120> change

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
five maybe yeah okay you can also change

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
would fix also I think in the free

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.380 
would fix also I think in the free
version<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.520> should<00:03:47.670> be<00:03:47.760> able<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.970> lock<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
version you should be able to lock the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.020 
version you should be able to lock the
dateline<00:03:48.660> position<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.850> you're<00:03:50.970> not

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
across the screen because it does take a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.140 
across the screen because it does take a
while<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.740> put<00:03:55.830> back<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.820> little<00:03:57.060> bit

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
while to put back it's a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.540 
while to put back it's a little bit
laggy<00:03:57.300> which<00:03:57.750> I'm<00:03:57.930> not<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.110> huge<00:03:58.320> fan<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.590> but

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
laggy which I'm not a huge fan of but

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.750 
laggy which I'm not a huge fan of but
you<00:03:59.880> can't<00:04:00.120> really<00:04:00.270> complain<00:04:00.600> um<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:02.610> can

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
you can't really complain um you can

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.430 
you can't really complain um you can
also<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> display<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> center<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
also have a display in the center of the
