00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it's good to have a ton in shame and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
it's good to have a ton in shame and
especially<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.579> bulky<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
especially if it's bulky so I go for the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
especially if it's bulky so I go for the
Stealth<00:00:46.649> Rock<00:00:46.800> he<00:00:47.160> goes<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.510> seed<00:00:48.750> flare

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
Stealth Rock he goes for the seed flare

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.439 
Stealth Rock he goes for the seed flare
and<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.950> still<00:00:50.250> doesn't<00:00:50.460> bring<00:00:50.730> me<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.059> sesh

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and it still doesn't bring me to my sesh

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
and it still doesn't bring me to my sesh
so<00:00:51.690> i<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> stone<00:00:52.649> edge<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.370> some

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so i go for the stone edge to get some

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
so i go for the stone edge to get some
damage<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> point<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.590> his

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
damage and at this point i see his

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
damage and at this point i see his
defensive<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.730> stone<00:00:57.510> edge<00:00:57.719> doesn't<00:00:58.079> do

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
defensive because stone edge doesn't do

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.610 
defensive because stone edge doesn't do
 so<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.760> into<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.059> ape<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.719> my<00:01:01.199> ape<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
 so now go into my ape and my ape is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.090 
 so now go into my ape and my ape is
banded<00:01:02.100> i<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.550> yeah<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> he<00:01:04.530> goes<00:01:04.680> into

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
banded i think yeah so and he goes into

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.490 
banded i think yeah so and he goes into
vapeur<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> u-turn<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
vapeur and then i go for the u-turn and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.130 
vapeur and then i go for the u-turn and
this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> great<00:01:08.580> i<00:01:08.970> guess<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.420> i<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> my

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this is great i guess so i go to my

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.070 
this is great i guess so i go to my
father<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.820> star<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.810> star

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
me a scarf so he goes for a protect

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600 
me a scarf so he goes for a protect
which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.590> move<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.369> i<00:01:17.460> was

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
which is a nice move and i was

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
which is a nice move and i was
predicting<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> switch<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:18.930> went<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
predicting a switch so i went for a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.850 
predicting a switch so i went for a
hydro<00:01:19.860> pump<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.420> i<00:01:21.869> doubt<00:01:22.350> i<00:01:22.560> don't

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
hydro pump and here I i doubt i don't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.940 
hydro pump and here I i doubt i don't
want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.610> toxic<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.750> any<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.259> pokemon

want to get a toxic on any of my pokemon

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
want to get a toxic on any of my pokemon
so<00:01:26.159> i<00:01:26.189> decided<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> stay<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.570> he<00:01:28.049> actually

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
so i decided to stay in and he actually

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
so i decided to stay in and he actually
misses<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> talks<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.909> he<00:01:30.390> will

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
misses the talks and I know he will

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.469 
misses the talks and I know he will
switch<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:31.049> Shaymin<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.180> go

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
switch into Shaymin right here so I go

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
switch into Shaymin right here so I go
into<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:34.650> Jan<00:01:34.979> myself<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.150> he

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
into my other by Jan myself and now he

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
into my other by Jan myself and now he
switches<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.049> frozen<00:01:37.439> hell<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.909> didn't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
switches into frozen hell and I didn't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
switches into frozen hell and I didn't
predict<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.040> i<00:01:41.070> was

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
predict that the way I don't know i was

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.149 
predict that the way I don't know i was
i<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:42.299> maybe<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.200> trying<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> tell<00:01:43.950> me<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
i was maybe I was trying to tell me that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.910 
i was maybe I was trying to tell me that
to<00:01:44.640> tell<00:01:44.880> him<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> don't<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.920> any

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to tell him that I don't have any

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.219 
to tell him that I don't have any
attacks<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.759> hit<00:01:48.000> him<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
attacks that can hit him so I go for the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
attacks that can hit him so I go for the
nasty<00:01:49.619> plot<00:01:49.770> predicting<00:01:50.280> either<00:01:50.659> protect<00:01:51.659> or

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
nasty plot predicting either protect or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.620 
nasty plot predicting either protect or
toxic<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:53.220> goes<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.700> toxic<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
toxic and he goes for a toxic which is a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
toxic and he goes for a toxic which is a
fine<00:01:55.590> i<00:01:55.619> guess<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:57.119> server<00:01:57.750> by<00:01:57.899> jen

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
fine i guess because my server by jen

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
fine i guess because my server by jen
has<00:01:58.350> expert<00:01:58.860> belt<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.430> he<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.930> didn't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
has expert belt so he does he didn't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
has expert belt so he does he didn't
think<00:02:01.469> i<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.770> grass<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.610> have

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
think i have grass not but i have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
think i have grass not but i have
crashed<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> crass<00:02:04.860> not
