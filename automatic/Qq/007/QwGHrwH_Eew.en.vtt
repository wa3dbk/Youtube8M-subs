00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.590
 that is, there is still a chance to lunge they already have 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 chickens which costs about 20 keys but it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.380
 on average they are worth these wings 10 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.729
 keys 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.729

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.800
