00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
mostly most of the noise is actually my

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:22.410 
mostly most of the noise is actually my
fingers<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.070> air<00:02:12.100> play<00:02:12.570> my<00:02:13.570> finger<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
fingers in the air play my finger and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.790 
fingers in the air play my finger and
that's<00:02:22.600> about<00:02:22.840> half<00:02:23.080> throttle<00:02:23.290> only<00:02:23.620> buzz

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
that's about half throttle only buzz

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.180 
that's about half throttle only buzz
these<00:02:24.580> are<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:24.970> brilliant<00:02:25.300> limits

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
these are going to be brilliant limits

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.420 
these are going to be brilliant limits

something about this in a stinger 64

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.130 
something about this in a stinger 64
will<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.790> brilliant<00:02:31.209> brilliant<00:02:31.630> power

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
will be a brilliant brilliant power

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.380 
will be a brilliant brilliant power
