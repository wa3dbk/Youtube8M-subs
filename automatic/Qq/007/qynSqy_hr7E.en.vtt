alright now we've moved over to what's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.330 
alright now we've moved over to what's
called<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> laminar<00:00:10.200> flow<00:00:10.280> seriously<00:00:11.280> you

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
called the laminar flow seriously you

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.860 
called the laminar flow seriously you
guys<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.610> tell<00:00:11.790> me<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.300> yeah

powerline starting a little confusing
for<00:00:16.500> customers<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.460> refer<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> em<00:00:17.970> as

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.220 
for customers so we just refer to em as
laminar<00:00:18.420> flow<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:18.840> still<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.140> their

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
laminar flow but they still have their

the bottom is our Pro Series that
started<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> race<00:00:24.000> muffler

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
started out as a race muffler

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
started out as a race muffler
we've<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.320> multiple<00:00:25.500> sizes<00:00:26.039> pipe<00:00:26.880> sizes<00:00:27.240> are

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
we've got multiple sizes pipe sizes are

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.640 
we've got multiple sizes pipe sizes are
from<00:00:27.510> three<00:00:27.750> inch<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.080> way<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.410> five<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
from three inch all the way up to five a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.230 
from three inch all the way up to five a
lot<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.490> look<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.820> good<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
lot of they look really good on the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.540 
lot of they look really good on the
turbo<00:00:30.480> diesel<00:00:30.779> trucks<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.890> again<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.460> our

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
turbo diesel trucks and again it's our

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
turbo diesel trucks and again it's our
laminar<00:00:32.940> flow<00:00:33.149> design<00:00:33.329> where<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.110> uses<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
laminar flow design where it uses the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
laminar flow design where it uses the
two<00:00:35.219> perforated<00:00:35.940> cones<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> inside<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
two perforated cones on the inside to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
two perforated cones on the inside to
cancel<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.680> sound<00:00:37.950> frequencies<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
cancel out sound frequencies and it's a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.190 
cancel out sound frequencies and it's a
similar<00:00:39.149> fashion<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> chambered

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
similar fashion as with the chambered

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600 
similar fashion as with the chambered
mufflers<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.010> directs<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> sound

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
mufflers it directs the sound

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
mufflers it directs the sound
frequencies<00:00:42.149> into<00:00:42.360> themselves<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.960> cancel

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
frequencies into themselves they cancel

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.779 
frequencies into themselves they cancel
themselves<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
themselves out and you get that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.040 
themselves out and you get that
performance<00:00:45.059> increase<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
performance increase of it because of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440 
performance increase of it because of
the<00:00:46.110> scavenging<00:00:46.620> effect<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.910> tend<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the scavenging effect these do tend to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
the scavenging effect these do tend to
have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> unique<00:00:49.500> tone

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
have a little bit more of a unique tone

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
have a little bit more of a unique tone
to<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> thermal

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to them because we have a thermal

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750 
to them because we have a thermal
blanket<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> outside<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.460> help<00:00:53.640> keep

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
blanket up on the outside to help keep

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.569 
blanket up on the outside to help keep
the<00:00:53.940> shell<00:00:54.180> cool<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.140> does<00:00:55.350> soak<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.100> some

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the shell cool that does soak up some

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
the shell cool that does soak up some
sound<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
sound so they have a little bit more of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
sound so they have a little bit more of
a<00:00:58.680> nostalgic<00:00:59.309> sound<00:01:00.239> too<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.809> more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
a nostalgic sound too a little bit more

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
a nostalgic sound too a little bit more
of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> wrap<00:01:01.350> Ito<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> raspy<00:01:02.489> tinny

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of a wrap Ito now that the raspy tinny

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.189 
of a wrap Ito now that the raspy tinny
sound<00:01:02.850> we're<00:01:03.239> known<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> muscle<00:01:04.049> car

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
sound we're known for the muscle car

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
sound we're known for the muscle car
sound<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> chambered<00:01:05.010> mufflers<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
sound with the chambered mufflers so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.950 
sound with the chambered mufflers so
it's<00:01:05.939> another<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.360> option<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's another good option for the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
it's another good option for the
customer<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> said<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.000> works<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> lot
