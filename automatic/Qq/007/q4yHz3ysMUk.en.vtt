00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
was wanting to perhaps build a pond for
a<00:01:44.970> goldfish<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.770> probably<00:01:47.040> want<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
a goldfish they would probably want to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.649 
a goldfish they would probably want to
put<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> place<00:01:48.149> where<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.570> get

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
put it in a place where it can get

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.679 
put it in a place where it can get
plenty<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> sunshine<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.450> would

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
plenty of sunshine and that that would

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
plenty of sunshine and that that would
certainly<00:01:51.930> help<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.280> summertime

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
certainly help in them in the summertime

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
certainly help in them in the summertime
and<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.479> winter<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.740> keep

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and the winter time if they go keep

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.050 
and the winter time if they go keep
their<00:01:56.040> fish<00:01:56.189> healthy<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.700> gonna<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
their fish healthy they're gonna have to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.130 
their fish healthy they're gonna have to
have<00:01:57.210> they're<00:01:57.450> gonna<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> keep<00:01:57.840> good

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
have they're gonna have to keep good

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
have they're gonna have to keep good
water<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.829> mean<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.340> can't<00:01:59.490> let<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> water

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
water I mean they can't let the water

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
water I mean they can't let the water
get<00:02:00.030> stagnant<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.439> full<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.770> debris

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
get stagnant or you know full of debris

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.100 
get stagnant or you know full of debris
or<00:02:02.430> whatever<00:02:02.790> dirt<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.570> most<00:02:03.810> people

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
or whatever dirt I think most people

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
or whatever dirt I think most people
that<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.409> fish<00:02:04.890> pond<00:02:05.130> probably<00:02:05.729> probably

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that have a fish pond probably probably

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
that have a fish pond probably probably
would<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> filter<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> some<00:02:08.069> kind

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
would have a filter of some kind

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.430 
would have a filter of some kind
depending<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.119> their<00:02:09.330> size<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> pond<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
depending on their size of the pond and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
depending on their size of the pond and
it's<00:02:10.860> also<00:02:11.039> prettier<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> fish<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
it's also prettier to see the fish in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.050 
it's also prettier to see the fish in
the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.360 
the
clean<00:02:13.270> water<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.930> opposed<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> dirty<00:02:14.950> murky

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
clean water as opposed to dirty murky

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.720 
clean water as opposed to dirty murky
water<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.290> they'll<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:18.069> happier<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
water and they'll be happier and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.830 
water and they'll be happier and
prettier<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> live<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> lot<00:02:20.650> longer
