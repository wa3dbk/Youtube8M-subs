00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 khan on television more open than 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.899
 never and well, we have the theme of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.820
 day the arrival of reinforcements for the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.710
 america 2 already confirmed osvaldo 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
 martínez narciso mine what of the mace 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 Rodriguez, it's a matter of days for 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.590
 put it like that and not what is asked is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.180
 the quarry of the america that is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 happening around there it ends up saying a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.730
 young central who had already had 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 opportunities a pair of tournaments like 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 pimentel decide to go with more players 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.119
 experienced severity diego kings who 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.859
 happens there with America that boasts 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 many Christian titles in the sub-20 is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.140
 a reality 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 america in that aspect has worked well 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.579
 but it seems that they are not so willing 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.290
 like other teams to give them a role 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.090
 predominant to the homegrown players I do not want 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 say that there are not some who have 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 an important role to this jiménez king 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 there is diego kings but it seems that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 america first think about spending money 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.420
 that in giving opportunity to young people 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 it's not uncommon in the team of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.530
 eagles of america what do they serve 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.030
 championships in the U-20 category fits 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 remember that until the previous season 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 they got rid of a promise in the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 half court as it was julian and gallardo 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 that ended up going to the ray team 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 Necaxa this guy brought talent 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 got some goals even with the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.880
 sub-20 was one of the most players 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.840
 featured set with raúl alonso 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
 jiménez 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 the latter perhaps the most transcendent 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.060
 as for basic forces of the america 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 what they have announced this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 institution seems to me that raúl alonso 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 jiménez the case of diego kings and for 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.560
 supposedly the case of hugo gonzález that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.030
 he had good much of the ownership 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.649
 the previous season but there's an outside 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 where are the others where there are others 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.350
 elements of the sub-20 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.719
 at the end diego kings are going to go the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.729
 next summer to portugal to play with the 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.020
 port are going to recover again julian 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 and gallant that they will do with all their 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.409
 players who sacrificed that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 They demonstrated talent and that excited them 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.759
 the entire Americanist institution that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.860
 Sometimes it is not necessary to take out the portfolio and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.959
 put millions of dollars on the table 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.030
 it seems that quality is there but in the team 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.130
 the eagles of america are characterized 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.079
 not to give opportunity to the elements 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 from his quarry to his jewels I've never 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.649
 done and it seems to me that it's constant going 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.270
 to follow if it is a reality if 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.429
 there are homegrown in the first team of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 america but if one pulls out the list of 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.670
 that played more minutes the season 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 previous very few of his players 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.299
 Mexicans are born in the Americas 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.119
 starting from the goalkeeper that not from 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.599
 there we can pass for valenzuela there 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.799
 there are players like chema cárdenas 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.050
 other elements appear out there that go 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.760
 appearing as a mill that is also not 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
 and medina that has not emerged from the america 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.390
 then it seems that the america 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.730
 wants the only way out of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
 this losing streak of not winning titles as 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 is once again spending a lot of money myself 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.540
 I think you could do a good 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.800
 combination 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.120
 I hope America forgets that 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 there is indeed a lot of talent in your 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 quarry there is an interesting process that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.370
 he waits or who is developing those 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.660
 Ramírez as director of basic forces 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.240
 of the whole to the eagles of the america 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.320
 hopefully with the info with incorporation of 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.910
 this man who has been in a little while 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
 working just in that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.560
 department then little by little they leave 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.630
 seeing as precisely opportunity 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.980
 these elements canteranos of the equipment of 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.410
 the salle good for there is the theme 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:57.030
 america spending a lot of money the quarry 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:01.470
 leaving a little bit of the information in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.990
 twitter chain 37 to our channel 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.520
 youtube chain three reinforcements and enjoy 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.640
 of the videos that you are interested in 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.640
