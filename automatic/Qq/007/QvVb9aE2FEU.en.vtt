to find what I thought was good enough
to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.919> but<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> was<00:00:08.790> setting<00:00:09.000> up

to make a video on but I was setting up
for<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> mod<00:00:09.360> review<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:09.960> went<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
for a mod review and I went to the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.810 
for a mod review and I went to the
nether<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.710> spawned<00:00:10.950> right<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.370> fortress

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820

nether and I spawned right in a fortress
and<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.269> actually<00:00:12.540> never<00:00:12.660> happened<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and that has actually never happened to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.299 
and that has actually never happened to
me<00:00:13.200> before<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> was<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:13.980> has<00:00:14.099> got<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
me before so I was like this has got to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.860 
me before so I was like this has got to
be<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.460> awesome<00:00:14.759> seed<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> checked<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> out

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
be an awesome seed so I checked it out

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.269 
be an awesome seed so I checked it out
there<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.350> much<00:00:16.529> cool<00:00:16.710> stuff<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.070> thought<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
there was so much cool stuff I thought I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.620

had to make a video on it it was

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.910 
had to make a video on it it was
probably<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> best<00:00:19.170> seed<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.710> ever

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
probably the best seed that I've ever

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
probably the best seed that I've ever
seen<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.789> I'm<00:00:20.880> gonna<00:00:20.970> go<00:00:21.119> over<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> cool

right<00:01:16.799> inside<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> fortress<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> do

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
right inside the fortress if you do

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
right inside the fortress if you do
build<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.320> it'll<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
build it right over there it'll just be

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.260 
build it right over there it'll just be
a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.220> away<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> fortress<00:01:21.150> but

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
a little bit away from the fortress but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.460 
a little bit away from the fortress but
it's<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.540> cooler<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.229> spawn

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's much cooler to actually spawn

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
it's much cooler to actually spawn
inside<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> fortress<00:01:23.549> itself<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.780> yeah<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
inside the fortress itself so yeah it's

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
inside the fortress itself so yeah it's
a<00:01:25.140> huge<00:01:25.530> fortress<00:01:26.040> by<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> way<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
a huge fortress by the way I mean this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
a huge fortress by the way I mean this
is<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.229> massive<00:01:28.470> fortress<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
is actually a really massive fortress it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
is actually a really massive fortress it
goes<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.150> also<00:01:30.329> goes<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.810> way

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
goes that way and it also goes this way

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319 
goes that way and it also goes this way
as<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> ton<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> explore<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
as well so it's like a ton to explore I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
as well so it's like a ton to explore I
only<00:01:33.659> found<00:01:33.840> 3<00:01:34.140> blaze<00:01:34.380> spawner<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.009> there

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
only found 3 blaze spawner but there

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
only found 3 blaze spawner but there
could<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.310> many<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.390> hard

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
could be many more it's just really hard

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.109 
could be many more it's just really hard
to<00:01:36.689> navigate<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:37.170> places<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.590> least<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.890> me

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
to navigate these places at least for me

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.789 
to navigate these places at least for me
so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> first<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.079> right<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.380> there's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so the first one is right here there's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
so the first one is right here there's
one<00:01:40.920> place<00:01:41.189> spawned<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.350> you'll

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
one place spawned right here and you'll

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.210 
one place spawned right here and you'll
see<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> they're<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.799> completely

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
see that they're all completely

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
see that they're all completely
different<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> second<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
different go to the second one this is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.389 
different go to the second one this is
the<00:01:45.780> second<00:01:46.229> blaze<00:01:46.380> spawner<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the second blaze spawner right here and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
the second blaze spawner right here and
there<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> third<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.960> well<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
there is a third one as well and this is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.830 
there is a third one as well and this is
the<00:01:50.670> third<00:01:50.909> blaze<00:01:51.149> spawner<00:01:51.360> there<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:51.810> be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the third blaze spawner there could be

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
the third blaze spawner there could be
more<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.380> guys<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.130> something<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
more in guys if you see something that I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.920

comment and mention that I missed it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
because there could be like five for all

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.090 
because there could be like five for all
I<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.710> hard<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> go

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I know it's just really hard to go

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.620 
I know it's just really hard to go
through<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.399> whole<00:01:59.549> thing<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.390> fine

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
through the whole thing and to fine

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
through the whole thing and to fine
every<00:02:00.930> exact<00:02:01.229> location<00:02:02.030> some<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.210> stuff

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
every exact location some of this stuff

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
every exact location some of this stuff
is<00:02:03.570> actually<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.259> close<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> spawn<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
is actually really close to spawn but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
is actually really close to spawn but
other<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.759> further<00:02:06.090> away<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.570> it's

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
other a little bit further away but it's

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
other a little bit further away but it's
really<00:02:06.840> worth<00:02:07.020> showing<00:02:07.259> anyway<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
really worth showing anyway and this is
