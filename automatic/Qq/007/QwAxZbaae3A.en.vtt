00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
taken the center of my wire and I've

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
taken the center of my wire and I've
placed<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> end<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.730> ring<00:00:44.969> mandrel

placed it in the end of my ring mandrel

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
placed it in the end of my ring mandrel
and<00:00:45.480> started<00:00:45.989> wrapping<00:00:46.320> around<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.190> I'm

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and started wrapping around and I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
and started wrapping around and I'm
going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> keep<00:00:48.059> wrapping<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.809> round<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to keep wrapping this round and so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.580 
going to keep wrapping this round and so
I've<00:00:49.530> got<00:00:49.739> five<00:00:50.390> full<00:00:51.390> wraps<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.440> see

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I've got five full wraps and you can see

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
I've got five full wraps and you can see
one<00:00:52.860> wires<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> why<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
one wires going out one way on why it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380 
one wires going out one way on why it's
coming<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> other<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.920> five<00:00:56.390> full

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
coming the other way so it's five full

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
coming the other way so it's five full
circles<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.440> take<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.859> off<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
circles so if I take it off the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.380 
circles so if I take it off the
underside<00:01:00.329> looks<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:02.059> now<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
underside looks like that now this is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
underside looks like that now this is
where<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> need<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.049> finer<00:01:04.350> wire<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.430> what

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
where you need your finer wire and what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
where you need your finer wire and what
we're<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.540> start<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> wrap

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we're going to do is start now and wrap

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
we're going to do is start now and wrap
that<00:01:08.460> finer<00:01:08.909> wire<00:01:09.240> around<00:01:11.510> your<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.869> coils

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that finer wire around your your coils

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
that finer wire around your your coils
if<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.760> I've<00:01:15.180> gone<00:01:15.509> round<00:01:15.869> about

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
if you like and I've gone round about

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
if you like and I've gone round about
four<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:16.860> five<00:01:17.070> times<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.360> going

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
four or five times there but I'm going

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
four or five times there but I'm going
to<00:01:18.659> take<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.200> end<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> I've

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
to take that little end bit that I've

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.719 
to take that little end bit that I've
got<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:21.229> wrap<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.259> around<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.250> single

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
got and just wrap it around the single

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
got and just wrap it around the single
wire<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.600> off<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> left

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
wire can you see off there to the left

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
wire can you see off there to the left
I've<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> bound<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> around<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
I've just bound it around a couple of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
I've just bound it around a couple of
times<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.740> I'll<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.100> I'll<00:01:29.280> just

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
times and then what I'll do is I'll just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.719 
times and then what I'll do is I'll just
trim<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.790> off<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.540> nice<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.750> flat<00:01:31.729> puts

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
trim that off so it's nice and flat puts

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.120 
trim that off so it's nice and flat puts
the<00:01:33.210> circle<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:34.950> ring

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the circle all the way on your ring

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.940 
the circle all the way on your ring
mandrel<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.880> wrap<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.170> wires<00:01:37.409> around<00:01:37.829> I'm

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
mandrel and wrap the wires around I'm

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.170 
mandrel and wrap the wires around I'm
going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> show<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:38.790> lots<00:01:39.030> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
going to show you this from lots of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.539 
going to show you this from lots of
different<00:01:39.540> directions<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
different directions and then you can

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
different directions and then you can
take<00:01:41.939> those<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.750> wires<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.590> they've<00:01:43.890> come

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
take those two wires that they've come

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.550 
take those two wires that they've come
back<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> top<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.329> wrap<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.110> around<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
back to the top and wrap them around the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.310 
back to the top and wrap them around the
circle<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> upright<00:01:48.570> circle<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
circle as if that upright circle was a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
circle as if that upright circle was a
bead<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:50.520> were<00:01:50.909> working<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> same<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
bead we were working it the same way so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.340 
bead we were working it the same way so
you're<00:01:52.799> wrapping<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.079> full

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you're wrapping around just one full

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
you're wrapping around just one full
time<00:01:55.619> around

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
time around

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.150 
time around
so<00:01:57.720> those<00:01:58.020> rings<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.560> stood<00:01:58.800> up<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.040> can

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
so those rings are stood up we can

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.620 
so those rings are stood up we can
probably<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.610> better<00:01:59.790> from<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.240> picture

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
probably see it better from that picture

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.500 
probably see it better from that picture
it's<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.840> quite<00:02:01.230> good<00:02:01.410> one<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.510> once

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
it's not quite good one is that once

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.360 
it's not quite good one is that once
you've<00:02:03.750> wrapped<00:02:03.960> around<00:02:04.320> you'll<00:02:04.980> be<00:02:05.010> able<00:02:05.190> to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
you've wrapped around you'll be able to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.920 
you've wrapped around you'll be able to
slide<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.940> whole<00:02:06.120> thing<00:02:06.150> off<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> ring

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
slide the whole thing off the ring

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.950 
slide the whole thing off the ring
mandrel<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:08.790> using<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> pair<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.660> pliers

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
mandrel and then using a pair of pliers

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.290 
mandrel and then using a pair of pliers
just<00:02:10.860> carefully<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.460> hold<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> your

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
just carefully get a hold of one of your

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.200 
just carefully get a hold of one of your
ends<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.200> feed<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.160> around<00:02:14.550> or<00:02:14.820> through<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
ends and feed it around or through the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.320 
ends and feed it around or through the
shank<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:15.900> supporting<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.130> five<00:02:17.520> rings

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
shank now I'm supporting the five rings

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.140 
shank now I'm supporting the five rings
in<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:19.110> hand<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.520> wrapping<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> wire

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
in one hand and I'm wrapping the wire

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.590 
in one hand and I'm wrapping the wire
around<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.960> shank<00:02:22.610> trim<00:02:23.610> off<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.450> these

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
around the shank trim off with these

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080 
around the shank trim off with these
snips<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.260> close<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.280> I'm<00:02:26.940> only

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
snips as close as you can get I'm only

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.210 
snips as close as you can get I'm only
going<00:02:27.330> around<00:02:27.510> once<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> needs<00:02:28.470> wants<00:02:28.680> and

going around once on the needs wants and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 
going around once on the needs wants and
then<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:30.120> I'll<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.450> I'll<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.840> press

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
then what I'll do is I'll just press

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.310 
then what I'll do is I'll just press
that<00:02:31.410> down<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:31.980> pliers<00:02:32.840> onto<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.020> two

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that down with my pliers onto there two

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.150 
that down with my pliers onto there two
wires<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.860> are<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> ring<00:02:35.250> shank<00:02:36.470> okay<00:02:37.470> now

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
wires that are the ring shank okay now

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.560 
wires that are the ring shank okay now
I'm<00:02:38.220> gonna<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.430> exactly<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> same<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
I'm gonna do exactly the same with the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.070 
I'm gonna do exactly the same with the
other<00:02:39.780> side<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.290> I've<00:02:40.470> wrapped<00:02:40.860> around<00:02:41.130> once

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
other side so I've wrapped around once

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.510 
other side so I've wrapped around once
I'll<00:02:43.080> then<00:02:43.350> use<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:44.810> snips<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.260> I'll<00:02:47.040> trim

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I'll then use my snips and I'll trim

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'll then use my snips and I'll trim
that<00:02:47.730> off<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:48.090> close<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
that off as close as I can get it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.170 
that off as close as I can get it
remember<00:02:49.620> cut<00:02:50.160> size<00:02:50.400> always<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> outside

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
remember cut size always on the outside

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.690 
remember cut size always on the outside
of<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.840> ring<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.350> don't<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.890> cut<00:02:53.160> edge<00:02:53.370> on

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
of a ring you don't want a cut edge on

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.730 
of a ring you don't want a cut edge on
the<00:02:53.850> inside<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.600> ring<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.020> gonna<00:02:55.170> hurt<00:02:55.350> and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the inside of a ring it's gonna hurt and

then press that down with my pliers so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.090 
then press that down with my pliers so
what<00:03:00.300> you've<00:03:00.480> got<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.080> two<00:03:01.110> wires<00:03:01.860> going

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
what you've got is two wires going

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.720 
what you've got is two wires going
around<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> shank<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.739> then<00:03:04.739> these<00:03:04.950> sort<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
around the shank and then these sort of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.630 
around the shank and then these sort of
five<00:03:06.030> wires<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.959> top<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:08.100> wire<00:03:08.370> is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
five wires on the top and your wire is

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.060 
five wires on the top and your wire is
still<00:03:09.060> attached<00:03:09.510> your<00:03:09.780> fine<00:03:10.050> wire<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.920> only

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
still attached your fine wire we only

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.100 
still attached your fine wire we only
wrapped<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.489> round<00:03:11.519> one<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.060> that's<00:03:12.209> now<00:03:12.420> still

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
wrapped it round one so that's now still

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.160 
wrapped it round one so that's now still
attached<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.239> what<00:03:15.239> we're<00:03:15.390> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> do<00:03:15.900> now

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
attached so what we're going to do now

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.650 
attached so what we're going to do now
is<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.769> start<00:03:17.160> them<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.550> change<00:03:17.940> these<00:03:18.209> five

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
is to start them to change these five

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.280 
is to start them to change these five
loops<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:20.010> at<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.280> top<00:03:20.870> into<00:03:21.870> five

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
loops that we have at the top into five

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.810 
loops that we have at the top into five
petals<00:03:23.100> now<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.570> easiest<00:03:25.320> way<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.650> do<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.100> is

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
petals now the easiest way to do that is

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820 
petals now the easiest way to do that is
to<00:03:27.180> start<00:03:27.570> with<00:03:27.750> your<00:03:27.930> fingers<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.560> just

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
to start with your fingers and just

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.420 
to start with your fingers and just
gently<00:03:29.400> open<00:03:30.230> up

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
gently open up

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.270 
gently open up
the<00:03:32.939> little<00:03:33.239> rings<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.409> outside<00:03:34.829> too

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the little rings just the outside too

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.580 
the little rings just the outside too
the<00:03:35.640> others<00:03:35.909> will<00:03:36.030> splay<00:03:36.420> slightly<00:03:37.079> then<00:03:37.409> you

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the others will splay slightly then you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.309 
the others will splay slightly then you
can<00:03:37.739> get<00:03:37.920> your<00:03:38.129> pliers<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.170> a

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
can get your pliers and just one at a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.580 
can get your pliers and just one at a
time<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.099> can<00:03:41.180> bring<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.290> circle<00:03:43.590> down<00:03:44.180> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
time you can bring the circle down and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.420 
time you can bring the circle down and
then<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.519> see<00:03:47.700> now<00:03:47.909> that<00:03:47.939> one's<00:03:48.360> flats

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
then so you can see now that one's flats

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.860 
then so you can see now that one's flats
the<00:03:50.430> wires<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.939> we've<00:03:51.090> wrapped<00:03:51.299> around<00:03:51.540> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the wires that we've wrapped around the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.770 
the wires that we've wrapped around the
inside<00:03:52.319> have<00:03:52.680> gone<00:03:52.980> sort<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.519> slump<00:03:54.090> ways<00:03:54.329> kne

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
inside have gone sort of slump ways kne

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.259 
inside have gone sort of slump ways kne
karna<00:03:55.109> ways<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:55.470> don't<00:03:55.680> worry<00:03:55.799> about<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
karna ways but don't worry about that so

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.819 
karna ways but don't worry about that so
i've<00:03:57.390> then<00:03:57.569> taken<00:03:58.079> down<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.470> one<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.799> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
i've then taken down the one at the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.649 
i've then taken down the one at the
other<00:03:58.980> side<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:01.370> then<00:04:02.370> I'll<00:04:02.489> take<00:04:02.790> down<00:04:03.090> one

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
other side and then I'll take down one

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.259 
other side and then I'll take down one
of<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.930> next<00:04:04.290> ones<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.250> I'm<00:04:05.579> just<00:04:05.819> easing

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
of the next ones and I'm just easing

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.369 
of the next ones and I'm just easing
them<00:04:06.930> out<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.560> bringing<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.190> down<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.170> it

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
them out and bringing it down so that it

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.210 
them out and bringing it down so that it
lays<00:04:10.620> flat<00:04:12.139> now<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.200> see<00:04:13.409> how<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.769> one's<00:04:13.980> got

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
lays flat now you see how that one's got

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.649 
lays flat now you see how that one's got
a<00:04:14.250> little<00:04:14.579> bit<00:04:14.760> out<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.000> shape<00:04:15.150> because<00:04:15.450> I've

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
a little bit out of shape because I've

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.659 
a little bit out of shape because I've
given<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> bit<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.530> tug<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.070> little<00:04:17.100> bit<00:04:17.459> too

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
given it a bit of a tug a little bit too

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.240 
given it a bit of a tug a little bit too
hard<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.299> left<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.079> on<00:04:19.289> purpose<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.010> you

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
hard I left it on purpose so that you

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.939 
hard I left it on purpose so that you
could<00:04:20.430> see<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.180> then<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.510> get<00:04:21.780> my<00:04:21.959> next

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
could see that and then I get my next

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.460 
could see that and then I get my next
ring<00:04:23.220> in<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:24.389> I'm<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.660> gonna<00:04:24.960> shove<00:04:25.440> it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
ring in and then I'm just gonna shove it

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.339 
ring in and then I'm just gonna shove it
with<00:04:25.710> my<00:04:25.889> fingers<00:04:26.340> because<00:04:26.699> really<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.750> flower

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
with my fingers because really a flower

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.920 
with my fingers because really a flower
doesn't<00:04:28.770> have<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:29.460> perfectly<00:04:30.150> shaped<00:04:30.419> a

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
doesn't have to be perfectly shaped a

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.290 
doesn't have to be perfectly shaped a
flower<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:32.039> anything<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.580> be<00:04:32.699> a<00:04:32.729> flower<00:04:33.030> it

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
flower can be anything to be a flower it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.999 
flower can be anything to be a flower it
doesn't<00:04:33.599> need<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.810> perfect<00:04:34.110> circle's

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
doesn't need to be perfect circle's

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.490 
doesn't need to be perfect circle's
so<00:04:35.789> once<00:04:36.000> we've<00:04:36.240> got<00:04:36.270> them<00:04:36.599> all<00:04:36.750> flat<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.289> can

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
so once we've got them all flat I can

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.850 
so once we've got them all flat I can
start<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.310> shove<00:04:38.910> with<00:04:39.300> my<00:04:39.539> fingers<00:04:40.050> so

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
start then and shove with my fingers so

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.100 
start then and shove with my fingers so
that<00:04:41.099> I<00:04:41.220> sort<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.639> even<00:04:42.180> them<00:04:42.360> up<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.630> little<00:04:42.810> bit

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that I sort of even them up a little bit

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.860 
that I sort of even them up a little bit
because<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:44.070> don't<00:04:44.280> want<00:04:44.520> them<00:04:44.870> miss

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
because you don't want them miss

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.930 
because you don't want them miss
Sharon's<00:04:46.260> not<00:04:46.349> too<00:04:46.680> bad<00:04:46.919> but<00:04:47.130> uneven<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:47.820> know

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
Sharon's not too bad but uneven you know

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.560 
Sharon's not too bad but uneven you know
I<00:04:47.970> mean<00:04:48.349> so<00:04:49.349> now<00:04:49.620> I've<00:04:49.770> got<00:04:50.039> five<00:04:50.580> petals

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
I mean so now I've got five petals

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.649 
I mean so now I've got five petals
downwards<00:04:52.289> still<00:04:53.280> got<00:04:53.460> my<00:04:53.580> fine<00:04:53.909> wire<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.570> I'm

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
downwards still got my fine wire and I'm

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.360 
downwards still got my fine wire and I'm
going<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.870> pass<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.590> through<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.070> top

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
going to pass that up through the top

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.570 
going to pass that up through the top
and<00:04:56.610> add<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.330> bead<00:04:57.690> now<00:04:58.620> I've<00:04:58.770> added<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.220> slightly

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
and add a bead now I've added a slightly

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.580 
and add a bead now I've added a slightly
flattened<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.449> an<00:05:00.570> emerald<00:05:00.690> bead<00:05:01.139> is<00:05:01.349> this

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
flattened it's an emerald bead is this

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.770 
flattened it's an emerald bead is this
and<00:05:01.919> it's<00:05:02.550> looking<00:05:02.789> a<00:05:02.849> bit<00:05:02.970> misshapen<00:05:03.360> but

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
and it's looking a bit misshapen but

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.200 
and it's looking a bit misshapen but
it's<00:05:03.900> rather<00:05:04.110> nice<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.220> I've<00:05:05.310> gone<00:05:05.460> underneath

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
it's rather nice so I've gone underneath

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.730 
it's rather nice so I've gone underneath
and<00:05:06.449> back<00:05:06.720> up<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.380> top

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
and back up to the top

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.650 
and back up to the top
and<00:05:09.010> then<00:05:09.460> what<00:05:09.640> I'll<00:05:09.820> probably<00:05:09.970> do<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.330> pass

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
and then what I'll probably do is pass

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.200 
and then what I'll probably do is pass
it<00:05:10.900> through<00:05:11.110> again<00:05:11.730> there<00:05:12.730> you<00:05:12.880> go<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.150> can

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
it through again there you go you can

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.660 
it through again there you go you can
see<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.890> see<00:05:15.130> how<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.400> sort<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
see it there and see how it's sort of

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.670 
see it there and see how it's sort of
just<00:05:15.730> proud<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:18.100> wire<00:05:18.280> work<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:19.530> then<00:05:20.530> the

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
just proud of the wire work and then the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.420 
just proud of the wire work and then the
wire<00:05:20.830> comes<00:05:21.280> back<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.360> top<00:05:22.600> again<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:24.370> you

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
wire comes back to the top again so you

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.430 
wire comes back to the top again so you
sort<00:05:24.670> of<00:05:24.730> stitched<00:05:25.540> it<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:25.900> as<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.200> you<00:05:26.320> were

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
sort of stitched it on as if you were

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.440 
sort of stitched it on as if you were
you're<00:05:26.950> stitching<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.400> button<00:05:27.760> into<00:05:28.000> place<00:05:28.210> or

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
you're stitching a button into place or

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.180 
you're stitching a button into place or
something

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
something

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.580 
something
now<00:05:30.190> I'm<00:05:30.400> threading<00:05:31.030> my<00:05:31.210> beads<00:05:31.480> on<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:32.410> are

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
now I'm threading my beads on that are

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.980 
now I'm threading my beads on that are
going<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.950> go<00:05:33.100> around<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.730> edge<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.540> I

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
going to go around the edge and I

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.810 
going to go around the edge and I
started<00:05:35.440> with<00:05:35.650> three<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.250> I'm<00:05:36.400> gonna<00:05:36.520> keep

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
started with three and I'm gonna keep

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.540 
started with three and I'm gonna keep
going<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:38.410> so<00:05:38.590> I've<00:05:38.710> got<00:05:38.830> enough<00:05:39.040> beads<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:39.520> go

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
going and so I've got enough beads to go

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.730 
going and so I've got enough beads to go
all<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:39.880> way<00:05:39.910> around<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.290> see<00:05:41.530> how<00:05:41.680> I've

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
all the way around so you see how I've

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.670 
all the way around so you see how I've
got<00:05:41.920> seven<00:05:42.460> amber<00:05:43.120> beads<00:05:43.330> here<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:44.050> bit<00:05:44.230> machete

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
got seven amber beads here a bit machete

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.440 
got seven amber beads here a bit machete
probably<00:05:45.190> needs<00:05:45.400> eight<00:05:45.640> if<00:05:45.970> there<00:05:46.180> were<00:05:46.240> four

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
probably needs eight if there were four

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.660 
probably needs eight if there were four
mills<00:05:46.720> but<00:05:47.050> they're<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> bit<00:05:47.890> bigger<00:05:48.220> then<00:05:48.550> I've

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
mills but they're a bit bigger then I've

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.090 
mills but they're a bit bigger then I've
gone<00:05:48.880> back<00:05:49.300> down<00:05:49.860> underneath<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.220> ring<00:05:51.450> and

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
gone back down underneath the ring and

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.460 
gone back down underneath the ring and
then<00:05:54.100> I've<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.280> wrapping<00:05:54.910> around<00:05:55.270> if<00:05:56.110> you

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
then I've just wrapping around if you

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.980 
then I've just wrapping around if you
sort<00:05:56.680> of<00:05:56.770> loop<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.700> wire<00:05:57.910> around<00:05:58.210> underneath

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
sort of loop the wire around underneath

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.170 
sort of loop the wire around underneath
bead<00:05:59.380> their<00:05:59.860> beads<00:06:00.130> in<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.430> circular<00:06:00.700> motion

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
bead their beads in a circular motion

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.590 
bead their beads in a circular motion
you<00:06:01.960> can<00:06:02.110> then<00:06:02.320> go<00:06:02.500> back<00:06:02.740> through<00:06:02.770> again<00:06:03.600> just

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
you can then go back through again just

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.750 
you can then go back through again just
sort<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:04.840> finish<00:06:05.170> it<00:06:05.350> off<00:06:05.560> wrap<00:06:06.430> it<00:06:06.640> round

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
sort of finish it off wrap it round

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.360 
sort of finish it off wrap it round
anyway<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.390> can<00:06:07.750> just<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.710> couple<00:06:08.920> of<00:06:09.100> times

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
anyway you can just a couple of times

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.660 
anyway you can just a couple of times
you<00:06:09.550> know<00:06:09.610> just<00:06:09.910> just<00:06:10.390> loop<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.050> round<00:06:11.670> I've

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
you know just just loop it round I've

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.790 
you know just just loop it round I've
gone<00:06:13.450> through<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.870> loop<00:06:14.020> that<00:06:14.290> you<00:06:14.410> can<00:06:14.560> see

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
gone through that loop that you can see

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.380 
gone through that loop that you can see
there<00:06:15.040> and<00:06:15.250> I'll<00:06:15.340> pull<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.610> tight<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.300> I'll

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
there and I'll pull it tight and I'll

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.840 
there and I'll pull it tight and I'll
wrap<00:06:16.570> around<00:06:16.810> two<00:06:17.050> or<00:06:17.140> three<00:06:17.320> times<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:18.040> then

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
wrap around two or three times and then

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.650 
wrap around two or three times and then
just<00:06:19.180> using<00:06:19.600> a<00:06:19.870> pair<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.140> pliers<00:06:20.530> I<00:06:20.950> can<00:06:21.190> just

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
just using a pair of pliers I can just

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.400 
just using a pair of pliers I can just
snip<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:22.960> off<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:24.690> sort<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.720> press<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.230> down

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
snip that off and sort of press it down

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.980 
snip that off and sort of press it down
to<00:06:26.620> make<00:06:26.740> sure<00:06:26.950> it<00:06:27.310> does

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
to make sure it does

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.570 
to make sure it does
now<00:06:28.990> as<00:06:29.080> you<00:06:29.170> can<00:06:29.320> see<00:06:29.500> I've<00:06:29.590> got<00:06:29.740> three<00:06:29.800> one

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
now as you can see I've got three one

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.920 
now as you can see I've got three one
looks<00:06:30.790> like<00:06:31.000> a<00:06:31.030> ring<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:31.450> the<00:06:31.510> other<00:06:31.630> two

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
looks like a ring and the other two

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.860 
looks like a ring and the other two
don't<00:06:32.700> what<00:06:33.700> I've<00:06:33.850> done<00:06:34.060> is<00:06:34.270> you've<00:06:34.510> got<00:06:34.660> one

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
don't what I've done is you've got one

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.720 
don't what I've done is you've got one
that<00:06:35.050> looks<00:06:35.080> like<00:06:35.380> a<00:06:35.410> ring<00:06:35.740> which<00:06:36.310> is<00:06:36.340> great

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
that looks like a ring which is great

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.340 
that looks like a ring which is great
but<00:06:37.000> then<00:06:37.180> what<00:06:37.360> you<00:06:37.390> can<00:06:37.540> do<00:06:37.780> is<00:06:37.960> you<00:06:38.050> can<00:06:38.170> get

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
but then what you can do is you can get

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.950 
but then what you can do is you can get
hold<00:06:38.560> of<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.740> shank<00:06:39.040> of<00:06:39.190> the<00:06:39.250> ring<00:06:39.490> and<00:06:39.960> pull

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
hold of the shank of the ring and pull

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.690 
hold of the shank of the ring and pull
it<00:06:41.110> apart<00:06:41.290> and<00:06:41.830> separate<00:06:42.430> it

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
it apart and separate it

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.780 
it apart and separate it
once<00:06:44.420> you<00:06:44.660> separated<00:06:45.620> it<00:06:45.800> keep<00:06:46.100> going<00:06:46.400> until

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
once you separated it keep going until

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.040 
once you separated it keep going until
it's<00:06:47.420> all<00:06:47.720> the<00:06:47.780> way<00:06:48.290> flat<00:06:49.180> so<00:06:50.180> it's<00:06:50.360> totally

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
it's all the way flat so it's totally

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.950 
it's all the way flat so it's totally
flattened<00:06:51.620> to<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:51.950> piece<00:06:52.190> out<00:06:52.520> and<00:06:53.000> you<00:06:53.690> have

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
flattened to the piece out and you have

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.150 
flattened to the piece out and you have
what<00:06:54.230> looks<00:06:54.830> like<00:06:56.200> an<00:06:57.200> extra<00:06:57.800> couple<00:06:58.070> of

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
what looks like an extra couple of

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.630 
what looks like an extra couple of
petals<00:06:58.700> with<00:06:59.540> a<00:06:59.570> slightly<00:07:00.050> larger<00:07:00.770> than<00:07:00.980> the

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
petals with a slightly larger than the

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.490 
petals with a slightly larger than the
ones<00:07:01.850> that<00:07:01.970> we've<00:07:02.180> got<00:07:02.360> on<00:07:02.570> the<00:07:02.690> ring<00:07:02.900> like

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
ones that we've got on the ring like

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.370 
ones that we've got on the ring like
that<00:07:04.180> then<00:07:05.180> what<00:07:05.360> you<00:07:05.480> can<00:07:05.630> do<00:07:05.870> is<00:07:06.050> you<00:07:06.200> can

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
that then what you can do is you can

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.810 
that then what you can do is you can
either<00:07:06.500> make<00:07:07.130> yourself<00:07:07.730> a<00:07:09.670> bracelet<00:07:10.670> like

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
either make yourself a bracelet like

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.600 
either make yourself a bracelet like
this<00:07:10.880> which<00:07:11.420> is<00:07:11.630> literally<00:07:12.320> a<00:07:12.350> ribbon<00:07:12.890> pass

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
this which is literally a ribbon pass

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.730 
this which is literally a ribbon pass
through<00:07:14.000> those<00:07:14.240> two<00:07:14.540> loops<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:15.050> then<00:07:15.110> tied<00:07:15.410> on

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
through those two loops and then tied on

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.620 
through those two loops and then tied on
to<00:07:15.950> the<00:07:16.670> rest<00:07:17.050> or<00:07:18.050> you<00:07:19.040> can<00:07:19.220> make<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.460> pin<00:07:19.790> this

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
to the rest or you can make a pin this

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.200 
to the rest or you can make a pin this
is<00:07:20.870> the<00:07:21.050> same<00:07:21.320> bead<00:07:21.620> and<00:07:22.100> all<00:07:22.580> I've<00:07:22.850> done<00:07:22.880> is

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
is the same bead and all I've done is

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.080 
is the same bead and all I've done is
done<00:07:23.480> a<00:07:23.600> swirl<00:07:24.020> around<00:07:24.380> the<00:07:24.740> top<00:07:25.100> and<00:07:25.340> then

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
done a swirl around the top and then

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.140 
done a swirl around the top and then
rounded<00:07:26.660> the<00:07:26.840> end<00:07:26.990> up<00:07:27.290> and<00:07:27.470> you<00:07:27.560> see<00:07:28.370> it<00:07:28.610> passes

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 
rounded the end up and you see it passes

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.540 
rounded the end up and you see it passes
through<00:07:29.390> those<00:07:29.690> two<00:07:30.680> extra<00:07:30.950> wires<00:07:31.250> that<00:07:31.460> we

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
through those two extra wires that we

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.030 
through those two extra wires that we
flattened<00:07:31.940> out<00:07:32.140> quite<00:07:33.140> neatly<00:07:33.440> and<00:07:33.800> it<00:07:33.920> will

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
flattened out quite neatly and it will

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.250 
flattened out quite neatly and it will
sit<00:07:34.280> through<00:07:34.520> a<00:07:34.580> jumper<00:07:35.510> or<00:07:35.540> something<00:07:36.080> like

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
sit through a jumper or something like

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.310 
sit through a jumper or something like
that<00:07:36.500> so<00:07:36.830> a<00:07:37.190> scarf<00:07:37.880> and<00:07:38.390> held<00:07:38.750> on<00:07:38.930> that<00:07:39.110> way<00:07:40.000> so
