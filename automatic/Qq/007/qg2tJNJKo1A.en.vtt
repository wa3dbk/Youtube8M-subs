00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 as much as the rudder and I stepped on the accelerator 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.049
 of a magnificent pigeon 3008 let's see 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.640
 what were your impressions and if you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 you want to leave your comment or suggestion 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.599
 for upcoming driving tests you can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 do it on our social networks with 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.109
 the hashtag accelerator test do not miss 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.150
 the driving test of the rogue 3008 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.580
 come with us judging by our long 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.370
 list of driving tests made to 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.559
 Many crossovers must think that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.080
 These are our favorite cars 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 but the truth is this is a simple reflection 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.699
 of the great boom that this type of cars 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.769
 is having in panama in this 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.220
 opportunity chosen for the test 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.460
 it's again for the lion's brand 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.190
 specifically the rogue 3008 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 as it is already well known the way 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.410
 operate as a pilot in panama has changed 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.410
 drastically now focuses on bringing 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.940
 products of much more quality 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.190
 focusing on the product of origin 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.580
 European Union and in providing a better service 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.490
 after sale trying to give you the fight 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.399
 the largest in the market makes a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.460
 months when we tried the rogue 2008 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.970
 we were happy with him it was a car 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 comfortable and beautiful the 3008 has that same 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.280
 charm but we could say that to a 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.250
 superior level compared to models 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.039
 previous the 3008 premieres a grill 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.259
 floating with the logo of the lion charging 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.420
 more prominence something that the brand 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.560
 French has been using in other 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.200
 models like 208 and 303 in the groups 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.479
 optics we have a led journal headlights 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.149
 in its front part and in its part 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.670
 Subsequent lights that simulate the three 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.009
 fillon lion's claws otherwise the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.150
 model still retains its details 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.000
 characteristic 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.000
 the interior of the 3008 has not changed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.490
 much like before it still has 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.730
 a cabin with high finishes 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.950
 quality and a design very well achieved the 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.860
 center console has some switches 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.660
 to control intermittent and the roof 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.320
 panoramic below these switches 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.820
 There is a small multimedia screen 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.490
 monochromatic that allows you to give 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.790
 information about the temperature hour 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.190
 radio among others then we have the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.500
 conventional controls of the system 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
 sound the steering wheel has a design 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.959
 ergonomic that when handling 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.270
 It is extremely comfortable but 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.450
 Unfortunately, it has no button 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.730
 multimedia for the 3008 pilot has opted 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.730
 for a panoramic roof that prints 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.160
 amplitude and luminosity to the comfortable 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.100
 interior in terms of seats both 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.720
 front passengers as rear 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.420
 They have a good space for 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.420
 legs shoulders and head in the Basque 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.830
 back can be accommodated 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.980
 perfectly two adults of medium size 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.870
 even on long journeys the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.600
 trunk offers a space of 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.600
 pretty broad storage but what 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.900
 What we liked the most is the possibility of 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.180
 divide the cargo area in two with the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.000
 option to locate it in three positions 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.190
 different in that same space 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.490
 find two buttons that allow 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.640
 fold down the rear seats giving a lot 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 more space for the most voluminous load 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.210
 in the technological field the pinion 3008 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.030
 includes the latest innovations of the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.970
 mark as regards aid to the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.610
 driving and safety like the camera 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.340
 rear view located in the mirror 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.910
 rearview the detection system 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.120
 obstacle and parking brake 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.940
 electronic plus the new 3008 includes 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.850
 the measurement system a technology 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.430
 that allows the driver to know if the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.550
 available parking space is the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.530
 suitable to park your vehicle well 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.290
 as the track on alert 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.990
 the auxiliary range system between 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.350
 vehicles and to optimize motor skills 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.769
 on low adhesion surfaces pilot 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.800
 returns to equip the new 3008 with grip 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.960
 control improving the responses of this 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.889
 model in situations of low adherence 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.100
 the exterior and interior of the rogue 3008 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.700
 we found them outstanding in their 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.970
 segment but of simply handling 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.000
 we can say that it is spectacular is a 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.919
 extremely silent and smooth car 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.650
 handle your 1.6 turbo petrol engine 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.919
 it responded better than we expected the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.669
 the day we did the test, one fell 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.280
 rain something strong but go through the 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.010
 Bad roads and the common bumps 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.830
 in the capital city it was not a problem 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.560
 for the 3008 we also have to 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.340
 highlight the firmness of its suspension that 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.530
 it results in a 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.830
 better maneuverability when traveling 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.979
 closed curves the running quality is 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.570
 impeccable the 3008 is one of the best 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.270
 options SUV market 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.360
 crossovers and this we say with the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.000
 greatest possible objectivity is not a car 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.150
 perfect but its performance and quality of 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.280
 materials is very remarkable and to pass 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.889
 above many of the competitors 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.930
 thanks to that premium style that already 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.630
 we mentioned 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.850
 little by little, the market starts to 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.190
 venture more with these types of brands 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.699
 instead of opting with the most 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.009
 traditional since in relation 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.500
 price-quality pillot is one step 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:58.590
 go ahead here the test drive 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.590
 of the bio 3008 I hope you liked it
