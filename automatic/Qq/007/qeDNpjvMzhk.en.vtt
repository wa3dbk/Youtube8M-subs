I<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.740> necessary<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.000> tires<00:01:51.299> hook<00:01:51.720> they

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I was not necessary the tires hook they

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.649

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
time to replace it at 8,000 miles

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.609 
time to replace it at 8,000 miles
because<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> sinners<00:01:57.899> wore<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.170> I've<00:01:58.409> drove

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
like 103 I think on a long flat stretch

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.449 
like 103 I think on a long flat stretch
like<00:03:15.959> crouched<00:03:16.260> down<00:03:16.290> behind<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.950> windscreen

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459

I<00:03:17.730> don't<00:03:18.330> do<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> often<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.380> has<00:03:19.530> done

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
I don't do that often but it has done

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.720 
I don't do that often but it has done
this<00:03:19.830> before<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.930> think<00:03:22.260> that's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
this before and I think that's

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.280 
this before and I think that's
roundabout<00:03:23.730> 103<00:03:24.060> 104<00:03:24.420> when<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.810> thing<00:03:24.989> with

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
roundabout 103 104 when it's thing with

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.380 
roundabout 103 104 when it's thing with
factory<00:03:25.680> gears<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.790> doesn't<00:03:27.180> have

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
factory gears just it doesn't have

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.540 
factory gears just it doesn't have

for the steel stock on it probably gonna

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.990

been ordered and it doesn't been a
couple<00:04:25.890> days<00:04:26.160> ago<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:26.790> hasn't<00:04:26.970> arrived

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
couple days ago but it hasn't arrived

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.980 
couple days ago but it hasn't arrived
yet

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
yet

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.410 
yet
so<00:04:28.380> later<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.890> week<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.610> bike<00:04:30.150> will

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
so later on this week this bike will

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.810 
so later on this week this bike will
Nolan<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.870> factory<00:04:31.260> exhaust<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.980> I<00:04:32.730> don't

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
Nolan have a factory exhaust and I don't

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.430 
Nolan have a factory exhaust and I don't
think<00:04:32.940> he's<00:04:33.150> joining<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.390> CEO<00:04:33.690> forms<00:04:34.200> but<00:04:34.380> you

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
think he's joining the CEO forms but you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.270 
think he's joining the CEO forms but you
can<00:04:34.560> expect<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:34.950> see<00:04:35.100> them<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.340> there<00:04:36.920> so<00:04:37.920> this

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
can expect to see them on there so this

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.810 
can expect to see them on there so this
bike<00:04:38.460> could<00:04:38.580> be<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.760> modifier<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:40.820> factory

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
bike could be a modifier to factory

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.490 
bike could be a modifier to factory
tires<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.330> steel<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.930> do<00:04:43.080> some<00:04:43.230> curves

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
tires on the steel to do some curves

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.900 
tires on the steel to do some curves

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.760 
that they have the back and slide out a
little<00:04:45.120> bit<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.630> don't<00:04:46.140> know<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.530> motor

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
little bit I don't know it's the motor

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.680 
little bit I don't know it's the motor
release<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.280> tire<00:04:47.550> store<00:04:47.730> that<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:48.450> this

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
factory pro the winter tires which I'm

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.990 
factory pro the winter tires which I'm
not<00:04:52.140> a<00:04:52.200> big<00:04:52.260> fan<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.680> I've<00:04:53.160> read<00:04:53.400> reviews<00:04:53.550> of

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
not a big fan of I've read reviews of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.450 
not a big fan of I've read reviews of
them<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.600> really<00:04:54.900> written<00:04:55.200> on<00:04:55.320> them<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.980> all

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
them and really written on them and all

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.900 
them and really written on them and all
honestly<00:04:57.180> but<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.960> yeah<00:04:58.890> compared<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.850> the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
honestly but a yeah compared to the

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.990 
honestly but a yeah compared to the
Michelin<00:05:00.210> pilots<00:05:01.400> yeah<00:05:02.400> definitely<00:05:02.880> worth

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
Michelin pilots yeah definitely worth

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.960 
Michelin pilots yeah definitely worth
the<00:05:03.120> change<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.630> tire<00:05:03.870> tires<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.970> 250

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
the change of the tire tires like 250

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.350 
the change of the tire tires like 250
bucks

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
bucks

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.360 
bucks
so<00:05:06.960> there'll<00:05:07.560> probably<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.920> changed<00:05:08.280> out

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
so there'll probably be changed out

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.490 
so there'll probably be changed out
someone<00:05:08.700> for<00:05:08.820> later<00:05:08.970> too

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
someone for later too

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.680 
someone for later too
so<00:05:10.500> just<00:05:10.740> look<00:05:11.220> for<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.460> link<00:05:11.670> to<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.270> exhaust

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
so just look for the link to the exhaust

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.780 
so just look for the link to the exhaust
video<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.290> we'll<00:05:13.950> do<00:05:14.040> a<00:05:14.070> comparison<00:05:14.520> seen

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
video and we'll do a comparison seen

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.210 
video and we'll do a comparison seen
this<00:05:14.970> one<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.540> leo<00:05:15.690> Vincey<00:05:16.200> in<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.860> few<00:05:17.070> days

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
this one in the leo Vincey in a few days

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.190 
this one in the leo Vincey in a few days
we'll<00:05:17.460> do<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> comparison<00:05:17.940> swing<00:05:18.270> its<00:05:18.750> factory

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
we'll do a comparison swing its factory

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.220 
we'll do a comparison swing its factory
exhaust<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.280> n1<00:05:20.610> treats<00:05:20.940> layer<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.990> a

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
exhaust and the n1 treats layer and a

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.300 
exhaust and the n1 treats layer and a
here<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:23.520> thanks<00:05:23.820> for<00:05:23.910> watching
