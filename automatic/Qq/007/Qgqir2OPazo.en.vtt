the start position when you're playing a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439 
the start position when you're playing a
controlled<00:00:25.439> backhand<00:00:25.859> topspin<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.759> be<00:00:26.910> quite

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
controlled backhand topspin can be quite

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.220 
controlled backhand topspin can be quite
in<00:00:27.720> front<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.369> as<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.119> start<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:31.169> a

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
little bit faster with your stroke you

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.460 
little bit faster with your stroke you
can<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> swing<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.350> bit

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
can start to swing from a little bit

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.829 
can start to swing from a little bit
more<00:00:34.680> outside<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.730> body<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.780> a
