sensitivity<00:05:42.360> now<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.350> one<00:05:43.560> thing<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.770> mention

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
sensitivity now the one thing to mention

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.460 
sensitivity now the one thing to mention
about<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.460> HX<00:05:44.850> 200<00:05:45.360> v<00:05:45.510> is<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.810> fact<00:05:46.200> that<00:05:46.290> it

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
about the HX 200 v is the fact that it

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.790 
about the HX 200 v is the fact that it
does<00:05:46.680> not<00:05:46.710> shoot<00:05:47.220> in<00:05:47.400> raw<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:48.570> keep<00:05:49.560> that<00:05:49.590> in

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
does not shoot in raw so keep that in

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.010 
does not shoot in raw so keep that in
mind<00:05:50.070> i<00:05:50.310> found<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.000> produce<00:05:51.180> some<00:05:51.540> fairly

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
mind i found it to produce some fairly

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.500 
mind i found it to produce some fairly
beautiful<00:05:52.680> images<00:05:53.100> especially<00:05:53.430> macro<00:05:54.180> shots
