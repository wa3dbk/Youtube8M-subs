00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
manual on how the self-cleaning part
works<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:27.990> start<00:01:28.290> by<00:01:28.560> removing<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
works so let's start by removing the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.600 
works so let's start by removing the
door<00:01:29.100> itself<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.070> need<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
door itself on this one I just need to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.569 
door itself on this one I just need to
flick<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.570> catch<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.229> either<00:01:34.950> hinge<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
flick this catch on either hinge and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.020 
flick this catch on either hinge and
then<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> door<00:01:36.810> should<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> lift<00:01:37.409> straight

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
then the door should just lift straight

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.690 
then the door should just lift straight
out

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.400 

so<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:44.820> I'll<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:44.910> remove<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.630> shelves<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
so now I'll just remove the shelves and

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.520 
so now I'll just remove the shelves and
the<00:01:46.710> shelf<00:01:46.980> supports<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.410> put

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.030 
the shelf supports so I'm going to put
the<00:01:49.590> shelves<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.190> shelf<00:01:50.970> supports<00:01:51.690> in<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.830> bin

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040

then going to put that outside and let

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.550 
then going to put that outside and let
it<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.290> its<00:02:19.320> work<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:21.960> let's<00:02:22.200> spray<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
work let's get started on the door

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.539 
work let's get started on the door
Ivan<00:02:42.659> doors<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.019> made<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.590> four<00:02:44.310> pieces

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
Ivan doors can be made up to four pieces

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.420 
Ivan doors can be made up to four pieces
of<00:02:44.849> glass<00:02:45.060> thick<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.409> one<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.250> well

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
of glass thick like this one and as well

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.369 
of glass thick like this one and as well
as<00:02:47.579> all<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> guns<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.540> grime<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.079> see<00:02:49.260> on

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
as all the guns and grime you can see on

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.720 
as all the guns and grime you can see on
the<00:02:49.530> inner<00:02:49.769> glass<00:02:50.099> here

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the inner glass here

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.030 
the inner glass here
the<00:02:51.299> grease<00:02:51.629> can<00:02:51.900> accumulate<00:02:52.230> between<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the grease can accumulate between the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.500 
the grease can accumulate between the
layers<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.430> glass<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.060> we're<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.329> take

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
layers of glass so we're going to take

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.089 
layers of glass so we're going to take
it<00:02:54.659> apart<00:02:54.930> completely<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:55.890> give<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.069> a

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
it apart completely so we can give it a

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.460 
it apart completely so we can give it a
really<00:02:56.489> good<00:02:56.519> clean<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.319> has<00:02:58.440> a

really good clean this one just has a
couple<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.860> screws<00:02:59.329> one<00:03:00.329> on<00:03:00.420> either<00:03:00.569> side<00:03:02.120> now

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
couple of screws one on either side now

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720 
couple of screws one on either side now
on<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.450> door<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.049> hinges<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.700> slide<00:03:05.700> out

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
on this door the hinges just slide out

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.569 
on this door the hinges just slide out
at<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.060> bottom<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:10.709> all<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.489> them

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.280 
at the bottom there but all of them
doors<00:03:11.760> are<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:11.909> little<00:03:12.030> bit<00:03:12.239> different<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:13.170> how

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
doors are a little bit different in how

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.399 
doors are a little bit different in how
they're<00:03:13.470> put<00:03:13.620> together<00:03:15.049> but<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:16.170> not<00:03:16.260> too

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
they're put together but it's not too

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.770 
they're put together but it's not too
difficult<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.799> work<00:03:16.920> out<00:03:17.159> how<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
difficult to work out how to do that and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.289 
difficult to work out how to do that and
then<00:03:19.409> on<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.099> one<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:20.790> slide<00:03:21.030> these

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
then on this one I can just slide these

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.229 
then on this one I can just slide these
end<00:03:21.540> pieces<00:03:21.750> off<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.670> then<00:03:24.319> separate<00:03:25.319> out<00:03:26.239> the
