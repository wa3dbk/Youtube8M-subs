00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.330
 Whats 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.640
 Such a dismissed because the slap formula 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.470
 It is convenient for time 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.690
 Also the Tteyuu I horse was sleeping to come 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:25.310
 Because it was a story that the postage is included 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.970
 It'd a moment of talking to might be no bonus from this 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.290
 I do not know well, but when I bought it was that the reason comes 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.290
 I bought a little 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.560
 I bought it 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.410
 Gunma Time 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.970
 Tei was 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.320
 I would like to open it immediately 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.740
 Here 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.280
 I'm a watch with slap type 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.260
 Also missing slap equation if put people Tteyuu know Well 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 Since there may be some people say Datte What I think would like to little explanation 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 It's a sluggish reception 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.480
 go 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 But it is not out of reach 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.730
 Metal fittings too 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.930
 adam 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.620
 This I'm a little is that easy to put 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620
 Fix it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.259
 only this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.259
 I can do that 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.040
 It would be cool this 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.940
 Even the face of the rich watch 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.940
 It can also be used man probably cool a feeling that Tsu use also the owner who 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.060
 It's pretty good 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.480
 I bought the document this time 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.830
 Oh dear 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.190
 Close 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.870
 It is not fit into any clothes without objection 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.230
 So I wanted to say that it was cool 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.450
 is not it cool 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.450
 I take a polo time 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.119
 Gunma Time Berry There are also various bar times before 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.119
 I think this Perry is the best festival cool 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.560
 Already 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.880
 It 's kinda 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.240
 I was worried and bought it 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.319
 It was cheap for me 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.240
 Outside 4,000 yen 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.500
 Though it was including the postage 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.890
 I do not know what will happen from now on 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.890
 Also this 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.560
 I was fashionable 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.880
 I want to put on more and more 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.040
 That came with after bonus 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.120
 This Rune of Time original 2.0 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.080
 But it was 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 It is said that the color is random, so I received black this time 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 Yes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.040
 I would like to open it again 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.650
 After this 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.310
 It is said that it is a race 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.230
 Ghost 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.580
 Yes 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.580
 5 It is a shoelace, but with a strange shoelace 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.530
 You're free to buy one or more single 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.340
 Not all shoelaces are the same 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:32.040
 It is a shoelace that can be put on one hole at a time 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.040
 I also think that this is an introducer 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.880

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.110
