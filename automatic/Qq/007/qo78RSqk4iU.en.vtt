00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.449
 the nasa 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.449
 action 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.400
 - I'm sure the day was hard to bring a chance for the 6 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.749
 millions of Jews were kid in the game 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:34.690
 the faithful 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.760
 saint-vil schiavo and under

 cinema show face 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.329
 nintendo wii but also had postage for complaints and 2003 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.940
 Then you talked about the challenge. 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 in the b series every year I say that I've never been much is fictional is because 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 I did not have opportunity to play all the games of this key the first 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.210
 group members o attacker jô 99 a long time ago but I finished 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.860
 not being able to follow the series in their game if they know different from the two me 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.590
 now he laughed with david willis that I see here launched the saleh that already brings 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.660
 memoirs 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.350
 and I was in doubt the footprints did not take because because I was so long 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.170
 away from the series bumbling cide accompanies direct story plus me 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.750
 I discover that he was a councilman and boutique of the first one that was champion in first 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.610
 of the very key to speak by email and that is not a remake 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.670
 already pick up on the story and try to actually update appendices 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.020
 reimagining the game 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 in the whole story is told in a slightly different way he has some 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.090
 foods that continue but in a general way it is as if you 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.060
 look even history proves another new face the game already starts with must-be 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.479
 to government proposals 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.500
 first it starts inside an office 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.260
 species 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.350
 if you are doing therapy side and have to see that it is a not so much future 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.940
 distant from which you start talking to him and hypocritical to 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.979
 understand more about your past 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.890
 and several things you talk to him you can interact well will have to queue at 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.849
 game that is shown as if it were in composing your ideas and your average thing 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.399
 interesting kind that almost everything you do 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.719
 for history 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.799
 Since with those you talk to this psychologist 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.060
 even during the game if you have the habit of looking at 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:29.709
 women today assume that their weight here was very sensual and 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.260
 Are you still wet? 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.340
 very plague propaganda of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.310
 dedé bernardo 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.180
 drinks machines more influenced by the end of the game too 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 and besides the thing that does and cool berinho also that did not happen in the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.740
 first game is that this time you are not armed next September 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.769
 with the flashlight 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.980
 in the action in the air in the hands and that this in no moment will serve of some 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.569
 shape you 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.900
 is to fight against some monks who appeared free in favor of the difficulty 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.650
 mec has every reason and in most of it you just exploring the location of the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.870
 event 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.739
 discovering the things that happen clark thus making the game more 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.720
 investigate 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.450
 ivone than increase in bbc survival of thing but there is some in 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.770
 sequences especially mission to call old nightmares that you 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.390
 generally are a chaotic world snow frozen film pe maresias 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.830
 all there are various creatures tapping wines goals for health allied to them 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.020
 I'll chase you down and when that happens when this meeting if it can run away 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.510
 and stand as you confront them and it gives a half deco feel 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.739
 panic and despair so you fleeing burned the crop so far little changed 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.449
 Christmas that I was used to by our team today 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.999
 The sad side we were fighting was how many deaths from equal to equal said 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.169
 already don cheadle smaller not quite the opposite the furniture are faster 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.269
 that you're stronger than you review the case places you do not 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.709
 reaches and it's the best you can do is knock down the wall 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.010
 a moment a certain thing 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.370
 is to try to block the path of the monster or et was as soon as there are some 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.470
 signposts day 15 can light one of them that our sat me satan with 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.079
 fear of it in the taste of neutrality would be in some ways the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.670
 timid lasts a long time he the serial will be fiction protected southport 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.890
 ensure their business 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.600
 not to mention that generally in this I met exit these nightmares you are in the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.309
 maze 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:30.939
 the discussion takes care if it keeps going round and round in the middle of this contributes 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.419
 with this feeling of panic 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.569
 now a thing that the game until in a lot are the controls of that moment 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.779
 when a pole holding you have to be moving the wii controls 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.449
 luiz directions that what shows on the mac screen but often is not accurate 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.309
 and this can get frustrating but on the other hand speaking of the Wii controls 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.419
 There are some things that have stayed 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.159
 very good for example 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.280
 I'm sorry that you can point out they were made using iel moutinho 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.240
 the really very smooth and very natural is already an interesting experience 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.080
 position 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.190
 and still speaking in another detention there that several moments are marks 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.419
 How we gonna play you have to answer. 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.289
 maybe they do not have united skirt of germany sorry owner control 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.620
 he also has some little boxes or 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.680
 and when his current position the sound of him playing goes out of control very interesting 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.550
 and when you have 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.240
 we have to travel of course our journey had to get out of mind control of form 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.880
 that you have to put it in the ear to precipitate as if it were a 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.590
 even allowing you to get into the game with ease 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.879
 much bigger 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.639
 another thing I found quite satisfactory were the graphics for the 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.309
 clear nail patterns 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:50.079
 and in addition the course expenses themselves do not garbage both he and the 

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.780
 agent too 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.419
 is very good following seven dialogues I'm doing 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.139
 practically cinematically accidentally 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.779
 no more is this is not a very long game click here 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.739
 It's eight o'clock two men and I can finish the fight, but I think 

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:09.339
 will want to play once more say that it will be one more time to try to do 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.570
 other choices of hindrance that can have repercussions 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.760
 now to conclude I would say that my recommendation is for you that are 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.099
 wanting suspension game 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.599
 the target of action of the ufpi assistance are as it was in some ways the first 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.979
 felt he also had a certain level of action the access road does not have 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.809
 a lot of patience preferred a game but with the dynamics and faster and everything 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:38.800
 if you notice in the weather for these moments of the recommended one if play I know that 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.580
 today they dominate these if it can even be frustrated, I have not been able to finish the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.059
 game 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.849
 this was my analysis of saint-denis and treminões I hope you order 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.119
 he has there his defects that can escape a little more than what he proposes even is 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:55.419
 a very good game 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.849
 if a movie was not made on the script of that game 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:00.379
 follow 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.289
 it is much better 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.819
 the person diego has been signed must have points like accessing the blog and for more 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:07.240
 reviews the arm
