00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
a PlayStation it's the I guess l2 um but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.600 
a PlayStation it's the I guess l2 um but
yeah<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.840> doing<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.740> you'll<00:01:40.010> have<00:01:40.160> basically

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
yeah so doing this you'll have basically

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.040 
yeah so doing this you'll have basically
a<00:01:40.730> limit<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.060> monkeys<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.900> buy

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
a limit of monkeys because you can buy

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.570 
a limit of monkeys because you can buy
grenades<00:01:42.470> up<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.560> yeah<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.400> reason

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
grenades up there so yeah and the reason

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.920 
grenades up there so yeah and the reason
I<00:01:47.030> don't<00:01:47.870> think<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.530> epic<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.280> because<00:01:50.000> it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
I don't think this is epic is because it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.260 
I don't think this is epic is because it
makes<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.410> game<00:01:51.590> kind<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.070> really<00:01:52.430> easy<00:01:52.729> if

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
makes the game kind of really easy if

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.020 
makes the game kind of really easy if
you<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.950> not<00:01:54.950> only<00:01:55.100> three<00:01:55.460> monkeys<00:01:55.850> with

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
you have not only three monkeys with

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.320 
you have not only three monkeys with
seven<00:01:56.420> monkeys<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.610> not<00:01:58.610> even<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.150> fact

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
seven monkeys and not even that the fact

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.210 
seven monkeys and not even that the fact
that<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.479> can<00:01:59.570> just<00:01:59.690> go<00:01:59.780> buy<00:02:00.110> more<00:02:00.619> basically

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
that you can just go buy more basically

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.810 
that you can just go buy more basically
I<00:02:01.670> mean<00:02:03.160> monkeys<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.280> supposed<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.610> come<00:02:04.759> out

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
I mean monkeys is supposed to come out

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.790 
I mean monkeys is supposed to come out
like<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.330> not<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.479> wonder<00:02:05.869> weapon<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:06.410> in<00:02:06.619> my

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
like it's not a wonder weapon but in my

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.499 
like it's not a wonder weapon but in my
opinion<00:02:06.890> econo<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.970> should<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.300> able<00:02:08.360> to

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
opinion econo is you should be able to

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.710 
opinion econo is you should be able to
buy<00:02:08.570> weapon<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.200> or<00:02:09.410> ammo<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.850> I'm<00:02:11.510> not

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
buy weapon for or ammo for it so I'm not

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.650 
buy weapon for or ammo for it so I'm not
sure<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.140> works<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.620> multiplayer<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:14.420> I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
sure if this works in multiplayer but I
