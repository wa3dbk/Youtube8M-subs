00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.620
 so love sports camera reshape 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 today the subject of fitness training is too 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.250
 home is dangerous it is good what 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.050
 Can you come home with us for training? 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130
 reach and I like to think 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.349
 a little bit, because I'm so kind 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.030
 the expert for that and who of course 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.840
 Honestly, if I said that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.630
 no training at home but me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.859
 I would like to say first for whom 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 fitness training for the home 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.699
 especially not in my opinion 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 appropriate year in the first line 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 not suitable for example ever 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.369
 for people with injury with 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.800
 sports injuries simply from the ground 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 if the problems with the knee with the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.100
 spine and so on 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.960
 you can just go home yourself 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.590
 bad control during the movement 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 execution 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
 there is no mirror but it helps 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.079
 should definitely be a trainer or 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.489
 also a physiotherapist on it and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 look over it that you the execution 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 right because there you can with you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.949
 the wrong workout at home more 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 break it down than make it better again 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 Of course you will have to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 Honestly say bodybuilding is too 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.500
 home very difficult yes you need 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 Dirt somehow needs a lot 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.570
 mass 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
 so if you really blatant 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 Muscle mass did not want to build up like that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 I made a lot more then 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.640
 Of course, no training at home 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 sense there you should definitely in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.080
 Gym go where the right one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 have the right equipment for it and the right one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.820
 weights in any case then that is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 very fortunately so I'll say so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 fitness training at home could be very good 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 do 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 you can also look like I know 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 Also that your goal is there are some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.299
 Of course they want a lot more but me 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 think athletic well-built figure is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.770
 with certainty you can you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 your quirks that callisti nothing or ob 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.450
 the now streetworker stop or whether 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.479
 that this free latics is there too 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 people who really have body rating so well 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.200
 a body exercise with a few 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.700
 easy weights what good body 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 of course, then of course is one 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.149
 fitness training at home very very well 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.850
 if you add to the endurance sport 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.960
 if you do so much endurance sports 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.030
 also football plays in his 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.799
 would make it one powerful trainings 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.259
 but can also be neat and reasonable 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.010
 building up muscles at home and for that 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.480
 I would like you 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.940
 recommend you try a bit 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.110
 equipment we can 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.790
 Of course many body weight exercises 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 But what makes sense if you are one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.280
 little muscle mass in any case on 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.920
 wants to build up at home 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.630
 brings you a weight bench once ago 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.710
 are so short smock commercially benches the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.180
 could imagine such a bit 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.340
 can also adjust diagonally and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.780
 just had a good set short 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.700
 depending on how far the now and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.630
 advanced so are up to 30 kilos 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.880
 maybe you should already 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.410
 and then you can my view 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.490
 after very much at home you do 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 you can do everything 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.200
 you can train the whole body 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.850
 Any exercises you can do and 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.680
 if you are so much in the moment 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.840
 Gym you have all the equipment 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.220
 but in general, here too 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.400
 At some point, changed 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.090
 come on the free weights 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.980
 to change that we just more 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.450
 I have my joint exercises 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.390
 these isolation exercises in the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.100
 gym big berner otherwise what that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.170
 There are no natural movements 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 meaning that in everyday life and so does the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.530
 isolated muscles need the joints 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.120
 not really cooperate because of that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.440
 makes it permanent anyway 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 change free weights 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.610
 and there you can with the short bank around 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.280
 with two kohls has so much at home 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.390
 you do not believe yes 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.200
 of course that's difficult at home 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 you have to admit 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.250
 At home you become very fast 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.020
 Derived distracted from the training he has 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.910
 as a little computer on with facebook 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.750
 you have a playstation there and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.090
 TV or something else you want 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 to be distracted at home, I think 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.320
 my big point and factor live 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.300
 Gym is a clear advantage 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.430
 that if you go to the studio now 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.170
 here exclusively for training 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.390
 at least most of the time that or do 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.130
 may be should be as at home you look 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.959
 distract very quickly if the 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.100
 cat off to caress so between the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.800
 sentences makes no sense 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.500
 yes that's why you just look if you 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.489
 you train at home missions heap 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.780
 self-discipline bring that you 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.890
 just say hey i pull that through 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.480
 maybe you can come out of one 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.130
 small training room in the cellar 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.350
 somehow set it up with you 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.000
 a bit yes website from the whole 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.320
 things or makes on all devices 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.709
 make you feel a bit local 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.380
 by 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.580
 I think home is possible for me 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.970
 shows that also my videos like 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.500
 said with dumbbells short trade bank 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.459
 i can do more exercise in the future too 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.380
 may also bring a split 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.790
 training and I know that many on the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.560
 training at home 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.209
 these are why keeps saying so 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.959
 we can now work out gym 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.609
 I do not think so 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.380
 many train in the gym 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.520
 really only with dumbbells one 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.860
 flat bench maybe a barbell 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.419
 and if you really do that 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.380
 you may want something like that easily 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.780
 set up at home 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.789
 you can have a quick short at the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.860
 high flat bench maybe in 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.020
 reken in the barbell as you are with 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.880
 me in total if you 400 euros for 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.020
 All together out there you can 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.669
 you a nice home studio already 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.259
 set up and with the simplest 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.060
 hire we can achieve much 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.860
 always the cause of the motivation of 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.330
 Discipline it is shit really 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.050
 where he trains you can reach your goal 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.870
 to reach 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.729
 and yes, in that sense, it just tried 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.139
 times if you do not have the possibility in the 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.580
 Gym to go 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.289
 In any case, get a few short ones 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.699
 others a small flat bank costs 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.030
 not too much could be there 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.320
 set up well with 150 euros and you 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.910
 then I watch my videos 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.440
 then in the future more exercises then 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.820
 really do too with dumbbells and 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 flat bank maybe just plan 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.210
 for this 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.470
 he may have 3434 aspect that she 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.389
 also because somehow ne instructions have 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.590
 I would be happy to see you through it 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:24.360
 I'm out or birch nice because mine 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.360
 presently present 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.510
 that is also so i am sure i am 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.289
 a bodybuilder but also with me 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.270
 also weak spots 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.090
 but honestly I have one 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.289
 just now yesterday during training 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.180
 how many calories are burning because of me 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.560
 My way 30 meters lead to three 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.240
 kilometer back and is the cardio 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.130
 training is very important of course it is 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.449
 not always optimal for muscle building 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.099
 if you are trained for cardio training 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.840
 but for me this kick is also on 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.610
 Endurance training is very important and me 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.349
 just yesterday , of all things , in a good momentum 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.780
 Bruehl trains well at my watch 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.300
 I have alone in a unit circa 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.800
 1600 calories burned as 1600 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.960
 Calories only want through the daily 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.490
 training is actually way too much 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.900
 means I would have to eat much more 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.389
 and also away the crowds on it 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.860
 but somehow i need to get it 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.389
 this kick of training I 'm doing there 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.240
 my haiti i pull that through 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.680
 20 km on the treadmill and then it goes 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.659
 me good that he really pours with me 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.389
 the happiness hormones I need it 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.190
 somehow and always is so 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.919
 thing when training whether your home or 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.569
 trained in the studio what is your goal yes 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.189
 and that has to 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.169
 always know yourself such a 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.759
 goal then looks what you need for it 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.020
 to achieve that and then you have to 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.999
 just a ass kick that 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.999
 I'm finally solve meaningful away
