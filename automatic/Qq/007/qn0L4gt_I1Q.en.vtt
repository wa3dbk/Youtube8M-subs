00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello everybody, and welcome to my year-end
list of the best that PC indie gaming had

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
to offer in 2011.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.220
Without further adieu, let's get started.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.849
Best Game No One Played: Lume

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.370
With dozens of worthwhile indie games coming
out every month, it's inevitable but still

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.500
unfortunate that some great titles will go
largely unnoticed by most people.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
Lume is a point-and-click adventure game that
came out early 2011 to little fanfare, and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.470
sadly didn't seem to pick up much of an audience
over the course of the year.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.510
Which is a shame, because while Lume may not
be a masterpiece, its beautiful, handmade

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.590
papercraft visuals made it one of the most
artistically stunning games of the year, indie

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.790
or otherwise.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.870
And hey, the puzzles aren't too shabby either.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.530
Seven dollars is still too steep for a game
that's only an hour long, but if you ever

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.810
get the chance to pick it up cheap, don't
hesitate.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.990
Best Music: Jamestown

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.840
While both Sequence and Bastion were strong
contenders for this award, in the end I found

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.350
myself coming back again and again to Francisco
Cerda's sprawling orchestral work for Jamestown.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.980
People often associate indie game music with
chiptune, and there's nothing wrong with that,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.670
but Jamestown's music is less Cave Story and
more Lord of the Rings, and it provides a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.409
fantastic backdrop for the equally (dare-I-say-it)
epic gameplay.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.869
Amazingly, all of the music in the game was
composed, arranged, and performed by only

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.310
one guy, but it feels so symphonic and powerful
that is was hard to ignore it as my choice

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.630
for best music this year.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.329
Best Free Game: Nitronic Rush

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.920
If you saw Tron: Evolution and thought that
it looked like like a nice location for a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.039
Sunday drive, then Nitronic Rush is your kind
of game.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.999
A self-described 'survival driving' game built
by students at DigiPen Institute of Technology,

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.359
Rush is a surprisingly good-looking, polished,
and fun experience considering it's totally

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.409
free.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.451
It's a little short, but if they tossed in
another few hours of races then this would

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:43.049
be a game that people would happily pay money
for.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770
Luckily for us, we don't have to.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.979
Biggest Surprise: Dungeons of Dredmor

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.100
A five-dollar roguelike with an uninspiring
title I'd never heard anything about?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.710
Maybe I'm just cynical, but given all this,
I was very surprised when I booted up Dungeons

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.350
of Dredmor and found it to be a funny, addictive,
and surprisingly deep experience.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.740
On top of that, it's hard as hell.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.810
I still haven't beaten the game, and I probably
never will, but there's no denying that in

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.020
2011, it was hard to find more fun for less
money than Dungeons of Dredmor.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.330
I'm not going to claim to be an artistic genius,
but for my money there was no game this year

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.440
where visuals complemented gameplay as perfectly
as they did in LIMBO.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.670
The buzzword surrounding this game was 'minimalism',
and yes, the graphics are subtle and understated,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.070
but what really stuck out to me was the dreamlike
quality of the aesthetics.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.070
Parts of the game really made it seem like
you were guiding your character through a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.740
hallucination or a bad dream and, hey, maybe
you were, depending on how you saw the ending.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.160
Best Puzzler: SpaceChem

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.170
Not only was SpaceChem one of the first indie
puzzle games of 2011, but it's remained the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.070
best over the past 10 months since its release.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.900
Building step-by-step reactors to turn simple
atoms into increasingly complex molecules

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.450
may not seem like a lot of fun, but once you
actually get your hands dirty and start working

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.360
out the solutions, it's extremely addictive.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.250
Sometimes it's difficult to stop playing because
it seems like you're admitting that the game

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.500
is smarter than you.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.240
There's no shame in that though; forget The
Binding of Isaac and Dungeons of Dredmor,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.930
Spacechem is the hardest game of 2011.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.650
Be sure to tune into Part 2 for a look at
the best games in each genre, as well as the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.620
most addictive game of 2011 and the worst
game I played this year.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.280
Thanks for watching!
