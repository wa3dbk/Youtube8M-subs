00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.380
 I'm with a makeup tutorial on 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.209
 makeup that I made in this video is 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.130
 which now I took the same position I 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.110
 thought that why not record it I'm going 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 now in a little while to a dinner that 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.770
 It's informal but good because it's not 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.900
 record it and so you can catch some trick 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.630
 there are some pieces that I made them out of 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 camera so I simply explain them 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.710
 the first was to apply the base of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 makeup that I am using now 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.730
 same this distillers that is to shake 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.160
 and the truth that is a fantastic base 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.840
 you do not notice anything applies very easily 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.760
 with my fingers I always did it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.390
 with your fingers because the truth is very 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.910
 natural and covers quite 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.200
 however, there are always some areas 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.629
 that need a little more than 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.390
 coverage as for example some 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.579
 imperfection some granite and so on 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.220
 which I use the stick of lerma 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.500
 vichy blend that goes great covers 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.119
 very very well and can be used with a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.550
 tiny brush and apply it only 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.350
 in the places where we need it and 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.050
 Blur a bit with your fingers the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.240
 true that is perfect and disguises 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.330
 super good imperfections for 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.410
 cover it over the dark circles 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.410
 Do not use 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.460
 diop thyssen de irak that is very good 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.830
 true that does not cover excessively but 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.420
 good for a natural look and for 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.240
 an everyday thing is going very well 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.250
 because it is the eye contour and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 corrector at 1 am and the truth that I 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.510
 It solves a lot like I do not have much 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.150
 problem of dark circles or bags because I'm going 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.400
 pretty good the next thing I did was 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.229
 fill in the eyebrows I always use is 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.060
 brush that the truth that I do not even know 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.310
 where is it because the name is already half 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.690
 fuzzy weapons I do not wear the glasses but it's 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.630
 of these that have on the one hand the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.360
 cuvillo to comb and on the other hand a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.450
 beveled brush that goes great because 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.640
 It is also very hard so it works very 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 well to distribute the product and what 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.700
 I'm using lately is this kit 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.140
 of kiko that comes first of all a 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.540
 sidewalk which is what I always apply 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.730
 first to place well the hairs of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.530
 eyebrows and give some color and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.540
 then just mix the two tones of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
 dust that brings the truth that works 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.360
 very well and in my case I think that is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.360
 pretty natural 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.730
 to make up my eyes I started 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.150
 using the chela highlighter pen 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.489
 that as it is very clear the truth that the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.609
 result did not convince me so for 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.849
 I added a little bit of the shadow 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.700
 cream 24horas tattoo I think color 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.950
 Maybelline 24 hour tattoo that is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.379
 the brown tone quoted and what I did was 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.719
 with a brush blur type 217 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.939
 Also, simply blur it 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.790
 creating a bit of smoke and there though 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.709
 quite subtle around the eye so much 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.019
 above as below 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.169
 the next step were the lashes not 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.000
 I applied any type of eyeliner and 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.859
 what I did was reforms very well with 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 this sephora curler that is the one 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.549
 I usually use the truth that goes 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.159
 super good I have it for years and 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.370
 He never disappointed me with his mask 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.980
 eyelashes use a chanel that is 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.469
 a sample that's called it hurt from 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.629
 Chanel the truth that if I could 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.579
 I would buy but in my opinion it is 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.439
 too expensive however it is a 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.430
 excellent mask hopefully not me 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.260
 never finish but once I had 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 my eyes made up and that the base 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.419
 I had sat down I applied the powders 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.159
 translucent use these from chanel that 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.349
 are the translucent ones that come in 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.599
 compact of all life and os 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.099
 It will surprise you that you have used a brush 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.750
 of those that are usually used to 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.760
 Apply the liquid foundation of makeup 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.310
 but the truth that I think they feel 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.459
 super fine powders with this kind of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.250
 Brushes because that's how you create a base 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.229
 uniform of dust so that everything 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.159
 Make it blush bronzer powder 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.430
 etc 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.409
 it will look super good and super natural 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.170
 then use the illuminator 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.640
 as it is such a powerful illuminator what 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.799
 use first to then be able to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.280
 Blur it a little bit with the bronzer 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:17.160
 and in this case it's called mary lou 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.620
 manager and is from the brand of valme I do not know 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.150
 if you can get it all in all 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.530
 Spain I the truth that in Madrid what 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.280
 I have easy because they sell it in 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.070
 fine perfumeries and is an illuminator 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.789
 quite strong quite powerful but 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.070
 feel very good I think that as you can see 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.380
 note pretty but good to me is the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.289
 effect that I wanted to achieve in this type of 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.509
 look and I applied it with this bt brush 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.400
 It's called a blazer. I imagine it's 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.800
 designed to use for rouge 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.610
 but for me it's perfect to apply the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 illuminator 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.990
 next I used the powders of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 berlin that are the classics my tone is 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.979
 the number 2 terracotta that the truth 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.990
 that here it seems very dark but then 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.599
 once applied to the skin it melts 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.490
 pretty good and apply them with this 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.880
 brush the real techniques also that is 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
 the multi tasking and finally says a 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.230
 rouge 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.360
 the classic coralist benefit the truth 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.550
 which is a pretty makeup 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.290
 use classic but good all the same 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.540
 are the things that I like most and 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.830
 I know they work for a quick look 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:26.340
 and resultÃ³n and finally another classic 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.790
 in my makeup bag and it's the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.880
 chanel lipstick from the rouge range 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.460
 coconut or shine that is called boy and is the 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.560
 number 54 is a super perfect tone 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.990
 natural that you do not even need 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.000
 mirror to apply and for a dinner is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.380
 very well because when we eat we do not want a 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.390
 red lipstick that we leave 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.340
 erasing thank you very much for watching me I hope 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.680
 that you have liked this type of format 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.810
 It seems to me that it becomes more enjoyable if 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.520
 you want to comment do not doubt it 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.200
