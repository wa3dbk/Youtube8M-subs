00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.529
 yes yes first day and we have already completed 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.980
 The truth is that this is what is more 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.420
 fucking bullshit 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.110
 very easy as well as even putting 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.320
 tracks 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.320
 it is very easy very easy it is sad of a 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.880
 disappointment because power what was cool 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.490
 of the system that was happening to you and that 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.619
 it was difficult so let's go outside 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.849
 difficult what was culminated in 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.489
 day and anything above level 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.950
 history not what you see at a glance 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.320
 does not speak or text that does not speak of 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.680
 nikolai do not talk about not talking about 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.870
 nobody does not talk about the other either, it's 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.450
 very strange all this and the truth is that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.760
 there is a problem this achievement is something of 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.300
 simplest ever created in the zombies 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.180
 not true that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.450
 an island without the creators of the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.949
 zombies because this at least I think 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.960
 that the burden of the community community 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.600
 you will not like anything because if I do not 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.340
 I liked it and I think half of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.070
 people do not like this as maybe 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.300
 I have a story behind all this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.770
 sure you have it but we're going 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.240
 It solves a lot what is the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.600
 extreme at least from my point of view 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.520
 and I'm talking a bit about the anger 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.060
 because I just happened right now the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.979
 stress along with dual with punch and type 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.090
 and well the stenee that after 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.360
 you just have to take four 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.950
 pieces assemble the plane 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.980
 once on the plane you will arrive until this 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.880
 area to this bridge if you want to go back 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.300
 to another prison 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 you get inside the two and electrical 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 and you go back to the prison 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.080
 then you can repeat the cycle again 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 that then we are 22 managed that simply 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.710
 catch again what gift is to return to 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.780
 do the process and reassemble you 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.010
 we prove that it exists at least in the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 achievement itself is an intimate thing and 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.740
 resolution before news of control and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.710
 view that the map is beautiful 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.790
 apart from giant is really one of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.700
 the best maps that have been created 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.320
 really is fun to play has 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.489
 many others do not tell me a little bit 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 makes very thought of playing as 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.360
 example another map more than very intuitive 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.110
 where they move you or the map the truth 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.120
 I give a 10 and the leiter n I give 10 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.890
 so nothing guys hope that in the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.890
 next story that is something much more 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.360
 good and long and like the previous formula 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.560
 which is how it worked 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.150
 So many people behind these zombies 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.800
 because surely if I had started 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.000
 with this kind of hysteria that I already tell you 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.950
 me that nobody would have followed this 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.950
 history 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.680
 but now that I'm pissed but yes 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 so and above all that I hope that 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.310
 when you go in some kind of event 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.900
 to leave, for example, everything was indicated 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.879
 This already indicated since it was the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 the interest was first made because 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.810
 It is true that it is for children 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.459
 it is very easy this story that is a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.690
 very large illuminated that puts you 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.190
 clues with all the desire to see if it is 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.580
 that if not if you're not sad it 's because 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.640
 You do not want 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.970
 so nothing guys a greeting and up 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.970
 other
