simple I'm going to make a 4-pack using

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.080 
simple I'm going to make a 4-pack using
some<00:00:37.090> five<00:00:37.930> inch<00:00:38.140> squeeze<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:39.610> with<00:00:39.760> quarter

some five inch squeeze just with quarter

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.840 
some five inch squeeze just with quarter
inch<00:00:40.239> seam<00:00:40.810> so<00:00:41.170> we've<00:00:41.320> got<00:00:41.530> pre-cut<00:00:42.340> five<00:00:42.609> inch

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
inch seam so we've got pre-cut five inch

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.180 
inch seam so we've got pre-cut five inch
squares<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.539> I'm<00:00:44.469> just<00:00:44.710> going<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.920> quickly

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
squares and I'm just going to quickly

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.090 
squares and I'm just going to quickly
make<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.489> four<00:00:45.789> patch<00:00:46.379> unit<00:00:47.379> here<00:00:47.620> so<00:00:47.829> I'm<00:00:47.920> going

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
make a four patch unit here so I'm going

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.250 
make a four patch unit here so I'm going
to<00:00:48.160> join<00:00:48.370> two<00:00:48.670> pairs<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.210> then<00:00:49.480> join<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.230> two

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
to join two pairs and then join the two

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.500 
to join two pairs and then join the two
pairs<00:00:50.590> together<00:00:50.800> into<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.789> core<00:00:52.059> patch<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
pairs together into a core patch and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
pairs together into a core patch and
this<00:00:55.719> is<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.899> great<00:00:56.140> idea<00:00:56.289> for<00:00:56.649> using<00:00:56.800> fabrics

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this is a great idea for using fabrics

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.029 
this is a great idea for using fabrics
particularly<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.660> five<00:00:58.840> inch<00:00:59.109> squares<00:00:59.500> that

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
particularly the five inch squares that

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.220 
particularly the five inch squares that
may<00:01:00.190> be<00:01:00.250> themed<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:01.390> might<00:01:01.570> be<00:01:01.719> collecting

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
may be themed you might be collecting

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.829 
may be themed you might be collecting
particular<00:01:02.949> like<00:01:03.399> food<00:01:03.760> fabrics<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:04.390> example

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
particular like food fabrics for example

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.520 
particular like food fabrics for example
or<00:01:05.140> something<00:01:05.980> along<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.340> line<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.170> then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
or something along that line and then

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.870 
or something along that line and then
you<00:01:08.650> look<00:01:08.770> for<00:01:09.040> what<00:01:09.160> to<00:01:09.250> do<00:01:09.370> with<00:01:09.520> them<00:01:09.640> so

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
you look for what to do with them so

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.430 
you look for what to do with them so
this<00:01:10.030> way<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.360> showcase<00:01:10.750> them<00:01:11.200> quite

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
this way you can showcase them quite

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this way you can showcase them quite
nicely<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:13.000> there<00:01:13.180> I've<00:01:13.330> done<00:01:13.360> my<00:01:14.130> two<00:01:15.130> lots<00:01:15.310> of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
nicely so there I've done my two lots of

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.270 
nicely so there I've done my two lots of
to<00:01:16.140> learn<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.259> quickly<00:01:17.470> press<00:01:17.799> those<00:01:18.009> I<00:01:18.159> like

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
to learn to quickly press those I like

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.039 
to learn to quickly press those I like
to<00:01:18.340> press<00:01:18.640> as<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:18.909> go<00:01:19.119> because<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.509> find<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.869> get<00:01:19.930> a

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
to press as I go because I find I get a

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:29.010 
to press as I go because I find I get a
much<00:01:20.229> better<00:01:20.439> result<00:01:27.360> press<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.659> I<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
much better result press and I want the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.990 
much better result press and I want the
seems<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> go<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.500> opposite<00:01:29.890> directions<00:01:30.009> so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
seems to go in opposite directions so

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.130 
seems to go in opposite directions so
I'll<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.210> keep<00:01:31.329> an<00:01:31.450> eye<00:01:31.659> on<00:01:31.689> where<00:01:31.960> your

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
I'll just keep an eye on where your

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.539 
I'll just keep an eye on where your
fabrics<00:01:32.470> are<00:01:32.619> going<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.860> go<00:01:33.009> because<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.280> want

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
fabrics are going to go because I want

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.459

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
now so those two piers together and then

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.300 
now so those two piers together and then
we'll<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.780> four<00:01:43.990> patch<00:01:44.170> that's<00:01:44.799> simple

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
we'll have a four patch that's simple

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.270 
we'll have a four patch that's simple

fabrics and that it's a shame to not use
them<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.140> can<00:02:18.290> see<00:02:18.500> them<00:02:18.739> because

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
them so that you can see them because

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.710 
them so that you can see them because
sometimes<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.880> cut<00:02:20.060> them<00:02:20.180> up<00:02:20.270> into<00:02:20.450> small

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
sometimes we cut them up into small

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
sometimes we cut them up into small
pieces<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.319> lose<00:02:21.500> some<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.920> effect

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
pieces and you lose some of the effect

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.640 
pieces and you lose some of the effect
so<00:02:23.120> there's<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.510> four<00:02:23.569> pitch<00:02:23.959> now<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.380> can't

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
so there's my four pitch now you can't

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
so there's my four pitch now you can't
get<00:02:24.769> much<00:02:24.950> simpler<00:02:25.310> than<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.640> but<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:26.510> just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
get much simpler than that but I'm just

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.530 
get much simpler than that but I'm just
going<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> quickly<00:02:27.080> add<00:02:27.519> some<00:02:28.519> session<00:02:29.000> strips

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
going to quickly add some session strips

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.120 
going to quickly add some session strips
now<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:30.019> shown<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.380> before<00:02:30.500> how<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.890> do

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
now I have shown you before how to do

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.880 
now I have shown you before how to do
this<00:02:31.280> method<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.760> adding<00:02:32.690> session<00:02:33.110> session

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
this method of adding session session

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.680 
this method of adding session session
strips<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.670> go<00:02:34.850> rather<00:02:35.120> than<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.480> great

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
strips as you go rather than in great

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.500 
strips as you go rather than in great
long<00:02:35.900> strips<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.670> my<00:02:37.670> quilting<00:02:38.060> tips<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
long strips in my quilting tips and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.870 
long strips in my quilting tips and
techniques<00:02:38.630> video<00:02:39.200> number<00:02:39.470> over<00:02:40.190> five<00:02:40.489> four

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
techniques video number over five four

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.090 
techniques video number over five four
but<00:02:41.540> I'll<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:41.720> quickly<00:02:42.170> pop<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.890> here

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
but I'll just quickly pop this on here

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.590 
but I'll just quickly pop this on here
because<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:44.030> adds<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.450> little

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
because I think it just adds a little

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240 
because I think it just adds a little
something<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.110> this<00:02:45.230> core<00:02:45.470> patch<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.100> it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.210 
little squares I'm going to use this
absolutely<00:02:55.420> zesty<00:02:56.420> sort<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.750> yellow<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.290> I'm

just going to add some of these bits

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.569 
just going to add some of these bits
just<00:03:00.290> quickly<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.829> that<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.070> get<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> bit<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.430> an

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
just quickly so that you get a bit of an

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.560 
just quickly so that you get a bit of an
idea<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.959> how<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.470> just<00:03:03.620> set<00:03:03.799> off<00:03:04.570> fabrics

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
idea of how it can just set off fabrics

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.479 
idea of how it can just set off fabrics
that<00:03:05.660> pets<00:03:05.959> as<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.680> said<00:03:06.860> are<00:03:06.980> themed<00:03:07.220> well<00:03:07.400> they

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
that pets as I said are themed well they

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.770 
that pets as I said are themed well they
may<00:03:07.610> be<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:08.060> talent<00:03:08.269> or<00:03:08.930> something<00:03:09.920> that

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
may be just a talent or something that

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.880 
may be just a talent or something that
something<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.930> holds<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.380> together<00:03:12.530> not

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
something that holds them together not

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.210 
something that holds them together not
just<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.220> whole<00:03:13.549> jumble

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.130 

so<00:03:21.220> they<00:03:21.370> are<00:03:21.460> put<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.030> session<00:03:22.510> strip<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:22.960> one

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
so they are put a session strip on one

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.290

to have to keep pressing but I know you
get<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.260> much<00:04:29.470> better<00:04:29.680> result

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
get a much better result

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.870 
get a much better result
ok<00:04:31.420> so<00:04:31.480> I've<00:04:31.630> done<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.840> bit<00:04:32.520> now<00:04:33.520> I'm<00:04:33.670> going

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
ok so I've done that bit now I'm going

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.970 
ok so I've done that bit now I'm going
to<00:04:33.940> add<00:04:34.169> another<00:04:35.169> piece<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.470> I've<00:04:35.800> already

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
to add another piece that I've already

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:47.020 
to add another piece that I've already
prepared<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.910> top<00:04:37.120> there

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.980 

so<00:04:48.030> if<00:04:48.090> you're<00:04:48.180> going<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.389> make<00:04:48.509> a<00:04:48.539> port<00:04:48.810> like

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
so if you're going to make a port like

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.249 
so if you're going to make a port like
this<00:04:49.169> that's<00:04:49.410> perhaps<00:04:49.560> themed<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.780> may<00:04:51.990> want

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
this that's perhaps themed you may want

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.129 
this that's perhaps themed you may want
to<00:04:52.350> think<00:04:52.770> about<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.490> layout<00:04:53.669> this<00:04:54.389> whilst

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
to think about the layout this whilst

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.500 
to think about the layout this whilst
random<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.710> really<00:04:56.009> good

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
random is really good

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.260 
random is really good
and<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.140> something<00:04:58.350> like<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.980> themed<00:04:59.850> fabric

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
and it's something like a themed fabric

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.330 
and it's something like a themed fabric
like<00:05:00.840> here<00:05:01.140> I've<00:05:01.290> got<00:05:01.500> two<00:05:02.070> very

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
like here I've got two very

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.070 
like here I've got two very
similar-looking<00:05:02.880> fabrics<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:03.810> probably

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
similar-looking fabrics so I probably

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.900 
similar-looking fabrics so I probably
wouldn't<00:05:04.560> want<00:05:04.740> them<00:05:04.950> absolutely<00:05:05.430> next<00:05:05.820> to

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
wouldn't want them absolutely next to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.780 
wouldn't want them absolutely next to
each<00:05:06.030> other<00:05:06.210> I'd<00:05:06.930> want<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.200> keep<00:05:07.380> an<00:05:07.530> eye<00:05:07.650> on

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
each other I'd want to keep an eye on

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.220 
each other I'd want to keep an eye on
where<00:05:08.790> I<00:05:08.820> was<00:05:09.120> going<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.420> put<00:05:09.600> them<00:05:09.780> in<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:09.990> quilt

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
where I was going to put them in a quilt

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:19.550 
where I was going to put them in a quilt
in<00:05:10.980> relation<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.490> each<00:05:11.760> other<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:18.560> there's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
in relation to each other and there's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.110 
in relation to each other and there's
just<00:05:19.740> one<00:05:19.770> more<00:05:20.040> strip<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.460> go<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:20.730> there<00:05:20.940> and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
just one more strip to go on there and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.680 
just one more strip to go on there and
that's<00:05:21.720> going<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.020> complete<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:23.400> this<00:05:24.330> block

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
that's going to complete this this block

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.650 
that's going to complete this this block
but<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.410> would<00:05:25.590> normally<00:05:26.010> not<00:05:26.190> do<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:27.240> whole

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
but you would normally not do a whole

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.780 
but you would normally not do a whole
block<00:05:27.900> at<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.140> time<00:05:28.220> for<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.310> method<00:05:29.550> of

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
block at a time for this method of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.400 
block at a time for this method of
setting<00:05:30.180> if<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:30.480> is<00:05:30.600> only<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.140> I<00:05:31.230> can

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
setting if this is only so that I can

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.220 
setting if this is only so that I can
show<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.720> what<00:05:33.720> it's<00:05:33.870> going<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.140> look

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
show you and what it's going to look

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.050 
show you and what it's going to look
like<00:05:34.590> with<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> session<00:05:35.430> you'd<00:05:35.940> normally

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
like with the session you'd normally

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.090 
like with the session you'd normally
wait<00:05:36.450> and<00:05:36.690> do<00:05:36.810> these<00:05:36.960> aspects<00:05:37.620> at<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.890> end

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
wait and do these aspects at the end

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.730 
wait and do these aspects at the end
down<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.640> sides<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:42.870> piece<00:05:43.260> I'm<00:05:43.440> putting

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
down the sides so this piece I'm putting

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.500 
down the sides so this piece I'm putting
on<00:05:43.860> now<00:05:44.070> is<00:05:44.280> usually<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.730> very<00:05:44.820> last<00:05:45.120> piece

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
on now is usually the very last piece

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.000 
on now is usually the very last piece
that<00:05:45.540> goes<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:46.110> when<00:05:46.290> you're<00:05:46.410> putting<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.770> quilt

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
that goes on when you're putting a quilt

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.220 
that goes on when you're putting a quilt
top<00:05:47.220> together<00:05:47.400> with<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.480> session<00:05:48.690> poster

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
top together with the session poster

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.520 
top together with the session poster
they<00:05:49.380> change

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.230 

and<00:05:55.530> if<00:05:55.860> you're<00:05:55.980> looking<00:05:56.070> at<00:05:56.370> tips<00:05:57.060> and

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
and if you're looking at tips and

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.570 
and if you're looking at tips and
techniques<00:05:57.330> video<00:05:57.870> oh<00:05:58.110> five<00:05:58.889> four

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
techniques video oh five four

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.909 
techniques video oh five four
you'll<00:05:59.910> see<00:06:00.150> what<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:00.330> mean<00:06:00.570> about<00:06:00.720> that

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
you'll see what I mean about that

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.040 
you'll see what I mean about that
because<00:06:01.919> whilst<00:06:02.130> I've<00:06:02.340> used<00:06:02.580> different

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
because whilst I've used different

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.440 
because whilst I've used different
sizings<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.440> method<00:06:04.740> is<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:04.919> same<00:06:08.450> alright

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
sizings the method is the same alright

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.300 
sizings the method is the same alright
so<00:06:10.110> there<00:06:10.290> we've<00:06:10.440> got<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.650> block<00:06:10.919> which<00:06:11.130> in

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
so there we've got a block which in

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.010 
so there we've got a block which in
itself<00:06:12.080> it's<00:06:13.080> particularly<00:06:14.040> enticing<00:06:14.520> but<00:06:15.020> I

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
itself it's particularly enticing but I

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.340 
itself it's particularly enticing but I
have<00:06:16.200> already<00:06:16.380> made<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.780> a<00:06:18.780> couple<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.200> other

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
have already made and a couple of other

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.840 
have already made and a couple of other
blocks<00:06:19.620> here<00:06:19.889> so<00:06:19.919> that<00:06:20.250> I<00:06:20.310> could<00:06:20.490> just<00:06:20.520> show

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
blocks here so that I could just show

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.330 
blocks here so that I could just show
you<00:06:20.910> a<00:06:21.030> little<00:06:21.090> bit<00:06:21.300> more<00:06:21.600> about<00:06:22.220> what<00:06:23.220> it

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
you a little bit more about what it

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.370 
you a little bit more about what it
would<00:06:23.430> look<00:06:23.580> like<00:06:23.639> all<00:06:24.570> pieced<00:06:24.930> together<00:06:27.380> so

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
would look like all pieced together so

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.230 
would look like all pieced together so
you<00:06:28.470> can<00:06:28.620> see<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:28.830> don't<00:06:29.220> have<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.669> session<00:06:29.880> all

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
you can see I don't have the session all

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.900 
you can see I don't have the session all
the<00:06:30.389> way<00:06:30.510> around<00:06:30.780> on<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.500> other<00:06:31.650> blocks<00:06:32.070> I've

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
the way around on the other blocks I've

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.900 
the way around on the other blocks I've
already<00:06:33.300> joined<00:06:33.510> these<00:06:33.870> two<00:06:34.200> together<00:06:34.910> just

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
already joined these two together just

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.800 
already joined these two together just
made<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.090> little<00:06:36.419> for<00:06:36.570> Petra<00:06:36.960> for<00:06:37.169> patches<00:06:37.620> and

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
made a little for Petra for patches and

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.150 
made a little for Petra for patches and
this<00:06:39.810> one<00:06:39.990> will<00:06:40.169> go<00:06:40.380> up<00:06:40.410> here<00:06:40.530> which<00:06:40.950> has<00:06:41.130> got

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
this one will go up here which has got

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.500 
this one will go up here which has got
that<00:06:41.430> extra<00:06:42.410> last<00:06:43.410> signed<00:06:44.250> on<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:44.610> so<00:06:47.389> so<00:06:48.389> that

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
that extra last signed on it so so that

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.940 
that extra last signed on it so so that
was<00:06:48.630> really<00:06:48.870> just<00:06:48.990> a<00:06:49.110> quick<00:06:49.290> idea<00:06:49.710> with<00:06:49.919> some

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
was really just a quick idea with some

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.310 
was really just a quick idea with some
five<00:06:50.340> inch<00:06:50.580> squares<00:06:50.970> as<00:06:51.300> I<00:06:51.510> said<00:06:51.780> particularly

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
five inch squares as I said particularly

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.850 
five inch squares as I said particularly
scrumptious<00:06:52.889> five<00:06:53.220> inch<00:06:53.430> squares<00:06:53.760> today<00:06:54.090> and

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
scrumptious five inch squares today and

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.940 
scrumptious five inch squares today and
just<00:06:55.860> simply<00:06:56.310> cecht<00:06:57.320> which<00:06:58.320> just<00:06:58.620> kind<00:06:58.830> of

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
just simply cecht which just kind of

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.529 
just simply cecht which just kind of
sets<00:06:59.220> off<00:06:59.430> some<00:06:59.700> of<00:06:59.789> the<00:06:59.850> fabrics<00:07:00.180> it<00:07:00.300> allows

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
sets off some of the fabrics it allows

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.120 
sets off some of the fabrics it allows
you<00:07:00.750> to<00:07:00.780> put<00:07:01.050> some<00:07:01.260> of<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.440> busy<00:07:01.740> fabrics

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
you to put some of the busy fabrics

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.640 
you to put some of the busy fabrics
together<00:07:02.520> by<00:07:03.150> just<00:07:03.450> breaking<00:07:03.690> them<00:07:04.530> apart

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
together by just breaking them apart

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.710 
together by just breaking them apart
with<00:07:05.010> even<00:07:05.370> just<00:07:05.520> a<00:07:05.610> narrow<00:07:05.789> strip<00:07:06.150> of<00:07:06.300> sashing

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050 
again I've kind of collected them up and

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.320 
again I've kind of collected them up and
I<00:07:40.110> wasn't<00:07:40.410> sure<00:07:40.560> what<00:07:40.620> to<00:07:40.830> do<00:07:40.979> with<00:07:41.010> them<00:07:41.330> and

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330 
I wasn't sure what to do with them and

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.550 
I wasn't sure what to do with them and
then<00:07:42.810> when<00:07:42.960> I<00:07:42.990> put<00:07:43.200> them<00:07:43.320> all<00:07:43.410> together

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 
then when I put them all together

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.310 
then when I put them all together
somehow<00:07:44.100> it<00:07:44.220> just<00:07:44.250> seemed<00:07:44.580> to<00:07:44.729> work<00:07:44.910> and

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.320 
somehow it just seemed to work and

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.320 
somehow it just seemed to work and
that's<00:07:46.320> made<00:07:46.800> with<00:07:47.039> that<00:07:47.190> that<00:07:47.639> session<00:07:47.910> and

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330 
that's made with that that session and

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.240 
that's made with that that session and
the<00:07:48.389> little<00:07:48.600> posts<00:07:48.990> and<00:07:49.139> things<00:07:49.320> and<00:07:50.070> I<00:07:50.220> just

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250 
the little posts and things and I just

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.250 
the little posts and things and I just
think<00:07:50.580> that<00:07:50.760> that's<00:07:50.940> a<00:07:51.240> great<00:07:51.630> way<00:07:51.720> to<00:07:51.930> use

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.260 
think that that's a great way to use

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.659 
think that that's a great way to use
some<00:07:52.530> fabrics<00:07:52.889> that<00:07:52.950> you<00:07:53.100> really<00:07:53.370> don't<00:07:53.460> want

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
some fabrics that you really don't want

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.779 
some fabrics that you really don't want
to<00:07:53.729> cut<00:07:53.910> up<00:07:54.090> and<00:07:54.530> they<00:07:55.530> work<00:07:55.860> well<00:07:56.100> together<00:07:56.430> as

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:56.789 
to cut up and they work well together as

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.320 
to cut up and they work well together as
a<00:07:56.820> collection<00:07:57.350> so<00:07:58.350> that's<00:07:59.070> four<00:07:59.820> patches<00:08:00.000> with

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.330 
a collection so that's four patches with

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.229 
a collection so that's four patches with
five<00:08:00.750> inch<00:08:00.930> squares
