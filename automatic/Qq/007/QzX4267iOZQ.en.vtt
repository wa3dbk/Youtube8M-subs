00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 Hello my friend of the topic is in it 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 think that the x games for the bills 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 today we have the first few to the pi 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 so war the competition week 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 or the preparation in the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.160
 match week and here we will treat 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.849
 Of course, themes like that unloaded and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.450
 the load unloaded now also a few 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:37.559
 21 the loading pack 2 then comes suddenly 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.079
 still the weather of course and how 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.149
 The day of the match will be today 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 strong as I said with the unload 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.149
 The plant partly with me Monday to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 wednesday if the match on saturday 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.550
 so i have 3 1 hiking days too 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.020
 when I'm pretty local or very low 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.770
 carb almost to the end of the diet drive and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.300
 mostly so 60 grams km h -p why does 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.400
 now the unloading days so the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.119
 Endlage serves what the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.260
 Complete glycogen storage as possible 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.610
 largely or completely 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.549
 empty by loading almost a super 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.299
 Compensation of glycogen stores 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.720
 to bring about the optimal amount 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 cups stored in the form of glycogen 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.700
 Of course this will be the muscle 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.210
 increase volume and optimal 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.900
 fill up an optimal muscle volume 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.720
 to be able to present the stage and 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.780
 that's why the final position that then see 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.799
 Of course that makes you very, very, very 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 very local fair and come now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.259
 to pay before I go here now 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.250
 abstract rum la unloaded insisted 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.829
 me also from the energy sector 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 1400 kilocalories so before I lay 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.759
 at 1600 had another here 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.540
 Small drop over everything again 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.850
 Of course, getting out is an ugly one 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.399
 history just when you are 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.050
 but it is also so deep that one 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.630
 in the world is comfortable, the focus is 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.850
 high that mentally overcome 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.980
 also gets this further drop 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.680
 also take what I have to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.440
 eaten the days so it's like 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.650
 the environment per team with me and very much 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.540
 locally that means of course I can 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.090
 Do not eat as much vegetables as I do 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.980
 otherwise you are very diversified otherwise 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.280
 very voluminous kilos a day 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.300
 at least 700 800 grams 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.980
 and then, of course, come a few 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.540
 I had to work here together 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.110
 of course a bit restrictive 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.480
 experience 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.010
 that ultimately means that in 600 grams 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 Meat in the day so had the double 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 what else I had here the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.190
 britin then raise 250 grams 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.519
 sauerkraut is the best choice for me 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.030
 anyway, sauerkraut as a vegetable 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.920
 my top candidates for this of course you 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.670
 must not forget the Union 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.330
 came to it 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.820
 Both of course very little carbs 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.880
 because of the limited mass because 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.519
 even the one to himself for and then 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.530
 still as another white and fat source 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:27.109
 five whole eggs and ten eggs so we 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.480
 tidy protein can see the fat 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.590
 essentially about the eggs i believe 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.350
 One day I had a few more 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.090
 Of course you can add walnuts 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.430
 exchange a bit if it is an adequate one 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.850
 Exchange partner is almost the max 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.650
 herre and let me do that 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.920
 Let's keep on participating in the race gates 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.540
 After the training then everything eaten 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.220
 So I had no other 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.120
 team phase in the days and so I 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.579
 then, for example, a game of meat 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 we have union and sour pillows 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.980
 made then later everywhere 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.370
 that 's it, as well as essentially 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.400
 or split the meat meal 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.200
 have in two and still 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.760
 for a meal anyway and that 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.690
 would it already have been what that 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.850
 Eating is important because it is simply a motto 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.850
 locally and then comes the training 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.650
 to the so-called unload training what 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.870
 I then always perform or 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.139
 this is called nothing 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.699
 other than a light one 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.880
 whole-body training respectively 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:40.080
 actually upper body training because ever 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.350
 does not train legs 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.080
 why do you do that is because of how 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.430
 flat with get off it is so if you 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.050
 legs has trained when the legs 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.330
 neat to make that easy 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.060
 something from tight that's just one 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.419
 meat mountain no more cats 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.880
 see 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.220
 and until the legs become free again 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.229
 takes part of the wavelength and 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.289
 that's why it's me 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.669
 For example, eleven days before twelve 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.530
 days before no legs 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.490
 may train my last right 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.030
 during the workout 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.650
 let the legs rest at half the two 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.090
 properly clear of the water too 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.229
 get the katz completely to 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.910
 to get the match out again 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.220
 because that would be fatal if the am 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.030
 Both have just the day of competition 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.560
 look yes because of fat piece of meat 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.409
 if you have legs properly but 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.210
 it would be too bad and there 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.570
 some athletes already have problems anyway 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.639
 have their wines freizukriegen or katz 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.930
 neat to show by posing it 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:43.330
 is just not so far so old 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.889
 too smart then before crying too 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.000
 work out 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.409
 that's why the legs are let out 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.050
 upper body is trained around the 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.580
 moderate intensity so ready in the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.750
 classic over trophy ready 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.979
 maybe a little more in 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.169
 Power endurance ready 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.380
 is depending on which exercises believes 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.669
 a little bit more, so to speak 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.460
 workout to make the glycogen stores 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.590
 a bit more to learn but also 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.539
 not muscle, everything fails 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.389
 training what should somehow serve 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.169
 still great to tear something because of 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:19.129
 drops sucked, he tells 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:21.800
 who did 16 18 20 weeks earlier 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.259
 you can not do that in the diet right now 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.389
 more like some athletes do that 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.919
 sometimes somehow because in the 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.590
 last week in vienna still a big one 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.210
 Rad to which as I said only in the shop 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.090
 training unhappy google spokesman too 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.460
 learn and that's it and then follows 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.810
 after we have survived the days 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.520
 Of course, that's not easy because you 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.259
 of course, then finished by the 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.749
 follow the loading days then already 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.789
 clearly horny and call this week 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:48.610
 we in the next video so the 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.569
 thursday and friday 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.639
 because data is still a bit more 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:56.089
 comes together as calculated 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.639
 for example, the optimal amount of 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:01.819
 I'm on the pope to what I have 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.370
 Eat and where were the problems 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.259
 appeared 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.159
 because it was not quite this time 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.469
 optimal 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.219
 when loading but we treat in the 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.900
 next video 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:14.060
 if you liked the video then 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.009
 it likes to be annotated 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.529
 if you have something to comment on and 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.120
 otherwise people are looking forward to that 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:23.469
 next video always thinks about it as 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.469
 expand games euro
