 You can do it I'm going to leave the box 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 of information on your website 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.769
 Well, what we are going to do is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 ask him for the red glass as 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.399
 we want to make a gradient of red the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 dye that we are going to use is a red 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.480
 red as strong as it exists can 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 place only the tips and start 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.640
 from her we applied the dye was going to be 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 our legal degraded and we're going to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.660
 we are going to use the materials that a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 tint that we are going to apply a comb of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 plastics is very important the brush a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.420
 plastic bowl also water 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 oxygenated in this case is 30 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 volumes and coloring powders and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.130
 of course some gloves for not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 stain more now let's do the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.450
 bleaching mixture a little bit of 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.210
 dust and we also apply the water 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.340
 oxygenated and we mix very well that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.119
 a complete mix is very important 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.119
 complete 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 once we have completed the mix 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 Now we are going to comb very well the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.040
 hair has had the effect that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.840
 we want to create is that the tips are 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.330
 a little clearer what I 'm going to apply 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.409
 it is only this discoloration in the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.720
 tips 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 the system used is creating three 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.330
 minis crests within the same ridge 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.070
 and only by applying the product in 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.940
 tips 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940
 now 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.640
 with discoloration you have to have 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.250
 be careful because here it depends on 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 time for whatever it is so that the hair 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.720
 be much more blonde even reach 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.780
 burn by as you see as it goes by 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.000
 the time is clearly seen the image that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.540
 the tips are increasingly blondes 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.480
 now let's do in the mix of 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.220
 red dye we apply the product dye and 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.950
 oxygenated water and the same is very 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.640
 important a complete complete mix 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.500
 there with force we remove without removing the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.099
 discolouration now going to start 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.549
 Apply the product in the area of ​​the 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.579
 nape 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.379
 well here I made two mistakes one is 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.540
 possible that the dye is applied with the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.989
 discoloration but I realized that it is 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.220
 better than not because the manufacturer of 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.530
 Dye said he had to wait about 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.970
 35-40 minutes if I left the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.739
 discoloration with all that time 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.670
 possibly burned the hair so 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.709
 so much remove it 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 and I had to reapply the dye 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.239
 another mistake that as you can see is that the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.459
 time to apply the dye I'm over 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.930
 coming out of the crest that should not be 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.450
 so you have to be very careful and not 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.520
 about going out the lateral sides and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.020
 make it as clean as possible because 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.819
 if we are not going to advance the scalp 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.240
 and when it is time to remove them, we will 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.250
 be with red patches on the sides 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.860
 once applied the dye what I'm going to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:53.450
 do is a little massage so that 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:55.430
 the air goes well then let's move on 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.660
 to make the wait to send us the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.630
 manufacturer 30 35 40 minutes and now already 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.200
 when that time passes we will move on to 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.360
 wash it is important to go with 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.630
 abundant water to remove all the 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.240
 dye and once we have removed the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.620
 dye let's pass the shampoo me here 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.510
 use a normal shampoo but 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.360
 I recommend using a special shampoo 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.570
 for dyes to keep even more 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.900
 color once incarnated let's say 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.900
 soap 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.740
 and now we just need to dry, help yourself 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.740
 hands to create the shape and the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.660
 volume that you want the truth that yes 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.220
 here my brother is a little scared 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.900
 come on I crossed paths with a person like that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 down the street and what I do is cross over 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.050
 sidewalk but it's kind of our track 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.120
