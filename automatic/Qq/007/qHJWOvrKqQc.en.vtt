00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.320
 so much applies to all of the guys here at 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.480
 giuseppe rooms welcome to this 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.709
 video call of duty goals dedicated 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.839
 completely to mayday 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.480
 the extension episode introduced with 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.800
 dlc devastation thanks to the insistence of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.150
 my brother playing in this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.099
 mode I managed to register 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.050
 this gameplay you are seeing here 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.880
 final battle with the terrible kraken the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.589
 your final ideas me will follow 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.029
 the secret movie that is shown 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.919
 in the end get to this fight 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.480
 guys is not easy at all so 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.980
 let's see together what were 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.690
 the techniques used by the players in 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.280
 this match the first place the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.930
 main advice is to have 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.880
 a group of friends to play with may 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.440
 day in this way you can communicate between 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.900
 of you watch your back to each other 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.360
 of the four players you see 3 had 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.100
 in the doctor and one the engineer also each 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.990
 player had a certain role 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.340
 in fact the first was in charge of 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.530
 maximize ammunition 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.970
 explosive the second armor the third 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.560
 of power of hours of teams while the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.210
 fourth to the feline instinct 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.590
 all had the riot shield 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.870
 I think it's fundamental because 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.189
 putting it back you can just put it 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.380
 behind your back and remember that 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.630
 will cover your shoulders so you will suffer less 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.729
 shoulder damage they all had 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.899
 explosive ammunition and one single piece 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.429
 player who had ammunition 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.259
 perforators that I recommend 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.060
 use to break down the rhinos in the 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.380
 course of the collision the crack nor repeat 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.240
 more or less always the same movements 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.100
 so it's important to do a little 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 Practice starting to understand more or less 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.340
 how the attacks moves more 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.320
 however devastating are those with i 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.359
 be careful because tentacles 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.159
 however a single attack if it catches you 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.479
 in full he sends you completely 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.609
 to the ground 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.229
 moreover, what will also sometimes sprinkle 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.780
 the playing field with a material e 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 let's say it causes you harm so do it 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.380
 a lot of attention especially 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.090
 position yourself in those areas where it is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.590
 the alien material that of the hives 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.659
 to be clear why there 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.369
 you will be immune and will not strike you 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.229
 the only way to survive anyway 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.719
 in general it is to collaborate with 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.850
 maximum with the team and release of 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.229
 continuous ammunition armor potentiator 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.389
 team feline instincts 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.639
 if you notice here in the team everyone had 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.420
 a true mix enhanced with those ways 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.850
 different 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.499
 among the various enhancements precisely that there 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.939
 I'm the one who turned out to the team 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.800
 less useful was what it takes to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.510
 create what we can define 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.300
 alien and important turrets instead 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.130
 activate fixed and event turrets 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.960
 because you can still activate the various ones 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.850
 corners of the ship itself if not 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.500
 I'm wrong $ 750 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.060
 in this way you can be assured 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.100
 however to damage the enemies also 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.230
 in the meantime maybe you're reviving a 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.250
 friend or you're releasing that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.050
 they are ammunition 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.550
 sometimes the crash of there was also one 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.870
 sort of electromagnetic pulse that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.010
 deactivate turrets but not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.840
 worry because anyway 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 they will start working again after a while 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.980
 time despite all these tips 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.450
 anyway guys it's important to do some 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.460
 of practice then try and try again 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.770
 the clash several times so that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.780
 become more familiar too 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.030
 with the movements of the carnet above all 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.260
 try different strategies to find 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 the one that best suits you 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.010
 below I show you the puzzling 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 filmed me ideas that appears after 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.460
 fought the kraken then or greet you 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.960
 and I invite you to go to join the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.730

 description because you will find gods 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.900

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.190
 of the dlc devastation remember though 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.630

 make general I had a war were 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.620
 hit twice in the house one will bring 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.570
 the war on their land 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.700
 my sources report another colony 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.190
 of credits and twice that in 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.410
 colorado its source is a terrorist 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.750
 but he should have killed argy 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.210
 not remembering archer is bad 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.220
