another<00:00:04.750> thing<00:00:05.020> about<00:00:05.170> this<00:00:05.319> new<00:00:05.529> macbook<00:00:05.859> pro

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
another thing about this new macbook pro

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.040 
another thing about this new macbook pro
I've<00:00:06.790> been<00:00:06.970> very<00:00:07.090> impressed<00:00:07.300> with<00:00:07.720> the<00:00:07.899> speed

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
I've been very impressed with the speed

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.630 
I've been very impressed with the speed
of<00:00:08.200> this<00:00:08.550> before<00:00:09.550> it<00:00:10.059> was<00:00:10.150> running<00:00:10.450> the<00:00:10.630> stock

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640 
of this before it was running the stock

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.940 
of this before it was running the stock
5400<00:00:12.640> RPM<00:00:13.030> hundred<00:00:13.510> gig<00:00:13.690> hard<00:00:13.960> drive<00:00:14.050> I've

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
5400 RPM hundred gig hard drive I've

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.380 
5400 RPM hundred gig hard drive I've
actually<00:00:15.220> swapped<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.730> out<00:00:15.880> with<00:00:16.119> my

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
actually swapped that out with my

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.509 
actually swapped that out with my
samsung<00:00:17.260> 830<00:00:17.880> 128<00:00:18.880> gig<00:00:19.449> SSD<00:00:19.839> and<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:21.310> is

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
samsung 830 128 gig SSD and it is

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.999 
samsung 830 128 gig SSD and it is
amazing<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.779> I<00:00:22.810> was<00:00:23.199> running<00:00:23.499> this<00:00:23.589> in<00:00:23.739> my<00:00:23.859> old

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
amazing now I was running this in my old

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.239 
amazing now I was running this in my old
macbook<00:00:24.220> pro<00:00:24.579> that<00:00:25.509> was<00:00:25.779> limited<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.589> the

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:27.249 
macbook pro that was limited to the

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.870 
macbook pro that was limited to the
satyr<00:00:27.579> one<00:00:27.970> bus<00:00:28.259> this<00:00:29.259> is<00:00:29.439> satyr<00:00:29.710> free<00:00:30.130> the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
satyr one bus this is satyr free the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.319 
satyr one bus this is satyr free the
difference<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.630> satyr<00:00:31.899> one<00:00:32.290> was<00:00:33.329> limited

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
difference is is satyr one was limited

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.009 
difference is is satyr one was limited
to<00:00:34.360> 1.5<00:00:36.149> gigabits<00:00:37.149> per<00:00:37.300> second<00:00:38.039> and<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:40.180> satyr

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
to 1.5 gigabits per second and now satyr

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.040 
to 1.5 gigabits per second and now satyr
36<00:00:41.829> gigabits<00:00:42.309> per<00:00:42.399> second<00:00:42.910> now<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:43.899> was

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
36 gigabits per second now that was

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
36 gigabits per second now that was
actually<00:00:44.199> limiting<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.739> speed<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.429> SSD

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
actually limiting the speed of the SSD

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.079 
actually limiting the speed of the SSD
so<00:00:46.989> now<00:00:47.170> boots<00:00:47.679> premiership<00:00:48.129> down<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.519> crazy

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
so now boots premiership down is crazy

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.360 
so now boots premiership down is crazy
fast<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.929> all<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.589> applications<00:00:50.920> pretty

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
fast and all the applications pretty

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.329 
fast and all the applications pretty
much<00:00:51.460> open<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:51.820> one<00:00:51.969> bounce<00:00:52.589> so<00:00:53.589> for<00:00:53.920> example<00:00:53.949> I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
much open in one bounce so for example I

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.540 
much open in one bounce so for example I
came<00:00:54.550> from<00:00:54.699> Firefox<00:00:55.269> one<00:00:55.809> bounce<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.289> open<00:00:56.800> and

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
came from Firefox one bounce is open and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.209 
came from Firefox one bounce is open and
I<00:00:57.670> can<00:00:57.850> close<00:00:58.089> that<00:00:58.739> slightly<00:00:59.739> larger

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
I can close that slightly larger

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.079 
I can close that slightly larger
applications<00:01:00.879> like<00:01:01.690> Final<00:01:02.079> Cut<00:01:03.089> microsoft

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
applications like Final Cut microsoft

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.370 
applications like Final Cut microsoft
words<00:01:06.090> although<00:01:07.090> quite<00:01:07.390> light<00:01:07.660> applications

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
words although quite light applications

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.970 
words although quite light applications
they<00:01:09.100> are<00:01:09.280> quite<00:01:09.550> heavy<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.480> load<00:01:10.990> up<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:11.800> if<00:01:11.860> I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
they are quite heavy on load up so if I

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.800 
they are quite heavy on load up so if I
click<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.340> again<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.940> couple<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.630> bounces

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
click on that again a couple of bounces

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.650 
click on that again a couple of bounces
and<00:01:14.290> it's<00:01:14.500> open<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.820> also<00:01:15.970> see<00:01:16.300> actually

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
and it's open you can also see actually

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.770 
and it's open you can also see actually
all<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.840> templates<00:01:17.200> load<00:01:17.470> very<00:01:17.710> quickly<00:01:18.010> on<00:01:18.310> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
all the templates load very quickly on a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.940 
all the templates load very quickly on a
standard<00:01:19.780> hard<00:01:19.990> drive<00:01:20.230> that<00:01:20.380> can<00:01:20.530> take<00:01:20.740> a

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
standard hard drive that can take a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.560 
standard hard drive that can take a
little<00:01:21.160> while<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:21.610> previews<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.180> generate

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
little while for previews to generate

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.110 
little while for previews to generate
and<00:01:23.260> click<00:01:23.470> on<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.770> very<00:01:24.100> quickly<00:01:24.370> opened<00:01:24.850> and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
and click on it very quickly opened and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360 
and click on it very quickly opened and
that's<00:01:25.900> also<00:01:26.080> very<00:01:26.200> impressive<00:01:26.890> again

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
that's also very impressive again

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.580 
that's also very impressive again
quitting<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.930> quick<00:01:29.170> as<00:01:29.320> well<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.200> we<00:01:32.380> can

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
quitting very quick as well so we can

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.180 
quitting very quick as well so we can
look<00:01:33.690> that<00:01:34.690> we<00:01:34.840> also<00:01:34.990> run<00:01:35.380> if<00:01:35.860> you're<00:01:36.010> running

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
look that we also run if you're running

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.520 
look that we also run if you're running
things<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:36.700> parallels<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.480> you<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.320> a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
things like parallels and you have a

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.680 
things like parallels and you have a
virtual<00:01:39.040> machine<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.580> boots<00:01:39.820> up<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.420> runs

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
virtual machine that boots up and runs

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.820 
virtual machine that boots up and runs
but<00:01:40.900> very<00:01:40.960> quickly<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.830> well<00:01:42.840> encoding<00:01:43.840> you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
but very quickly as well encoding you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.170 
but very quickly as well encoding you
just<00:01:45.100> know<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.340> you're<00:01:45.610> not<00:01:45.940> gonna<00:01:46.060> be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
just know that you're not gonna be

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.610 
just know that you're not gonna be
limited<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.750> reading<00:01:46.960> right<00:01:47.230> if<00:01:47.470> you're

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
limited to the reading right if you're

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.970 
limited to the reading right if you're
working<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:48.040> raw<00:01:48.250> files<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.470> hard<00:01:50.680> drive

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
working with raw files of the hard drive

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.340 
working with raw files of the hard drive
and<00:01:51.330> you're<00:01:52.330> not<00:01:52.480> maxing<00:01:52.930> out<00:01:53.050> things<00:01:53.320> like

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
and you're not maxing out things like

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.070 
and you're not maxing out things like
the<00:01:53.530> cpu<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.130> GPU<00:01:54.550> actually<00:01:55.360> with<00:01:55.450> an<00:01:55.540> SSD<00:01:55.810> you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
the cpu in GPU actually with an SSD you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.930 
the cpu in GPU actually with an SSD you
know<00:01:56.230> it's<00:01:56.410> going<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.590> be<00:01:56.650> fully<00:01:56.950> used<00:01:57.250> so

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
know it's going to be fully used so

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.470 
know it's going to be fully used so
let's<00:01:58.180> say<00:01:58.330> five<00:01:58.570> not<00:01:58.960> Final<00:01:59.590> Cut<00:01:59.740> Pro<00:02:00.300> we<00:02:01.300> see

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
let's say five not Final Cut Pro we see

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.910 
let's say five not Final Cut Pro we see
that<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.690> still<00:02:01.870> takes<00:02:02.050> a<00:02:02.170> few<00:02:02.260> bounces<00:02:02.500> but

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that it still takes a few bounces but

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.280 
that it still takes a few bounces but
it's<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.130> very<00:02:03.160> large<00:02:03.640> program<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.480> very

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
it's a very large program and very

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.580 
it's a very large program and very
quickly<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.980> open<00:02:06.370> which<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.510> great<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
quickly it's open which is great so the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.870 
quickly it's open which is great so the
other<00:02:11.680> part<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.100> showing<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.460> beautiful

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
other part is showing the beautiful

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.580 
other part is showing the beautiful
shutdown<00:02:13.270> will<00:02:13.690> add<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.560> course

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
shutdown will add on to this of course

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
just about as long as the startup so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.050 
just about as long as the startup so
we're<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.500> highlights<00:03:46.099> on<00:03:46.310> shutdown<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:46.910> going

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
we're on highlights on shutdown so going

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.880 
we're on highlights on shutdown so going
to<00:03:47.120> press<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.390> enter<00:03:47.599> key

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.400 

and<00:03:54.400> then<00:03:54.670> we're<00:03:54.819> off<00:03:54.970> now<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.020> was<00:03:56.200> quite

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
and then we're off now that was quite

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.000 
and then we're off now that was quite
quick<00:03:56.740> usually<00:03:57.190> takes<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:58.150> good<00:03:58.750> 10<00:03:59.050> 15<00:03:59.290> seconds

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
quick usually takes a good 10 15 seconds

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.080 
quick usually takes a good 10 15 seconds
more<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.940> still<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.510> mean<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:02.290> know<00:04:02.970> no<00:04:03.970> issues

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
more but still I mean you know no issues

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.800 
more but still I mean you know no issues
there<00:04:05.730> usually<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.970> think<00:04:07.240> it's<00:04:07.390> limited<00:04:07.780> to

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
there usually I think it's limited to

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.520 
there usually I think it's limited to
other<00:04:08.440> aspects<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.490> macbook<00:04:10.890> EG<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:11.920> RAM

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
other aspects of the macbook EG the RAM

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.680 
other aspects of the macbook EG the RAM
then<00:04:14.530> actually<00:04:14.860> having<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.100> copy<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.910> SSD

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
then actually having to copy to the SSD

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.460 
then actually having to copy to the SSD
for<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:17.019> shutdown<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:19.120> overall<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:20.109> you

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
for a shutdown but overall it's a you

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
for a shutdown but overall it's a you
know<00:04:20.640> lightning<00:04:21.640> quick<00:04:22.050> think<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.350> as<00:04:23.530> good

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
know lightning quick think just as good

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.110 
know lightning quick think just as good
