00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello to all we find ourselves live 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.240
 of the racecourse of deauville on paris 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.240
 turf tv to evoke the quinté and 500 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 which will be played here on Saturday for 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.440
 your show received five out of five 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 with me françois charles with truffles 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.769
 which will immediately inform you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.689
 his selection hello françois 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 you hated seeing eight horses 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 and before all else you and us 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 to evoke a little bit the course of these 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.859
 1900 meters psf 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 yes then it is a pact against which 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.410
 it's better to be quickly in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.880
 head group 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 we saw it with the first 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 quinté of the meeting that of thursday 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.530
 the best-placed crook of entry the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 straight line still pulled their 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.310
 pin of the game so not wait too much 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 far enough okay so they'll be 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.500
 sixteen at the start you have to detach from 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.420
 8 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 so yes our favorites and the number 17 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 gentlemen I think it's the base that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.880
 behind the nine 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 Mind said not set léonce Leucate 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.680
 glorioso the 13 law flights 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 the eleven lower east side if the 15 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.150
 princely and the eight for maric and so 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 among these so-called prices still did this 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.759
 number 10 of such a manna that you 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.350
 seems inevitable 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.090
 in fact the races I think is coming 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 very open with a lot of points 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.570
 of questioning but we may have a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 good point of support in this event 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 17 with that number which the gentlemen 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 doors of a screen in top form 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.830
 Jean-Marie Béguigné cse is worth 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 currently make it boom of any wood 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 and he won the other day at chantilly 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.980
 pretty well the trio emile 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 Perez management is not rigged been very 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.140
 severe what for a horse on the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.940
 rising 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 according to his trainer we read in 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.630
 Joint pages in the pages 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 coaching pressure coach 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.409
 he works very very well on the sand 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 so no seven levels there so that's 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.159
 a serious base but when they 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 elected officials who made you choose magna said 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.190
 not in second position is good 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.780
 because she will find her way back 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.520
 of predilection last year she had 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.799
 been twice on this route 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.909
 precisely and especially in a quinté 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.470
 so it's true that its beginning of the season 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.850
 was way to put it mildly 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.500
 but we can trust him 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.880
 maybe for his return on his 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.750
 favorite course the hull will be 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 really interesting 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.770
 okay behind it's an outsider a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.080
 a little bit seductive you chose the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.450
 number seven shades that is the other day 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.710
 fourth of a quinté on the track of the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.569
 Jockey Club Chantilly runs very well 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 it's a horse that had already won and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.489
 on the course that interests us on 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.499
 the psf of deauville with some brio 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.370
 on horseback who has very early who still has to 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.480
 for 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 and which is one of the very good 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.569
 chances to pursue it to you have 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.069
 talked about open test and number 13 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.599
 law balls will not be the horse of 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.819
 everyone is the year of decoration 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.140
 interrogations this test it is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 really well placed at the corner 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.799
 but he's worried about a pond at the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.060
 good at his coach arises from 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.290
 questions with him then he goes to him 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.879
 put blinders for the first 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.099
 times this may trigger a 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.690
 wake up yes by the way he discovers a 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.069
 little sand is there too that's another 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.959
 question mark but I like 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.610
 the cabbage a little tricky that changes 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.290
 completely environment including 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.250
 blinkers for the first time the sand 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.170
 a discovery 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.030
 it can be a nice rebound detonator 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.010
 psychological yet your fifth 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 favorite is the number 11 of lower east 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.340
 side 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.599
 before listening to your fabrice arguments 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.010
 is archambault went to meet 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.519
 from his own father mathieu offenstadt 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.299
 we listen right now so see her 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.190
 and that's a fact that I come 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.510
 to acquire so I know it badly enough 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.010
 one that has proven itself on psf 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.349
 since he has already won on this track 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.480
 here it has a handicap value that has 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.890
 dropped a little so who if they seem 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.150
 allows him to hold a chance 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.799
 regular now I lack of hindsight 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.019
 since the horse recently froze 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.129
 time he has the number 13 outside he 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.239
 showed a waiting race will come 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.400
 to finish is a horse probably 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.630
 follow in this category here you are 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.919
 to say that he will be in the quinté d'ores and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.480
 already I can not tell you but he 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.650
 should run honorably you have 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.730
 spotted the chances of others 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.750
 competitors he had made a small 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.060
 little package where he had seen 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.470
 competitors a little more dangerous it's 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.489
 mine and a question mark 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.239
 because I tell you once and after 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.010
 that he runs for my colors 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.269
 so I hope it will run well but I 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.079
 think that in this brokerage no doubt 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.700
 the horse of jean marie beguiled 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.829
 gentleman who is a horse in my opinion 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.209
 who may have the size of a force 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.569
 like that more definitely than the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.579
 mine so we just listen to Mathieu 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.829
 young stadium that besides evoking so 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.599
 that his new resident has confirmed 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.639
 that your your favorite to know so the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.650
 youth number 17 such but what is it 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:03.239
 representative 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.280
 he had been arrested for several months was 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.349
 long but last year the truth of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.579
 values ​​very interesting and looks at his 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.930
 performance it is very well placed 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.430
 so he ran three times this year 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.870
 I am waiting for progress and at its weight I 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.000
 think it's one of the good ones to cider 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.799
 of this race okay so a 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.970
 test an open test and then some 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.380
 choice you have speculative choices 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.699
 I think that's the kind of hardship 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.500
 in which we can take a little 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.330
 more than very well we find ourselves all 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.770
 for Sunday's quinté that will take place 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.360
 always on the racecourse of 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.129
 there everything and we wish you a good day 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.129
 thank you francois thank you see you soon
