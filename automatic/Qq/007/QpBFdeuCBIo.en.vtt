00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
console which is I think that's a total

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.960 
console which is I think that's a total
waste<00:03:43.200> because<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.100> EA<00:03:44.370> doesn't<00:03:44.790> release

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
waste because I'm EA doesn't release

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.690 
waste because I'm EA doesn't release
that<00:03:45.180> many<00:03:45.390> games<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.989> year<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.560> 25<00:03:47.280> bucks<00:03:47.519> is
