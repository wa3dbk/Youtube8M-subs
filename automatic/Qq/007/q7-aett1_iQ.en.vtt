00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 here do not be alone interesting yes 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.120
 I know I take it, I'm very 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
 indignant at a condition that is 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
 treating the guild in this liberators of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 America 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 I want to talk to the viewer the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.950
 program is watching the program. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.269
 we live here in the Great Southern River in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 relation to our football the moment of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 end up complaining that it works more or 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.960
 least the next we played we found 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.960
 better than everyone but when we 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 we have to find ourselves the best and have a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 little self-esteem 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.760
 we just threw ourselves we got there 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 underneath I wanted to talk about the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930
 in America the liberators the guild has 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.329
 need for evolution has its 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
 problems because the team is not worse than 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 that 90% of the teams that dispute 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 Libertadores enters the guild 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 in this liberators of America as a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 of the competition title favorites 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 maybe two or three are better than 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 that the only good team that almost 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 never come, yes, we spend some time here 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.620
 so talking about the death group the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.129
 problem of the grÃªmio face the newell's 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 because they know that they probably 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.309
 are currently panicking for 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 facing the club because the club is the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 Team More Copeiro from Brazil 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 Portugal has blood running in the vein 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 because the great liberators of america 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is stronger than almost all 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100
 others 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 so if the guild has its problems 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 know that the great problem of others 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 is to have the guild in front of the liberators 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 of America will stop with this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 Portuguese chaining however 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.250
 liberators as one of the candidates for the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 title of the tired of coming out face so well 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.460
 how much is everyone giving sweat guild 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 will pass from the first phase when this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 your group 's first 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.439
 Abel liberators I so admire 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.590
 And I'm really sorry for what 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.780
 everything he says is true is based 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 This truth is true for a student of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.579
 frontally proposed school that creates the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.560
 not the liberators of the group alone. 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.689
 because it does not rank in the first 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.680
 The coast went wrong and I'm going to cheer. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.750
 to be wrong 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 come here to really tell the police 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.490
 the cake is right and what future 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.490
 revealing the bay
