process<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> basically<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.369> an<00:01:59.369> ingot

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
process this is a basically a an ingot

process this is a basically a an ingot
mold<00:01:59.729> cast<00:02:00.329> iron<00:02:00.740> okay<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
mold cast iron okay and you're going to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
mold cast iron okay and you're going to
put<00:02:03.329> vaseline<00:02:03.649> inside<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> already

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
put vaseline inside there I already

and then you're going to introduce the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.430 
and then you're going to introduce the
oxygen<00:02:59.980> always<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.360> map<00:03:01.570> gas<00:03:01.989> first

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
gas is always the yellow one that you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.160 
gas is always the yellow one that you
add<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.310> map<00:03:12.550> gas<00:03:12.850> first<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.540> then<00:03:13.660> open<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
add the map gas first and then open the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.650 
add the map gas first and then open the
oxygen<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.520> got<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> get<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> hang<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.510> do

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
oxygen you got to get the hang of it do

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.430 
oxygen you got to get the hang of it do
a<00:03:16.690> google<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.350> how<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> use<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> map<00:03:18.310> torch<00:03:19.440> now

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
a google on how to use a map torch now

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.289 
a google on how to use a map torch now
I'm<00:03:20.530> going<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.769> add<00:03:20.890> some<00:03:21.220> borax<00:03:21.670> as<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.120> can

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
I'm going to add some borax as you can

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.789 
I'm going to add some borax as you can
see<00:03:22.480> we're<00:03:22.690> getting<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.140> little<00:03:23.290> bit<00:03:23.500> melted

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
see we're getting a little bit melted

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.560 
see we're getting a little bit melted
which<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.760> pretty<00:03:25.200> pretty<00:03:26.200> intense<00:03:27.480> what<00:03:28.480> I'm

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
which is pretty pretty intense what I'm

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.390 
which is pretty pretty intense what I'm
going<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.840> do<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.140> add<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> little<00:03:29.440> borax<00:03:30.010> that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
going to do is add a little borax that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.110 
going to do is add a little borax that
way<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:32.739> will<00:03:32.890> get<00:03:33.040> rid<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.250> any<00:03:33.430> impurities

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
way it will get rid of any impurities

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.289 
way it will get rid of any impurities
you<00:03:34.840> want<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.170> do<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.880> after<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.000> start

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
you want to do that after you start

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.490 
you want to do that after you start
smelting<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:39.220> way<00:03:39.430> any<00:03:40.230> impurities<00:03:41.230> in

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
smelting that way any impurities in

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.039 
smelting that way any impurities in
there<00:03:41.739> we<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:43.180> we<00:03:43.420> just<00:03:43.750> lost<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.150> Matt<00:03:46.840> is

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
there we see we just lost the so Matt is

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.440 
there we see we just lost the so Matt is
going<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.350> turn<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.739> oxygen<00:03:47.920> off<00:03:48.430> first<00:03:48.910> which

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
going to turn the oxygen off first which

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.820 
going to turn the oxygen off first which
is<00:03:49.600> very<00:03:49.870> important<00:03:50.380> or<00:03:50.470> else<00:03:50.560> you're<00:03:50.709> going

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
is very important or else you're going

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.080 
is very important or else you're going
to<00:03:50.890> have<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.070> blowback<00:03:51.340> when<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.820> try<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
to have a blowback when you try to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.039 
to have a blowback when you try to
relight<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:53.560> let<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.430> sit<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.670> about

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
relight it and then let it sit for about

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.100 
relight it and then let it sit for about
30<00:03:56.049> seconds<00:03:56.530> as<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:57.100> see<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.459> is

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
30 seconds as you can see this is

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.830 
30 seconds as you can see this is
starting<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.459> come<00:04:00.459> out<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.239> hear<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.600> guys

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
starting to come out you hear that guys

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.670 
starting to come out you hear that guys
that's<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.890> sound<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.430> gold<00:04:04.410> doesn't<00:04:05.410> that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
that's the sound of gold doesn't that

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.360 
that's the sound of gold doesn't that
sound<00:04:05.860> nice<00:04:06.100> money<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> basic

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
sound nice money so this is the basic

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.610 
sound nice money so this is the basic
setup<00:04:09.579> if<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.880> want<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.150> smelt<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:10.780> own<00:04:11.200> gold

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
setup if you want to smelt your own gold

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.890 
setup if you want to smelt your own gold
the<00:04:12.549> gold<00:04:12.790> again<00:04:13.150> was<00:04:13.360> recovered<00:04:13.870> from

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
the gold again was recovered from

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.110 
the gold again was recovered from
computer<00:04:14.530> pieces<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.130> routers<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.549> cable

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
boxes if you get routers that's what

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.610 
boxes if you get routers that's what
you're<00:04:19.180> going<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.419> get<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:20.109> these<00:04:20.290> are<00:04:20.440> some

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
you're going to get so these are some

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
nice gold pins the computer has some

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.680 
nice gold pins the computer has some

parallel ports open them up you're going

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.350 
parallel ports open them up you're going
to<00:04:34.550> get<00:04:34.699> really<00:04:34.879> nice<00:04:35.120> gold<00:04:35.389> contacts<00:04:35.949> and

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
to get really nice gold contacts and

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.879 
to get really nice gold contacts and
watch<00:04:38.360> how<00:04:38.599> he<00:04:38.659> turns<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.470> map<00:04:39.680> gas<00:04:40.009> first<00:04:40.430> and

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
watch how he turns the map gas first and

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.890 
watch how he turns the map gas first and
then<00:04:42.889> he's<00:04:43.069> going<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.310> put<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:46.150> gas<00:04:47.150> on<00:04:47.419> very

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
then he's going to put the gas on very

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.230 
then he's going to put the gas on very
slightly<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.650> then<00:04:49.039> introduce<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.789> oxygen

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
slightly and then introduce the oxygen

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.700 
slightly and then introduce the oxygen
never<00:04:50.479> do<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> other<00:04:50.960> way<00:04:51.110> around<00:04:51.409> or<00:04:51.560> else

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
never do the other way around or else

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.050 
never do the other way around or else
you'll<00:04:51.919> end<00:04:52.069> up<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.490> hospital

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
you'll end up in the hospital

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.080 
you'll end up in the hospital
I<00:04:53.229> do<00:04:54.229> recommend<00:04:54.680> wearing<00:04:55.550> safety<00:04:55.729> glasses

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
I do recommend wearing safety glasses

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.499 
I do recommend wearing safety glasses
but<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.599> course<00:04:56.840> as<00:04:57.080> Matt<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:58.099> an<00:04:58.310> expert<00:04:58.819> he

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
but of course as Matt is an expert he

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.469 
but of course as Matt is an expert he
doesn't<00:04:59.900> believe<00:05:00.169> in<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.440> glasses<00:05:00.680> as<00:05:01.300> he<00:05:02.300> is

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
doesn't believe in the glasses as he is

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.680 
doesn't believe in the glasses as he is
very<00:05:03.440> confident<00:05:04.159> in<00:05:04.340> his<00:05:04.900> eyeball<00:05:05.900> skills<00:05:07.690> so

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
very confident in his eyeball skills so

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.129 
very confident in his eyeball skills so
watch<00:05:08.900> as<00:05:09.139> he<00:05:09.289> very<00:05:09.949> slowly<00:05:10.430> introduces<00:05:11.330> the

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
watch as he very slowly introduces the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.800 
watch as he very slowly introduces the
oxygen<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.919> oxygen<00:05:12.949> will<00:05:13.550> allow<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.330> map<00:05:14.539> gas

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
oxygen the oxygen will allow the map gas

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.749 
oxygen the oxygen will allow the map gas
to<00:05:15.050> work<00:05:15.289> more<00:05:15.500> efficiently<00:05:15.770> creating<00:05:16.610> that

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
to work more efficiently creating that

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.159 
to work more efficiently creating that
blue<00:05:17.240> flame<00:05:17.569> which<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.710> very<00:05:18.949> hot<00:05:20.169> flame

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
blue flame which is the very hot flame

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.740 
blue flame which is the very hot flame
which<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.860> reach<00:05:22.069> up<00:05:22.280> 2,000<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.330> 2,500

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
which can reach up 2,000 to 2,500

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.430 
which can reach up 2,000 to 2,500
degrees<00:05:25.449> Fahrenheit<00:05:26.449> and<00:05:26.659> if<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.110> get<00:05:27.319> it

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
degrees Fahrenheit and if you get it

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.379 
degrees Fahrenheit and if you get it
really<00:05:27.650> hot<00:05:27.979> it<00:05:28.190> can<00:05:28.310> go<00:05:28.430> up<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.729> 5,000<00:05:29.330> degrees

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
really hot it can go up to 5,000 degrees

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.149 
really hot it can go up to 5,000 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:05:30.020> which<00:05:30.169> can<00:05:30.349> melt<00:05:30.560> anything<00:05:30.860> from

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
Fahrenheit which can melt anything from

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.270 
Fahrenheit which can melt anything from
aluminum<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.669> steal<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.270> copper<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.860> silver

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
aluminum to steal the copper the silver

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:53.520 
aluminum to steal the copper the silver
and<00:05:34.460> gold<00:05:37.180> okay<00:05:38.180> so<00:05:38.240> here<00:05:38.690> we<00:05:38.810> go

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.980 

so<00:05:54.040> basically<00:05:54.430> I'm<00:05:54.700> going<00:05:54.760> to<00:05:54.970> let<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.270> cook

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
so basically I'm going to let it cook

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.450 
so basically I'm going to let it cook
for<00:05:56.020> a<00:05:56.290> while<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.770> way<00:05:56.980> you<00:05:57.040> don't<00:05:57.250> waste

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
for a while that way you don't waste

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.910 
for a while that way you don't waste
your<00:05:57.640> time<00:05:57.820> watching<00:05:58.090> it<00:05:58.450> happen<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.050> then

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
your time watching it happen and then

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.530 
your time watching it happen and then
I'm<00:06:00.070> going<00:06:00.220> to<00:06:00.310> create<00:06:00.610> another<00:06:00.670> video<00:06:01.120> right

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
I'm going to create another video right

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.740 
I'm going to create another video right
before<00:06:02.050> we're<00:06:02.530> about<00:06:02.710> to<00:06:02.950> pour<00:06:03.190> it<00:06:03.340> as<00:06:03.600> you<00:06:04.600> can

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
before we're about to pour it as you can

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.290 
before we're about to pour it as you can
see<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:04.960> little<00:06:05.170> green<00:06:05.500> flame<00:06:05.800> coming<00:06:06.070> out

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
see a little green flame coming out

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.340 
see a little green flame coming out
that's<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.540> copper<00:06:07.930> being<00:06:08.560> melted<00:06:08.980> out

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
that's the copper being melted out

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.540 
that's the copper being melted out
remember<00:06:11.350> you<00:06:11.440> want<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.710> put<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.890> little<00:06:12.070> borax

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
remember you want to put a little borax

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.320 
remember you want to put a little borax
as<00:06:12.760> well<00:06:12.940> to<00:06:13.180> make<00:06:13.330> sure<00:06:15.450> that<00:06:16.450> any<00:06:17.170> of<00:06:17.620> the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
as well to make sure that any of the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.890 
as well to make sure that any of the
impurities<00:06:21.030> get<00:06:22.030> melted<00:06:22.390> away<00:06:22.510> and<00:06:22.810> you're

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
impurities get melted away and you're

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.159 
impurities get melted away and you're
left<00:06:22.930> with<00:06:23.230> a<00:06:23.320> more<00:06:23.530> pure<00:06:23.740> ingot<00:06:24.870> alright<00:06:25.870> stay

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
left with a more pure ingot alright stay
