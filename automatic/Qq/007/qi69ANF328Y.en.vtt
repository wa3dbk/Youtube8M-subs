air today and I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> mod<00:00:05.609> called<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:06.569> floodgate<00:00:07.410> mod<00:00:07.649> today

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you a mod called the floodgate mod today

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.820 
you a mod called the floodgate mod today
now<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.360> was<00:00:09.630> created<00:00:09.900> by<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.200> same<00:00:10.320> guy<00:00:10.530> who

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
now this was created by the same guy who

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.629 
now this was created by the same guy who
created<00:00:12.080> modloader<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.160> ton<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.460> other

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
created modloader and a ton of other

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.220 
created modloader and a ton of other
mods<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.929> let's<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.500> started<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
mods so let's get started so here is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.130 
mods so let's get started so here is
I've<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.949> I've<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.850> water<00:00:21.210> running

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've got I've got some water running

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.790 
I've got I've got some water running
down<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:24.199> I've<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.650> different

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
down here and I've got two different

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.189 
down here and I've got two different
sets<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.310> water<00:00:26.550> I've<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> sauce<00:00:27.840> block

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
sets of water I've got the sauce block

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
sets of water I've got the sauce block
water<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.920> I've<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.490> some<00:00:29.670> flowing

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
water and I've just got some flowing

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.389 
water and I've just got some flowing
water<00:00:30.150> down<00:00:30.449> hammock<00:00:30.779> now<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.830> start<00:00:32.250> off

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
water down hammock now if we start off

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.139 
water down hammock now if we start off
by<00:00:32.610> me<00:00:33.480> showing<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.140> source<00:00:34.620> water<00:00:35.149> I'll

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
by me showing you the source water I'll

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
by me showing you the source water I'll
show<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> difference<00:00:37.110> between<00:00:37.380> what

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
show you the difference between what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.810 
show you the difference between what
piston<00:00:38.070> does<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> floodgate<00:00:40.710> does<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
piston does and what a floodgate does so

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
piston does and what a floodgate does so
if<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.329> observe<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.320> piston<00:00:43.739> does

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
if we just observe what this piston does

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
if we just observe what this piston does
now<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.510> piston<00:00:45.960> actually<00:00:46.469> shoots<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.930> new

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
now the piston actually shoots out a new

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
now the piston actually shoots out a new
sort<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> half<00:00:49.710> block<00:00:50.300> which<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
sort of half block which is what in this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.450 
sort of half block which is what in this
case<00:00:53.539> unlike<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.039> floodgate<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.219> actually

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
case unlike the floodgate which actually

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.869 
case unlike the floodgate which actually
creates<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> new<00:00:57.539> block<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:59.640> are

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
creates a new block now there are

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.840 
creates a new block now there are
differences<00:01:00.420> obviously<00:01:00.600> between<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.469> are

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
differences obviously between these are

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.210 
differences obviously between these are
advantages<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:04.290> were<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.769> create

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
advantages if you were to create

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
advantages if you were to create
something<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.729> wasn't<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.600> floodgate<00:01:06.930> for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
something that wasn't a floodgate for

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.649 
something that wasn't a floodgate for
example<00:01:07.830> something<00:01:08.729> maybe<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.659> pop-up<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
example something maybe like a pop-up a

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
example something maybe like a pop-up a
draw<00:01:12.659> butch<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.170> something<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
draw butch or something like that then I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.539 
draw butch or something like that then I
would<00:01:15.030> usually<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.580> floodgate

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
would usually go for the floodgate

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
would usually go for the floodgate
mainly<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.390> looks<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.290> nicer<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
mainly because it looks a lot nicer to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.990 
mainly because it looks a lot nicer to
walk<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:24.020> unlike<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.380> piston<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.340> looks

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
walk on unlike this piston which looks

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.719 
walk on unlike this piston which looks
while<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> whole<00:01:27.750> woods<00:01:27.960> walk<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> only

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
while the whole woods walk on the only

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.390 
while the whole woods walk on the only
downside<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.890> comes<00:01:32.250> with

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
downside of this is that it comes with

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.469 
downside of this is that it comes with
this<00:01:32.640> horrible<00:01:33.509> type<00:01:34.310> weird<00:01:35.310> sort<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> texture

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this horrible type weird sort of texture

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.069 
this horrible type weird sort of texture
hair<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.150> change<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.930> go

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
hair but you can change this if you go

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
hair but you can change this if you go
into<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> mod<00:01:40.560> phones<00:01:41.930> another<00:01:42.930> difference

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
into the mod phones another difference

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.359 
into the mod phones another difference
between<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:45.350> separate<00:01:46.350> eyes<00:01:46.619> things

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
between these two separate eyes things

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
between these two separate eyes things
despite<00:01:48.180> things<00:01:48.509> whatever<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> call

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
despite things whatever you want to call

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.240 
despite things whatever you want to call
them<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:50.450> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.200> notice<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> lever<00:01:52.950> here

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
them are if you notice the lever here

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.319 
them are if you notice the lever here
this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.170> position<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
this is actually on the on position of

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
this is actually on the on position of
position<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:58.049> position<00:01:58.619> whether<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:59.549> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
position on position whether well this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.789 
position on position whether well this
is<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.210> position<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
is in the off position now this is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
is in the off position now this is
another<00:02:02.159> advantage<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.540> means<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
another advantage because it means you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.210 
another advantage because it means you
can<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.170> them<00:02:05.990> floodgates<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> off<00:02:07.649> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
can have them floodgates on and off you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.550 
can have them floodgates on and off you
know<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> know<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.360> me<00:02:10.400> so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
know you could you know one me so

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.650 
know you could you know one me so
anyway<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.580> observe<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.660> one

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
anyway if we observe now what this one

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.900 
anyway if we observe now what this one
does<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:18.150> test<00:02:19.150> error<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.370> see

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
does in this test error if we just see

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.530 
does in this test error if we just see
what<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:23.050> going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.880> as<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.420> can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
what this is going to do so as you can

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.130 
what this is going to do so as you can
see<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.959> done<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> same<00:02:26.920> thing<00:02:27.480> again<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
see it's done the same thing again and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.110 
see it's done the same thing again and
it's<00:02:29.410> actually<00:02:29.800> just<00:02:29.980> stop<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.489> water<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.970> its

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it's actually just stop the water in its

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.979 
it's actually just stop the water in its
tracks<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.819> though<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.849> think<00:02:34.300> about<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.750> is

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
tracks so though I think about this is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.610 
tracks so though I think about this is
maybe<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:36.040> could<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> bit<00:02:36.910> ugly<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:38.410> that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
maybe that could be a bit ugly with that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.370 
maybe that could be a bit ugly with that
water<00:02:38.830> going<00:02:39.160> down<00:02:39.280> there<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.690> it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
water going down there but you know it

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.170 
water going down there but you know it
does<00:02:41.650> done<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> pretty<00:02:42.310> effective<00:02:42.519> job<00:02:43.150> of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
does done a pretty effective job of

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.590 
does done a pretty effective job of
stopping<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.989> water<00:02:45.120> ever<00:02:46.120> look<00:02:46.330> at<00:02:46.450> this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
stopping the water ever look at this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.259 
stopping the water ever look at this
 Alice<00:02:48.130> has<00:02:48.250> done<00:02:48.430> exactly<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.150> same

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
 Alice has done exactly the same

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.020 
 Alice has done exactly the same
thing<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:51.069> pretty<00:02:51.250> much<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.489> same<00:02:51.819> as

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
thing so it's pretty much the same as

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.660 
thing so it's pretty much the same as
last<00:02:52.060> time<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:53.200> does<00:02:53.560> look<00:02:53.830> slightly<00:02:54.370> nicer

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
last time it does look slightly nicer

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.120 
last time it does look slightly nicer
and<00:02:56.370> yeah<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.700> feel<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.260> mod<00:02:59.590> would<00:02:59.920> be

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and yeah I feel that this mod would be

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.559 
and yeah I feel that this mod would be
was<00:03:02.010> very<00:03:03.010> good<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.849> was<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.060> bit<00:03:04.299> like<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
was very good and it was a bit like the

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.500 
was very good and it was a bit like the
Pistons<00:03:05.019> mod<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:06.519> unfortunately<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.390> our

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
Pistons mod but unfortunately in our

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.660 
Pistons mod but unfortunately in our
Pistons<00:03:08.080> have<00:03:08.260> come<00:03:08.470> out<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.220> don't<00:03:09.519> think

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
Pistons have come out so I don't think

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.910 
Pistons have come out so I don't think
that<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.030> model<00:03:10.269> really<00:03:10.780> essential<00:03:11.530> anymore

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
that this model really essential anymore

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.949 
that this model really essential anymore
but<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:12.849> certainly<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.269> nice<00:03:13.390> mod<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.840> have

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
but it's certainly a nice mod to have

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.220 
but it's certainly a nice mod to have
around<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:14.860> very<00:03:14.950> easy<00:03:15.519> install<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230
