00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.609
 the nasa spitzer space telescope 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
 it was not designed to be a super-exoplanet detective 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.699
 but it has proven to be an amazing infrared detective tool 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.679
 spitzer has been due to the light of two distant worlds 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.859
 two planets outside of our solar system 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.580
 the resulting data called spectra 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.450
 reveals keys to his acts 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.060
 we seek to measure the thickness of the planet because we are told what 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.950
 molecules are present in the planet's atmosphere 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.690
 two different teams currently there are three different teams basically 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.490
 they found the first real spectrum of a planet around a star 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 different that is greatly distributed 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.550
 first sohail and a third team led by doctor jeremy 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.340
 richardson 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.569
 there were two planets h bielli tel the 94 58 thousand 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.670
 and hp and 18 97 33 of 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.310
 two hot jupiters oki gas tanks that orbit very close to your sun is a 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.310
 400 condit trillion kilometers from the earth 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630
 you will have heard the analogy that looking for a protective planet of a 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.730
 star is like looking at a firefly next to a light source 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.780
 this is a very good object and next to something extremely bright 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630
 so like the grains 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.170
 to tomás aspect is that we achieve this 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.400
 with referents and kirsanov its star we can not see the planet for a while 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.880
 that's when we pray about it that we 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.900
 others we take ntx of the spectrum that we take and mestizas 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 is when we know what the planet contributed 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.650
 Some astronomers predict that water could exist and to their surprise 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.650
 they found some indirect evidence that she their atmospheres 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.560
 it could be hidden under a layer of high clouds 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 if and in turn have a great choice these could darken atmosphere 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 of the planet the low atmosphere where the clear signature of the water could exist 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.210
 I think it's premature to say 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.430
 the doctor's team rejected I found some types of silicates 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.650
 some of the characteristics that we have seen in the spectrum could be 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.999
 indications of trade union unions are how the molecules are formed 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.019
 for simplicity and what not and psychically some metal 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.779
 and this means that there are clouds are very high in the atmosphere and that 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.169
 they could be made of grains deciding 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 basically dust grains 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.699
 cesc 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.119
 astronomers decipher the scheme of studying the two most planets in the 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:40.159
 future employ this technique in a handful of other planetary traffics 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.119
 that orbit stars beyond the solar system 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.159
 I think that lately this has been one of the great legacies of 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.769
 Spitzer Space Telescope 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.760
 unexpectedly after its release I think it will be 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.119
 extremely important in the future 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.639
 this is an important step for eventually studying signs of life 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.889
 gift of life could exist 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.429
 the habitable worlds which we hope to discover in a 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.529
 future 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.319
 the next step to answer the question 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 there is another land already outside 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.629
