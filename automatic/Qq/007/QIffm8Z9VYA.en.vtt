00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.260
 I do not want to do it one after the other 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.050
 for 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.640

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.460
 and good see you in a next video 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.119
 Take care 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.399
 good as I will start by placing a first 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.100
 especially my mobile eyelid and 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.550
 lower eyelashes or the eyelid 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.730
 lower and then I will place a base 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 white also by the eyelid 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.120
 lower and upper 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.120
 yes 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.129
 this is so that my shadows are more 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.269
 intense as I will use the color 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.400
 mint 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.400
 I want it to be quite intense 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.969
 the sky drink 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.780
 now I'm going to take a mint color 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 but before putting it back I'm going to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.849
 touch up the white base a bit and nothing 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 I'm going to blur it a little bit more 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.410
 taps so you can not see lines and 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.760
 Then I 'll put my shadow mint color 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.030
 taps with a flat broach on 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.130
 my mobile eyelid leaving a space in 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.600
 an external corner for the next 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.660
 color now I will take a peach color and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.640
 a brush to blur and place the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.450
 peach color on my basin to create 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.170
 a transition fund for the next 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.170
 shadow 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.120
 alan white hart lane city 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 singer 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 Now that I have the peach shadow I'm going 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.020
 to take a black shadow with a 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.209
 Flat brochita and in the external corner 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.480
 my eyelid would place 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.880
 tapping trying to keep it intense 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.820
 but at the same time that there is no line 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.530
 very marked between black and color 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.460
 mental 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.460
 I'm leaving with nothing tracy 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.320
 since I have the black shadow I will take a 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.740
 shadow color coffee with a broach 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.520
 pencil shape and I'll put it in the shape of 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.100
 b only to deposit it and then 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.950
 the blur 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.490
 rounded shape 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.760
 in small cuts to blur the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.760
 all right 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.160
 and if it is necessary clean the brush 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.270
 constantly if I feel that it is 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.400
 too much shadow to blur 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.040
 Blurs and cleanses blurred and clean for 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.040
 Make makeup cleaner 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.990
 Now with a chubby brush I'm going to take 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:29.030
 a clear shadow to illuminate the 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.520
 little bone of my eyebrows 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.520
 and also a little tear 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.620
 now with the same brown shadow and a 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.710
 flat skewer I will place the shadow 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.720
 coffee in the lower lashes 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.990
 blurring so you do not see a line 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.380
 very marked 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.380
 Yes Yes 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.430
 with a finite brochette I'm going to take the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.610
 same mint green illuminate a 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.670
 lacrimal little to make it look my 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.450
 more open eye 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.630
 also delineate my water line and my 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.540
 eyelid mobile with a liquid eyeliner 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.850
 I will put on a mask and I will now go without my 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.640
 makeup base because I do not have a base 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.050
 of makeup I started with the eyes and 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.050
 Now I 'm coming back with you 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.300

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.300

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.090

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:58.419

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.419

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.949
