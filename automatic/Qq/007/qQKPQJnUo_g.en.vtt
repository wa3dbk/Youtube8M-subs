00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.599
 There you go 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.810
 so today it's a fishing at 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.600
 platelet feeder at about 35 meters 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.670
 and a lot of wind there are waves is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.430
 always pretty hard to see and the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.949
 platelets are to these assumptions 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.940
 so I found a montage today 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.160
 that makes it possible to miss a little less 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 of keys that usually is hostage 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 a transfer it's a gallows 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.530
 reversed we did on a future by the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 shiny ones that slide freely between 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.259
 two stops the other effect actually settled 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.670
 the distance between the two stocks 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.259
 the hotel business but also the storm 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.050
 today what works well is 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:19.110
 a distance of about 5 cm a part 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.350
 not twisted swivel staples and a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.020
 small feeder five holes a little brennan 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.180
 where I like it because when 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.759
 woman she does as she left 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.800
 of a fielder plate tends to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 back up so they do not go to the front 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.380
 his life of getting the points is the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.760
 ball fitting today comes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.250
 snatch 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.420
 so it's hard to see a helmet 20 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 hundredths 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 about lee m 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 a ride to the velodrome but on the world 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 but in fact I am picked up 1 3 me 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.200
 book I have the press saying that's it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.409
 can today use if not spin 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 3 meters 30 an error feeder galvauder 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.790
 this year 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 on a carbon bone it's a quest that 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.700
 has adapted well to fish 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.000
 actually firefighters fish or 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000
 means 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.500
 we'll bend I'll say how that's 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.200
 comfortably up to forty 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.530
 meters 40 45 it starts a little bit 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.760
 conditions flexible enough to an action 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 will read parabolic at the earliest 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.940
 which makes it possible to use new 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 shopping these brakes and we have little risk 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 to get drinks 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 a 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.720
 ben here with the mounting bracket 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.740
 in difficult conditions a lot 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 wind waves 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.750
 a nice fishing bremen I invite you 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.650
 to try it and I hope you 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.650
 will take as much pleasure as me
