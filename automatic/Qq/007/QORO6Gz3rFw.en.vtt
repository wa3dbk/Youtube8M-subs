 where heads scary head find a handful 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.760
 mud of some clay incomprehensible stash 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.439
 stash 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:11.180
 still a bunch of garrison resources sit down and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.439
 we go further now our way lies in 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 more terrible place because she 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.430
 close to the toilet by the way the toilet is not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 forget to go give a achivka who suddenly 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.000
 did not go yet does not know this handful to find 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.009
 it was a little harder but I still 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.740
 I think that you have with my vidosy exactly that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.340
 it will turn out here it is vocal of a toilet 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.930
 heap we collect well and the last heap 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.250
 at least of those that are located 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.380
 Let us leaving us with very garrisons 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.310
 not far from him such camps have 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.960
 and here again we bump into an egg in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.329
 which also are the resources of the garrison 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.770
