00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
got fantastic chemistry I think every

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:43.959 
got fantastic chemistry I think every
single<00:04:43.159> one<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.280> them<00:04:43.430> players<00:04:43.669> will<00:04:43.849> be

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.779 
single one of them players will be
online<00:04:44.090> chem<00:04:44.539> which<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.900> kind<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.139> frustrating

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
online chem which is kind of frustrating

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.980 
online chem which is kind of frustrating
because<00:04:46.789> we<00:04:47.270> don't<00:04:47.509> really<00:04:47.719> have<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
because we don't really have the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.510 
because we don't really have the
greatest<00:04:48.349> of<00:04:48.500> chemistry<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.069> that<00:04:49.189> scored

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
greatest of chemistry and that scored

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520 
greatest of chemistry and that scored
it's<00:04:49.939> gone<00:04:50.120> like<00:04:50.240> has<00:04:50.419> Valdo<00:04:50.840> up<00:04:50.960> front<00:04:51.289> and

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
it's gone like has Valdo up front and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.200 
it's gone like has Valdo up front and
but<00:04:51.949> this<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.430> what<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.580> mean<00:04:52.729> about<00:04:52.789> Jojo

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
but this is what I mean about Jojo

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.640 
but this is what I mean about Jojo
kalyan<00:04:53.629> being<00:04:53.840> good<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.229> air<00:04:54.319> straight

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:01.929 
minute of his first game and you know I
don't<00:05:01.099> really<00:05:01.189> expect<00:05:01.460> her<00:05:01.610> because<00:05:01.819> he's

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
don't really expect her because he's

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.040 
don't really expect her because he's
kind<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.210> lucky<00:05:02.389> he's<00:05:02.629> not<00:05:02.659> really<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
kind of lucky he's not really the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.990 
kind of lucky he's not really the
tallest<00:05:03.379> of<00:05:03.439> players<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.919> he's<00:05:04.699> not<00:05:04.849> really

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
tallest of players and he's not really

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.189 
tallest of players and he's not really
the<00:05:05.090> strongest<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.479> players<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:05.930> was<00:05:06.050> pretty

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
the strongest of players so I was pretty

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.350 
the strongest of players so I was pretty
surprised<00:05:06.650> for<00:05:06.830> him<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.639> that<00:05:07.969> high

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
surprised for him to get up that high

really<00:05:23.719> do<00:05:23.840> feel<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:24.439> know<00:05:24.529> like<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.919> was<00:05:25.039> going

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
really do feel you know like I was going

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.459 
really do feel you know like I was going
to<00:05:25.219> get<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.430> 90th<00:05:25.759> minute<00:05:25.819> goal<00:05:26.150> but<00:05:26.360> we<00:05:27.289> don't

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
to get the 90th minute goal but we don't

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.119 
always get the lock on our hands and
that<00:05:29.300> is<00:05:29.419> how<00:05:29.599> FIFA<00:05:30.020> goes<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.560> roll<00:05:30.830> sometimes

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.800 
that is how FIFA goes and roll sometimes
but<00:05:31.669> there's<00:05:32.120> going<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.300> be<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.479> end<00:05:32.599> of<00:05:32.719> the

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810
