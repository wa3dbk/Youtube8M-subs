00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 It was an exhausting unit 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.990
 from Tuesday morning for Timo 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hildebrand and co in the hall without ten 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.519
 national player of 33 years and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.440
 Almost 400 professionals play in the most experienced 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.330
 royal blue squad turned the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 media after a clear 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 below-average weekend with 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 the topics analysis and processing if 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 Just the last ten minutes he 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 is very offensive necessarily try 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.189
 to win the game and then are 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.670
 unfortunately in the last few minutes in counter 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.050
 has gone processed 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.800
 It 's difficult but you have to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.320
 just tick off 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.190
 best no media newspaper internet 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.710
 Teletext or how hÃ¤ndel keep the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.950
 yes, after defeats is on everyone 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.930
 best case 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.250
 now it's still going on but half 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
 a lot of ten men are on the team 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.650
 what are you doing for something like that? 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.750
 discuss with the colleagues for that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.920
 can not stay unbroken 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.630
 but just be happy with them 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.220
 that were there but it is true 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.100
 have a meeting if all again 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.570
 there are 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.370
 I think that everything is generally 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.620
 that in the team at the moment 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.000
 a bit missing and where we just too 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.290
 I have to get back to my name 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 also experienced or shown 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:22.190
 phased against hannover the under 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 other and in the state you did 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 Are you experiencing that most 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.860
 Duties made on a high level 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.509
 how can you if you drove like that 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.940
 have ever experienced since you help 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.979
 can help but then only 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.180
 conditionally you can talk to the guys 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.360
 can also connect one but in the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.369
 The reason is simple, every single one 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.690
 question and just then the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.319
 focus on the sport on the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.340
 hide football and everything else 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.899
 next there are three 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 away tasks in a row the 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.289
 first only in Munich only one 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.990
 Team is not in good shape 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.069
 There are situations where you ever do 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.970
 hopeless in quotes where to go 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.380
 have driven and then something 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.459
 Did you remember that? 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.709
 maybe the boys maybe 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.610
 can entrain 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.260
 you can not play games small 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 Losing Munich's house of anticipation 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.540
 they have to mirror exactly like this if you are here 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.310
 actually against the rest also leads 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.750
 Everyone with a victory for Munich but 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.510
 That is perhaps our chance 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.770
 and maybe we can do that too 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.560
 to give with the power 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.130
 the human sunbathe a good fight from 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.240
 and just try to take something with you 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.830
 Overall, you would wish for one 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.870
 worth a little more on the defensive too 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.630
 lay 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.110
 a balance must be believed so 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.610
 sounds too easy gates too and easy 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.590
 just merciless version of our gate too 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.820
 defend and we just admit 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.820
 easy gates too
