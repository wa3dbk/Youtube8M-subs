Michael here withdrawing teachers calm
let's<00:00:02.970> draw<00:00:03.179> something<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.659> 3d<00:00:04.080> let's<00:00:04.770> take<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
let's draw something in 3d let's take a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.179 
let's draw something in 3d let's take a
cylinder<00:00:05.970> like<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> soup<00:00:06.750> can<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.410> let's<00:00:07.980> draw

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
cylinder like a soup can and let's draw

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.459 
cylinder like a soup can and let's draw
that<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.300> want<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.870> start<00:00:10.290> with

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
that what you want to do is start with

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:26.880 
that what you want to do is start with
an<00:00:10.830> oval<00:00:17.869> something<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.050> that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.710 

and<00:00:27.370> then<00:00:27.520> we're<00:00:27.640> going<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.820> come<00:00:28.000> down<00:00:28.300> for

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
and then we're going to come down for

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.430 
and then we're going to come down for
the<00:00:28.840> sides<00:00:29.110> like<00:00:30.070> here<00:00:30.340> in<00:00:30.400> here<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.410> sketch<00:00:32.410> a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
the sides like here in here so sketch a

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:40.229 
the sides like here in here so sketch a
line<00:00:32.710> downwards

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.150 

and<00:00:40.809> what<00:00:41.050> we<00:00:41.140> want<00:00:41.290> to<00:00:41.320> do<00:00:41.440> now<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:44.170> we<00:00:44.890> want<00:00:45.100> to

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
and what we want to do now is we want to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
and what we want to do now is we want to
match<00:00:45.460> that<00:00:46.059> curve<00:00:46.570> shape<00:00:47.020> down<00:00:47.680> here<00:00:48.309> okay<00:00:48.879> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
match that curve shape down here okay so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.080 
match that curve shape down here okay so
sometimes<00:00:50.739> help<00:00:51.100> destroy<00:00:51.519> yourself<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.910> line

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
sometimes help destroy yourself a line

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.049 
sometimes help destroy yourself a line
through<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:54.219> kind<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.430> help<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.820> match

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
through it there kind of help you match

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:03.660 
through it there kind of help you match
that<00:00:55.449> curve<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:01.059> copy<00:01:01.360> that<00:01:02.159> so<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.430> gives

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
that curve and copy that so that gives

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.060 
that curve and copy that so that gives
you<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.089> effect<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.720> perspective<00:01:04.930> on<00:01:05.560> a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
you the effect of perspective on a

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.280 
you the effect of perspective on a
cylinder<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.119> then<00:01:07.750> we<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.110> match<00:01:08.259> that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
cylinder and then we can match that

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.249 
cylinder and then we can match that
curve<00:01:08.649> again<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.340> draw<00:01:09.520> our<00:01:09.700> suit<00:01:10.030> label<00:01:13.259> again

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
curve again to draw our suit label again

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.919 
curve again to draw our suit label again
matching<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:14.950> same<00:01:15.250> curve<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:16.030> may<00:01:16.570> help<00:01:16.780> to

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
matching that same curve I may help to

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.260 
matching that same curve I may help to
give<00:01:17.110> yourself<00:01:17.470> some<00:01:17.560> marks<00:01:18.270> certain

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
give yourself some marks certain

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.889 
give yourself some marks certain
distance<00:01:19.630> from<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.899> top<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.350> bottom<00:01:23.700> alright

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
distance from the top and bottom alright

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.570 
distance from the top and bottom alright
so<00:01:25.899> now<00:01:26.140> we've<00:01:26.320> got<00:01:26.470> our<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.920> can<00:01:27.160> with<00:01:27.369> label

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
so now we've got our you can with label

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.790 
so now we've got our you can with label
let's<00:01:30.580> ink<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.289> I'll<00:01:32.289> show<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.649> couple

let's ink that in I'll show you a couple
other<00:01:33.009> neat<00:01:33.909> little<00:01:34.090> effects<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.750> can

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
other neat little effects that we can

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:44.790 
other neat little effects that we can
build<00:01:35.110> into<00:01:35.320> this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800

all<00:01:45.460> right<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> soup<00:01:48.970> can<00:01:49.240> very<00:01:49.750> often<00:01:49.990> has

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
all right now a soup can very often has

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.020 
all right now a soup can very often has
a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:53.590> metal<00:01:53.800> Ridge<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:57.310> here<00:01:57.370> so<00:01:57.790> we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
a little metal Ridge right here so we

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.680 
a little metal Ridge right here so we
just<00:01:58.060> need<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.480> copy<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:59.140> edge<00:01:59.440> again

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
just need to copy this edge again

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.930 
just need to copy this edge again
slightly<00:02:01.690> below<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.760> inside

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
slightly below it and then on the inside

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.440 
slightly below it and then on the inside
here<00:02:05.490> we're<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.700> draw<00:02:06.850> on<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.090> inside

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
here we're going to draw on the inside

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
here we're going to draw on the inside
here<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.980> show<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.400> little<00:02:09.760> lip<00:02:10.030> right<00:02:10.360> there

I'm going to do since this is we're
gonna<00:02:37.800> call<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> metallic<00:02:38.640> surface

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
gonna call this of a metallic surface

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.630 
gonna call this of a metallic surface
I'm<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.320> some<00:02:40.640> long

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
I'm just going to put some long

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm just going to put some long
striations<00:02:42.390> across<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.860> shade<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
striations across it and shade it a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.390 
striations across it and shade it a
little<00:02:44.430> more<00:02:44.640> over<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.060> side<00:02:46.400> since

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
little more over on this side since

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.830 
little more over on this side since
there's<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.700> lift<00:02:47.910> there<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:50.690> I'm<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
there's a lift there and I'm going to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.880 
there's a lift there and I'm going to
put<00:02:51.990> some<00:02:52.140> shading<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.950> sides<00:02:52.980> here<00:02:54.890> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
put some shading on the sides here to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.890 
put some shading on the sides here to
help<00:02:56.280> show<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.790> roundness<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.900> cans<00:02:58.790> and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
help show the roundness of this cans and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.330 
help show the roundness of this cans and
as<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.050> move<00:03:01.260> towards<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> center<00:03:01.860> I'm<00:03:02.160> going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
as I move towards the center I'm going

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.699 
as I move towards the center I'm going
to<00:03:02.430> open<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.690> spacing<00:03:04.230> between<00:03:04.350> those

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
to open up the spacing between those

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:13.070 
to open up the spacing between those
shading<00:03:05.160> lines

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.570 

and<00:03:13.620> I'm<00:03:13.740> gonna<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> same<00:03:14.160> thing<00:03:14.220> over

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
and I'm gonna do the same thing over

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.780 
and I'm gonna do the same thing over
here<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.650> start<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> edge<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.580> shake<00:03:17.760> it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
here and start on the edge and shake it

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.850 
here and start on the edge and shake it
a<00:03:17.880> couple<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.240> strokes<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:18.930> open<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
a couple of strokes and then open that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.920 
a couple of strokes and then open that
up<00:03:20.780> nope<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.140> feel<00:03:22.410> rounded<00:03:23.720> make<00:03:24.720> sure<00:03:24.900> I
