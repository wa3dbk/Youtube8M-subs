like nothing I've ever encountered

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.080 
like nothing I've ever encountered
before<00:00:45.740> it's<00:00:46.340> like<00:00:46.520> draw<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:48.110> visceral<00:00:49.090> it's

like uncompromising and complex but it's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.920 
like uncompromising and complex but it's
kind<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.220> it's<00:00:55.550> kind<00:00:55.700> of<00:00:55.820> simple<00:00:56.150> at<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.690> same

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
kind of it's kind of simple at the same

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.890 
kind of it's kind of simple at the same
time<00:00:57.880> just<00:00:58.880> like<00:00:59.090> it's<00:00:59.510> really<00:01:00.190> really<00:01:01.190> heavy

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
time just like it's really really heavy

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.649 
time just like it's really really heavy
and

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
and

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.410 
and
and<00:01:04.929> the<00:01:05.109> thing<00:01:05.289> is<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:06.030> most<00:01:07.030> people<00:01:07.329> would

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
and the thing is that most people would

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.550 
and the thing is that most people would
probably<00:01:07.450> think<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.289> pretty

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
probably think it's a pretty

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.830 
probably think it's a pretty
insignificant<00:01:09.039> part<00:01:09.850> since<00:01:10.299> it's<00:01:10.479> like<00:01:10.630> only

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
insignificant part since it's like only

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.919 
insignificant part since it's like only
like<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:12.009> line<00:01:12.249> but<00:01:12.939> but<00:01:13.420> seriously

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
like like one line but but seriously

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.709 
like like one line but but seriously
like<00:01:14.200> what<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.560> lie<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.939> like<00:01:16.090> there's<00:01:16.659> just

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719
