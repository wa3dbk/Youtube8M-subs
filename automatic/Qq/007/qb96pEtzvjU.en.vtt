give more depth of color where you feel
that<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.539> shading<00:01:36.960> would<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.289> each<00:01:37.770> time<00:01:38.039> I'm

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that the shading would be each time I'm

my<00:01:45.899> acrylic<00:01:46.229> bark<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> using<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> add

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
my acrylic bark and using this to add

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
my acrylic bark and using this to add
some<00:01:47.789> detail<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> areas<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> leaf

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
some detail to the areas of the leaf

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
some detail to the areas of the leaf
which<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.799> sunlight<00:01:50.159> might<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> hitting<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
which the sunlight might be hitting and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
which the sunlight might be hitting and
this<00:01:51.600> would<00:01:51.780> give<00:01:51.930> different<00:01:52.289> shadings<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this would give different shadings and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.099 
this would give different shadings and
colors<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.250> those<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> shadows<00:01:54.270> moving<00:01:54.990> on

I'm using the dark oatmeal marker to
color<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.049> branch<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.829> again<00:01:59.609> I<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.850> add

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
color in the branch and again I will add

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510
