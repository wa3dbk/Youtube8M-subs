the clamps two clamps actually I'll put
it<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.850> piece<00:02:14.850> I'm<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.290> cut<00:02:16.290> out<00:02:17.540> and

it on like a piece I'm gonna cut out and
then<00:02:18.660> I'll<00:02:18.840> cut<00:02:19.080> both<00:02:19.260> pieces<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.890> same

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
then I'll cut both pieces at the same

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.760 
then I'll cut both pieces at the same
time<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.300> looking<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.440> your

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
time so this is looking out for your

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.720 
time so this is looking out for your
side

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.809 

and<00:02:29.300> then<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.690> angle<00:02:30.590> here<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:33.819> parallel

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
and then this angle here is parallel

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.369 
and then this angle here is parallel
with<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.930> angle<00:02:36.379> up<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.739> top<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:39.019> when<00:02:39.200> this

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
with this angle up on top that when this

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.119 
with this angle up on top that when this
is<00:02:39.620> parallel<00:02:40.190> with<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.750> ground<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.769> this

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
is parallel with the ground I know this

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.720 
is parallel with the ground I know this
is<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.959> when<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> was<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.400> know<00:02:46.550> when

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
is so when I was you know I know when

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.600 
is so when I was you know I know when
the<00:02:46.819> bottom<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:48.519> well<00:02:49.519> I'll<00:02:49.640> know<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:52.519> know

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
the bottom is well I'll know it you know

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.270 
the bottom is well I'll know it you know
because<00:02:53.540> with<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.170> put<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.160> your

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
because with you if you put in your

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.789 
because with you if you put in your
bucket<00:02:55.640> down<00:02:55.670> into<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> ground<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:57.319> wants<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
bucket down into the ground it wants to

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.479 
bucket down into the ground it wants to
hop<00:02:58.390> along<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.720> skip<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.980> way<00:03:01.220> they'll

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
hop along and skip this way they'll

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.240 
hop along and skip this way they'll
grade<00:03:01.700> off<00:03:01.940> maybe<00:03:02.239> only<00:03:02.510> an<00:03:02.690> inch<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.140> time

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
grade off maybe only an inch at a time

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.240 
grade off maybe only an inch at a time
and<00:03:04.250> by<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.819> time<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.750> come<00:03:05.989> across<00:03:06.260> we

go maybe five six feet your buckets full
so<00:03:11.380> you<00:03:12.380> know<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.680> not<00:03:12.769> like<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.010> had<00:03:13.130> to

working<00:03:14.780> their<00:03:15.079> way<00:03:15.110> down<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.739> keeps<00:03:15.950> it

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
working their way down and that keeps it

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.430 
working their way down and that keeps it
nice<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.459> love<00:03:16.670> it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
four pieces together I didn't want to

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.680 
four pieces together I didn't want to
cut<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.370> got<00:03:30.820> something<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.210> cut<00:03:31.390> ahead<00:03:31.510> I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690

want<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.230> cut<00:03:32.410> more<00:03:32.680> than<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.040> because<00:03:33.280> uh

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.090 

you<00:03:37.840> may<00:03:37.990> start<00:03:38.260> shrinking<00:03:38.530> they<00:03:38.830> start

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
you may start shrinking they start

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.670 
you may start shrinking they start
growing<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.490> little<00:03:39.610> bit<00:03:40.530> well<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.440> far

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
growing a little bit well but so far

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.900 
growing a little bit well but so far
pretty<00:03:44.950> satisfy<00:03:45.580> with<00:03:45.760> it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.230 

it's<00:03:52.390> thicker<00:03:52.750> than<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.140> old<00:03:53.320> bucket<00:03:54.240> it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
it's thicker than the old bucket it

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's thicker than the old bucket it
should<00:03:55.450> be<00:03:55.570> alright

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
should be alright

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.190 
should be alright

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
plus I'm gonna do some reinforcement

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.610 
plus I'm gonna do some reinforcement
