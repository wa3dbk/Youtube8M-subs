00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
 ah 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.350
 for the next craft we are going to 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
 need decorative or family foamy 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.760
 ill silicon and so let's make use of 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.160
 these rings 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.350
 which are ring bases to start 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
 let's take our rule and let's 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.930
 measure a strip of 17 in our foami 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.700
 centimeters 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.230
 once we have cut our strip 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.870
 of different centimeters we are going to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.620
 fold it half and we're going to press 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.160
 strong and let's take our scissors and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.950
 let's highlight the line marked with 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.620
 our tip of the scissors but that 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.379
 something like that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 so that it folds easily and we're going to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.200
 take from one end and let's put 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.910
 silicone 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.110
 and we're going to start rolling 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.110
 little by little 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.200
 ours for me 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.660
 leaving a small space before 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.720
 get at least one centimeter before 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.740
 to reach the limit of the line we have 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 marked the center 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.230
 so that we have something like that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 and on the other end we're going to do what 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.720
 same 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.910
 we mark this side 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.910
 with the silicon and we're winding 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.050
 and more or less at the same height as the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.640
 other 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.640
 let's put silicone 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.620
 in this way once we have something 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.200
 more or less like that 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.890
 we're going to put silicon at the center between 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.730
 both in this way let's put 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.730
 silicone here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.850
 and we're going to hit it with the other one of this 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.850
 shape 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.020
 and we are going to mark well by crushing the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.020
 line is 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.620
 we take off the leftover foami 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 in this way once we have something 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.490
 more or less like that we can catch 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.610
 volley 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.450
 and we are going to mark a little little heart 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 the same size 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.489
 what is it that we have done 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.230
 and now we cut it once we have 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.320
 something like this and we have already 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.910
 out the exact mold of our heart 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.240
 let's take the silicone and we're going to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.240
 paste 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.850
 in this way we take the mold that we have 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.330
 done and we'll fit it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 with that attitude so that they do not remain very 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.750
 subtracted this excess silicone or anything 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.830
 in this way we have to give something more 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.730
 or less so on the other side of this we're going 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.930
 to put a silicone ball 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.920
 more or less large 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.380
 and we are going to take our ring 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.550
 and we're going to hit it this way 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.550
 but more straight possible 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.430
 and we are going to crush it 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.050
 and we're going to let it dry a while and a 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.890
 Once it has dried, there will be something more 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.890
 or less so 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.629
 what is a very nice detail for 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.019
 give away and here I have others that I made 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.019
 before 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.860
 they are very beautiful the truth 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.030
 a little bigger but it's just like what 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.620
 what we have done now 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.420
 that way our 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.920
 craft so we'll see you until the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.920
 next video chao
