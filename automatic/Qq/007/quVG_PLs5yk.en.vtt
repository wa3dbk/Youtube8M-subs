 November 30, 10:43 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.500
 Bright sunny day, innocent people. A truck is approaching the western entrance. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.000
 10: 45 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 We can not do anything about it. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.100
 This is the highest-profile trial in Britain's history. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.900
 You and Mrs. Howell defend the accused terrorist against the government. 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.300
 And you are from the New York Times. I'm not talking to journalists 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.700
 on trials involving national security issues. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.400
 Are you aware of any reason that would hinder your ability to perform the case? 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900
 No, sir. 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.100
 No, no reason. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.600
 There is some evidence against you, which criminal prosecution believes should remain hidden from the public and from you. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.600
 You broke my chamber. 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.100
 I think you are wrong. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.500
 Our clones use us. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.570
 In 6 months our client went from a taxi to a new Mercedes. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.020
 He spent 2,000 a week. Where did that money come from? 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.400
 The English brought him as a double agent. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.600
 It is supposed to lead them to the terrorist nucleus before the attack. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 And there they went all wrong. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 Prior to the bombing, there was no contact between MI5 and the defendant. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.400
 Defense advocates asking many questions are consumable. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000
 There are half a million closed-circuit cameras in London. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 Certainly some of us are watching at this time. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 There are people who really want condemnation. 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.100
 You had to keep your mouth shut. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.820
 MI5 does not kill people so simply. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.200
 - Where the fuck are you in? - We simply try to defend our client. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 Leave the bag. Leave it all. Get out of here now. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 There are forces in the game ... 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.900
 which neither you nor I can hope to control.
