00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.260 

in<00:00:22.240> this<00:00:23.240> demo<00:00:23.660> video<00:00:23.990> for<00:00:24.650> AutoCAD<00:00:25.220> I<00:00:25.760> would

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
in this demo video for AutoCAD I would

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.960 
in this demo video for AutoCAD I would
like<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.630> go<00:00:26.750> over<00:00:26.780> how<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.410> create<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.550> drawing

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
like to go over how to create a drawing

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.750 
like to go over how to create a drawing
like<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:30.200> is<00:00:30.260> going<00:00:30.530> to<00:00:30.620> be<00:00:30.800> using

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
like this and this is going to be using

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.910 
like this and this is going to be using
a<00:00:31.910> combination<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.660> some<00:00:33.320> of<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.500> basic

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
a combination of some of the basic

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.650 
a combination of some of the basic
concepts<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.880> I've<00:00:34.970> covered<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.480> few

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
concepts that I've covered in a few

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.630 
concepts that I've covered in a few
previous<00:00:35.960> videos<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:36.710> we'll<00:00:37.190> be<00:00:37.250> using

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
previous videos so we'll be using

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.270 
previous videos so we'll be using
circles<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.780> lines<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.320> join<00:00:39.620> things<00:00:40.100> like

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
circles and lines and join things like

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.370 
circles and lines and join things like
that<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.790> then<00:00:41.239> using<00:00:41.570> commands<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.020> copy

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
that and then using commands like copy

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.600 
that and then using commands like copy
at<00:00:42.680> specific<00:00:43.220> distances<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:44.660> them<00:00:45.610> equal

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
at specific distances to get them equal

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.520 
at specific distances to get them equal
distant<00:00:46.910> apart<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:47.720> use<00:00:48.170> some

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
distant apart and then use some

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.950 
distant apart and then use some
different<00:00:48.920> hatching<00:00:49.280> techniques<00:00:49.900> so<00:00:50.900> I'm

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
different hatching techniques so I'm

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.570 
different hatching techniques so I'm
just<00:00:51.080> going<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.290> move<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.739> off<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.430> side

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
just going to move that off to the side

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.300 
just going to move that off to the side
and<00:00:53.360> I'm<00:00:54.320> going<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:54.560> come<00:00:54.740> up<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.010> grab<00:00:55.250> the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
and I'm going to come up and grab the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.840 
and I'm going to come up and grab the
circle<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.240> I'm<00:00:56.300> using<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.690> center<00:00:57.080> radius

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
circle and I'm using the center radius

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.150 
circle and I'm using the center radius
so<00:00:58.850> I'll<00:00:58.940> select<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.630> I<00:01:00.350> could<00:01:00.740> just<00:01:00.950> use

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
so I'll select that and I could just use

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.970 
so I'll select that and I could just use
a<00:01:01.540> object<00:01:02.540> snap<00:01:02.750> tracking<00:01:02.960> here<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.770> line

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
a object snap tracking here to line

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.390 
a object snap tracking here to line
these<00:01:04.190> up<00:01:04.630> keep<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.780> kind<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.020> neat<00:01:06.250> alright

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
these up keep it kind of neat alright

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.160 
these up keep it kind of neat alright
and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:08.180> I'll<00:01:08.450> based<00:01:08.720> on<00:01:08.869> my<00:01:08.960> measurements

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and then I'll based on my measurements

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.050 
and then I'll based on my measurements
here<00:01:09.830> since<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:10.369> has<00:01:10.550> an<00:01:10.670> eight-foot

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
here since this has an eight-foot

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.150 
here since this has an eight-foot
diameter<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.869> will<00:01:12.110> do<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.580> 4-foot<00:01:13.580> radius<00:01:15.160> okay

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
diameter I will do a 4-foot radius okay

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.600 
diameter I will do a 4-foot radius okay
and<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:17.330> within<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:18.740> see<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.160> we<00:01:19.340> have

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
and then within that we see that we have

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.590 
and then within that we see that we have
a<00:01:19.850> four<00:01:20.479> foot<00:01:20.810> by<00:01:20.990> four<00:01:21.290> foot<00:01:21.320> square<00:01:22.600> so

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
a four foot by four foot square so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.900 
a four foot by four foot square so
there's<00:01:23.990> no<00:01:24.110> different<00:01:24.649> ways<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:25.009> do<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.490> but

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
there's no different ways to do this but

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.790 
there's no different ways to do this but
just<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.660> terms<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:27.050> thinking<00:01:27.200> about<00:01:27.440> how<00:01:27.740> to

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
just in terms of thinking about how to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.779 
just in terms of thinking about how to
line<00:01:28.310> things<00:01:28.580> up<00:01:29.110> one<00:01:30.110> way<00:01:30.289> would<00:01:30.560> be<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.800> draw

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
line things up one way would be to draw

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.210 
line things up one way would be to draw
it<00:01:31.850> on<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.240> outside<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.600> four<00:01:35.960> feet<00:01:36.350> by<00:01:37.190> four

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
it on the outside so four feet by four

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.169 
it on the outside so four feet by four
feet<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:40.179> I'll<00:01:41.179> do<00:01:41.330> see<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.780> clothes<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:43.179> you

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
feet and I'll do see for clothes and you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.690 
feet and I'll do see for clothes and you
know<00:01:44.300> then<00:01:44.479> we<00:01:44.569> could<00:01:44.690> simply<00:01:45.020> give<00:01:45.229> ourselves

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
know then we could simply give ourselves

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.840 
know then we could simply give ourselves
a<00:01:47.140> guideline<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.470> middle<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.580> when

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
a guideline in the middle so that when

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.199 
a guideline in the middle so that when
we<00:01:50.030> use<00:01:50.240> move<00:01:51.490> select<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.910> objects<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:55.209> move

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
we use move select the objects and move

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.210 
we use move select the objects and move
from<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.600> midpoint<00:01:56.929> it's<00:01:57.410> really<00:01:57.830> easy<00:01:58.039> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
from this midpoint it's really easy to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.730 
from this midpoint it's really easy to
Center<00:01:58.850> inside<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.660> circle<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.590> just

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
Center inside of the circle so it's just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.040 
Center inside of the circle so it's just
using<00:02:00.890> move<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.550> grabbing<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.479> guideline

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
using move and grabbing that guideline

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.270 
using move and grabbing that guideline
which<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.069> delete<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:06.009> same<00:02:07.009> thing

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
which I can now delete the same thing

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.270 
which I can now delete the same thing
will<00:02:07.369> be<00:02:07.399> true<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.479> triangle<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:10.099> I'll

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
will be true for this triangle so I'll

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.210 
will be true for this triangle so I'll
use<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:11.260> simple<00:02:12.260> line<00:02:12.709> this<00:02:12.980> time<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:15.069> I'll<00:02:16.069> do

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
use a simple line this time and I'll do

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.140 
use a simple line this time and I'll do
a<00:02:16.250> horizontal<00:02:16.610> line<00:02:17.120> at<00:02:17.450> 24<00:02:18.349> inches<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.150> I'll

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
a horizontal line at 24 inches and I'll

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
a horizontal line at 24 inches and I'll
hit<00:02:20.330> enter<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:20.900> out<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.230> command<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
hit enter to get out of that command and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.330 
hit enter to get out of that command and
enter<00:02:22.700> again<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.209> start<00:02:23.540> line<00:02:23.720> over<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:25.099> I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
enter again to start line over then I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.240 
enter again to start line over then I
will<00:02:25.580> come<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.209> from<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.780> midpoint<00:02:27.250> straight

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
will come up from this midpoint straight

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.690 
will come up from this midpoint straight
up

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
up

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.309 
up
24<00:02:29.510> inches<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:31.329> then<00:02:32.329> I'll<00:02:32.450> use<00:02:32.659> lines<00:02:33.019> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
24 inches and then I'll use lines to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.339 
24 inches and then I'll use lines to
just<00:02:33.530> connect

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
just connect

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.399 
just connect
those<00:02:34.590> two<00:02:34.950> corners<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.959> now<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.230> move

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
those two corners and now I can move

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.660 
those two corners and now I can move
this<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.430> well<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.659> I'll<00:02:39.749> use<00:02:39.900> move<00:02:40.670> select

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this in as well so I'll use move select

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.489 
this in as well so I'll use move select
it<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:41.969> hit<00:02:42.870> enter

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
it all hit enter

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.459 
it all hit enter
grab<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.370> midpoint<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:44.999> this<00:02:45.150> line<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.719> I

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
grab the midpoint of this line and I

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.309 
grab the midpoint of this line and I
could<00:02:46.829> Center<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:47.939> circle<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.109> just

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
could Center it in the circle you just

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.990 
could Center it in the circle you just
got<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.799> move<00:02:49.980> around<00:02:50.159> a<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.519> bit<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.909> get

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
got to move around a little bit to get

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.030 
got to move around a little bit to get
in<00:02:51.150> there<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.569> now<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.319> have<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.680> centered

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
in there and now we have that centered

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.580 
in there and now we have that centered
in<00:02:53.159> there<00:02:53.280> nicely<00:02:53.459> at<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.629> point<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.170> can

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
in there nicely at that point I can

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.830 
in there nicely at that point I can
delete<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.340> guideline<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.540> could<00:02:57.689> even

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
delete that guideline and I could even

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.569 
delete that guideline and I could even
join<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.409> together

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
join this together

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.039 
join this together
it's<00:02:59.790> not<00:02:59.969> as<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.329> would<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.989> to

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
it's not as if I would really have to

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.940 
it's not as if I would really have to
but<00:03:01.799> it's<00:03:01.919> kind<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.489> nice<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.859> in

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
but it's kind of nice just you know in

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.190 
but it's kind of nice just you know in
terms<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.310> having<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.700> clean<00:03:05.969> drawing<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.959> do

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
terms of having a clean drawing to do

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.610 
terms of having a clean drawing to do
that<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.769> can<00:03:07.950> use<00:03:08.569> join<00:03:09.569> out<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.139> modify

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that we can use join out of the modify

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.649 
that we can use join out of the modify

two arrows pointing at each other you

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.309 
two arrows pointing at each other you
could<00:03:14.730> always<00:03:14.969> type<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.299> J<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.780> join<00:03:15.959> as<00:03:16.169> well

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
could always type in J for join as well

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.580 
could always type in J for join as well
I'll<00:03:16.680> select<00:03:17.609> these<00:03:17.790> three<00:03:18.060> lines<00:03:18.299> hit<00:03:19.230> enter

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
I'll select these three lines hit enter

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.140 
I'll select these three lines hit enter
and<00:03:20.060> now<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.269> polyline<00:03:22.669> now<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:23.879> have

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
and now it's a polyline now that I have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.959 
and now it's a polyline now that I have
all<00:03:24.389> three<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.500> these<00:03:25.709> shapes<00:03:26.189> nested

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:26.969 
all three of these shapes nested

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:27.679 
all three of these shapes nested
together

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
together

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.770 
together
I<00:03:27.719> can<00:03:28.379> copy<00:03:28.919> them<00:03:29.250> specific<00:03:30.180> distances<00:03:30.659> apart

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
I can copy them specific distances apart

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.949 
I can copy them specific distances apart
so<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.739> see<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.340> once<00:03:32.790> again<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.269> eight<00:03:33.449> feet

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
so I see that once again it's eight feet

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.500 
so I see that once again it's eight feet
across<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.040> circle<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.609> foot<00:03:35.849> diameter<00:03:36.000> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
across the circle a foot diameter and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.399 
across the circle a foot diameter and
then<00:03:36.959> two<00:03:37.379> feet<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:37.949> between<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.109> want<00:03:40.319> to

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
then two feet in between so if I want to

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.319 
then two feet in between so if I want to
use<00:03:40.620> copy<00:03:41.009> I'll<00:03:41.870> select<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:43.199> three<00:03:43.620> at<00:03:43.739> once

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
use copy I'll select all three at once

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.899 
use copy I'll select all three at once
hit<00:03:45.329> enter<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.019> now<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.530> need<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.949> pick<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.489> base

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
hit enter and now I need to pick a base

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.080 
hit enter and now I need to pick a base
point<00:03:48.239> I'm<00:03:48.599> going<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.109> grab<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:50.370> left

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
point I'm going to grab this left

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.599 
point I'm going to grab this left
quadrant<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.319> remember<00:03:52.799> that's<00:03:52.919> with<00:03:53.159> object

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
quadrant and remember that's with object

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.789 
quadrant and remember that's with object
snap<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.329> if<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.659> don't<00:03:54.870> have<00:03:55.139> quadrant

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
snap on and if you don't have quadrant

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.920 
snap on and if you don't have quadrant
you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.669> simply<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.299> click<00:03:57.629> on<00:03:57.870> your

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
you can simply right click on your

you can simply right click on your
object<00:03:58.379> snap<00:03:58.829> settings<00:03:59.189> at<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.400> bottom<00:03:59.430> of

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
object snap settings at the bottom of

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.330 
object snap settings at the bottom of
the<00:03:59.819> screen<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.560> grab<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.739> quadrant<00:04:02.250> right

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
the screen and grab that quadrant right

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.149 
the screen and grab that quadrant right
there<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.519> again

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
there do that again

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.670 
there do that again
grabbing<00:04:08.159> that<00:04:08.250> point<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.849> now<00:04:09.329> I'll<00:04:09.509> just

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
grabbing that point and now I'll just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.830 
grabbing that point and now I'll just
slide<00:04:10.680> my<00:04:10.709> mouse<00:04:10.949> over<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:11.909> I<00:04:12.329> can<00:04:12.479> type<00:04:12.659> in

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
slide my mouse over and I can type in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.259 
slide my mouse over and I can type in
the<00:04:12.930> measurements<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.129> if<00:04:14.430> my<00:04:14.579> circles<00:04:15.090> eight

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
the measurements so if my circles eight

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.180 
the measurements so if my circles eight
feet<00:04:15.479> across<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.289> want<00:04:16.530> there<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:16.889> a

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
feet across and I want there to be a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.640 
feet across and I want there to be a
2-foot<00:04:17.849> gap<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.329> between<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.959> need<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.259> type<00:04:19.469> in

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
2-foot gap in between I need to type in

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.589 
2-foot gap in between I need to type in
10<00:04:20.159> feet<00:04:21.440> enter<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.740> now<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:23.729> see<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.150> that's

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
10 feet enter and now we see that that's

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.170 
10 feet enter and now we see that that's
the<00:04:25.320> two<00:04:25.500> feet<00:04:25.770> distance<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.250> between<00:04:26.580> so<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the two feet distance in between so to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.709 
the two feet distance in between so to
do<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.479> again<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.289> would<00:04:28.380> now<00:04:28.830> do<00:04:29.060> 20<00:04:30.060> feet

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
do this again I would now do 20 feet

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.379 
do this again I would now do 20 feet
enter<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.280> could<00:04:32.460> continue<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.270> way

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
enter and I could continue on that way

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.939 
enter and I could continue on that way
so<00:04:33.960> if<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.110> just<00:04:34.259> hit<00:04:34.380> enter<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.740> end<00:04:34.830> that

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
so if I just hit enter to end that

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.740 
so if I just hit enter to end that
command<00:04:35.340> you'll<00:04:35.849> see<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.180> we<00:04:36.300> have<00:04:36.330> these

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
command you'll see that we have these

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.510 
command you'll see that we have these
three<00:04:37.169> circles<00:04:37.500> all<00:04:37.889> neatly<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.370> row<00:04:38.490> just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
three circles all neatly in a row just

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
three circles all neatly in a row just
like<00:04:38.880> we<00:04:39.120> do<00:04:39.240> over<00:04:39.419> here<00:04:39.889> now<00:04:40.889> how<00:04:41.130> do<00:04:41.190> we<00:04:41.280> do

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
like we do over here now how do we do

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.089 
like we do over here now how do we do
these<00:04:42.750> diagonal<00:04:43.650> lines

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
these diagonal lines

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.690 
these diagonal lines
that's<00:04:44.460> simply<00:04:45.060> using<00:04:45.419> hatching<00:04:46.520> so

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
that's simply using hatching so

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.850 
that's simply using hatching so
to<00:04:47.790> get<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> hatching<00:04:48.840> we're<00:04:49.380> going<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> go

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
to get to the hatching we're going to go

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.950 
to get to the hatching we're going to go
up<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.190> Home<00:04:50.400> tab<00:04:50.670> in<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.000> draw<00:04:51.210> panel<00:04:51.510> and

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
up to the Home tab in the draw panel and

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.900 
up to the Home tab in the draw panel and
we're<00:04:52.800> looking<00:04:53.040> for<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.370> button<00:04:53.700> right<00:04:53.730> here

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
we're looking for this button right here

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.950 
we're looking for this button right here
hatch<00:04:55.220> once<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.370> get<00:04:56.490> into<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:56.880> menu<00:04:57.420> you'll

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
hatch once we get into that menu you'll

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.120 
hatch once we get into that menu you'll
see<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.290> we<00:04:58.380> have<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.530> lot<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.800> options

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
see that we have a lot of options

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.450 
see that we have a lot of options
between<00:04:59.580> solid<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.390> angles<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.560> there's<00:05:02.310> all

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
between solid and angles and there's all

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.130 
between solid and angles and there's all
sorts<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.000> brick<00:05:03.330> patterns<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.900> things<00:05:04.020> we

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
sorts of brick patterns and things we

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.550 
sorts of brick patterns and things we
can<00:05:04.290> pick<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:05.070> I'm<00:05:05.220> just<00:05:05.430> using<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.960> basic

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
can pick so I'm just using this basic

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.520 
can pick so I'm just using this basic
one<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.920> NSI<00:05:08.550> 31<00:05:09.150> all<00:05:10.050> right<00:05:10.170> so<00:05:10.290> I'll<00:05:10.350> pick

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
one the NSI 31 all right so I'll pick

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.940 
one the NSI 31 all right so I'll pick
that<00:05:10.560> one<00:05:10.920> and<00:05:12.170> you'll<00:05:13.170> have<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.560> play<00:05:13.740> around

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
that one and you'll have to play around

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.620 
that one and you'll have to play around
with<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.250> scale<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> little<00:05:14.880> bit<00:05:15.030> so<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.480> always

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
with the scale a little bit so it always

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.410 
with the scale a little bit so it always
defaults<00:05:16.200> at<00:05:16.350> one<00:05:16.650> well<00:05:17.370> what<00:05:17.580> happens<00:05:18.090> if<00:05:18.300> I

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
defaults at one well what happens if I

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.060 
defaults at one well what happens if I
come<00:05:18.630> over<00:05:18.660> here<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:18.990> say<00:05:19.110> pick<00:05:19.320> points<00:05:19.860> and

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
come over here and say pick points and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.390 
come over here and say pick points and
hover<00:05:20.940> when<00:05:21.660> something's<00:05:22.140> at<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.410> very<00:05:23.310> small

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
hover when something's at a very small

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.240 
hover when something's at a very small
scale<00:05:23.700> it'll<00:05:24.360> look<00:05:24.480> super<00:05:24.990> super<00:05:25.170> tight<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.160> if

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
scale it'll look super super tight so if

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.760 
scale it'll look super super tight so if
I<00:05:26.340> click<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.910> there<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.390> just<00:05:27.900> hit<00:05:28.170> enter<00:05:28.350> to

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
I click in there and just hit enter to

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.950 
I click in there and just hit enter to
end<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.130> hatching<00:05:29.580> command<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.090> looks<00:05:30.660> solid

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
end the hatching command it looks solid

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.860 
end the hatching command it looks solid
it<00:05:31.380> doesn't<00:05:31.440> look<00:05:32.280> like<00:05:32.310> this<00:05:32.700> over<00:05:33.000> here<00:05:33.030> so

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
it doesn't look like this over here so

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.930 
it doesn't look like this over here so
even<00:05:34.230> if<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.500> know<00:05:34.830> get<00:05:35.010> real<00:05:35.280> close<00:05:35.610> you'll

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
even if I you know get real close you'll

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.060 
even if I you know get real close you'll
see<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.180> okay<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.080> actually<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.530> hatching

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
see that okay it actually is a hatching

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.960 
see that okay it actually is a hatching
pattern<00:05:38.430> it's<00:05:38.580> just<00:05:38.790> really<00:05:39.120> really<00:05:39.600> dense<00:05:40.970> so

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
pattern it's just really really dense so

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.030 
pattern it's just really really dense so
I'm<00:05:42.030> going<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> click<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.480> that<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:42.990> this<00:05:43.770> time

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
I'm going to click on that and this time

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.560 
I'm going to click on that and this time
I'll<00:05:44.190> come<00:05:44.370> up<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:44.790> scale<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.120> I'll<00:05:45.420> try

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
I'll come up to the scale and I'll try

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.490 
I'll come up to the scale and I'll try
something<00:05:45.960> like<00:05:46.170> maybe<00:05:46.620> 20<00:05:47.040> or<00:05:47.310> 30<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.410> have

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
something like maybe 20 or 30 so I have

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.850 
something like maybe 20 or 30 so I have
20<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:51.510> can<00:05:51.690> close<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.080> hatch<00:05:52.230> editor<00:05:52.650> and

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
20 and I can close the hatch editor and

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.780 
20 and I can close the hatch editor and
that<00:05:53.700> looks<00:05:53.970> much<00:05:54.390> better

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
that looks much better

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.900 
that looks much better
so<00:05:56.790> we<00:05:56.970> see<00:05:57.240> that<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.840> get<00:05:58.170> into<00:05:58.800> unique<00:05:59.550> shapes

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
so we see that to get into unique shapes

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.480 
so we see that to get into unique shapes
like<00:06:00.150> this<00:06:00.300> we<00:06:00.510> can<00:06:00.660> do<00:06:00.840> pick<00:06:01.230> points<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.430> I'm

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
like this we can do pick points so I'm

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.970 
like this we can do pick points so I'm
going<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.670> grab<00:06:02.820> that<00:06:03.000> hatch<00:06:03.270> use<00:06:04.140> pick<00:06:04.440> points

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
going to grab that hatch use pick points

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.620 
going to grab that hatch use pick points
and<00:06:05.160> if<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.610> hover<00:06:05.820> over<00:06:05.970> you'll<00:06:06.360> see<00:06:06.510> that

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
and if you hover over you'll see that

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.110 
and if you hover over you'll see that
allows<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.110> to<00:06:07.200> go<00:06:07.350> into<00:06:07.560> different<00:06:08.520> unique

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
allows you to go into different unique

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540 
allows you to go into different unique
closed<00:06:09.510> areas<00:06:10.080> so<00:06:10.650> that<00:06:10.770> works<00:06:10.950> really<00:06:11.070> well

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
closed areas so that works really well

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.180 
closed areas so that works really well
for<00:06:11.610> doing<00:06:12.120> something<00:06:12.390> like<00:06:12.570> this<00:06:13.500> triangle

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
for doing something like this triangle

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.000 
for doing something like this triangle
right<00:06:14.340> here<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:15.060> I'll<00:06:15.150> change<00:06:15.480> that<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:16.010> 20

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
right here and I'll change that to 20

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.160 
right here and I'll change that to 20
again<00:06:17.450> and<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:20.310> could<00:06:20.490> also<00:06:20.670> do<00:06:21.060> this<00:06:21.480> exterior

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
again and I could also do this exterior

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.130 
again and I could also do this exterior
part<00:06:22.410> of<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.560> circle<00:06:22.950> to<00:06:23.100> match<00:06:23.900> so<00:06:24.900> if<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.080> do

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
part of the circle to match so if I do

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.010 
part of the circle to match so if I do
that<00:06:25.400> hit<00:06:26.400> enter<00:06:26.820> I'd<00:06:27.420> like<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.750> notice

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
that hit enter I'd like you to notice

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.160 
that hit enter I'd like you to notice
something<00:06:28.590> when<00:06:29.160> I<00:06:29.220> come<00:06:29.550> over<00:06:29.760> here<00:06:30.330> if<00:06:30.510> I

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
something when I come over here if I

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.260 
something when I come over here if I
click<00:06:31.230> on<00:06:31.680> that<00:06:31.710> initial<00:06:32.400> hatch<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:32.820> did<00:06:33.060> it's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
click on that initial hatch I did it's

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.080 
click on that initial hatch I did it's
it's<00:06:33.720> own<00:06:33.930> unique<00:06:34.340> object<00:06:35.340> I'll<00:06:35.820> hit<00:06:35.970> escape

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
it's own unique object I'll hit escape

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.260 
it's own unique object I'll hit escape
and<00:06:36.660> now<00:06:37.380> you'll<00:06:37.530> see<00:06:37.560> this<00:06:37.860> triangle<00:06:38.190> and<00:06:38.670> the

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
and now you'll see this triangle and the

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.020 
and now you'll see this triangle and the
circle<00:06:39.510> are<00:06:39.960> together<00:06:40.710> as<00:06:41.220> an<00:06:41.400> object<00:06:41.880> and

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
circle are together as an object and

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.310 
circle are together as an object and
that's<00:06:42.180> because<00:06:42.450> I<00:06:42.540> did<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:42.870> hatch<00:06:43.050> at<00:06:43.230> the

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
that's because I did the hatch at the

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.350 
that's because I did the hatch at the
same<00:06:43.560> time<00:06:43.860> so<00:06:44.400> it's<00:06:44.520> just<00:06:44.670> something<00:06:44.940> to<00:06:45.180> keep

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
same time so it's just something to keep

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.100 
same time so it's just something to keep
in<00:06:45.480> mind<00:06:46.190> okay<00:06:47.190> so<00:06:47.250> to<00:06:47.520> do<00:06:47.700> this<00:06:47.850> final<00:06:48.180> one<00:06:48.600> we

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
in mind okay so to do this final one we

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.950 
in mind okay so to do this final one we
have<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.830> hatch<00:06:50.040> going<00:06:50.490> all<00:06:50.640> the<00:06:51.150> way<00:06:51.180> across

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
have the hatch going all the way across

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.280 
have the hatch going all the way across
the<00:06:52.290> drawing<00:06:52.620> okay<00:06:53.580> so<00:06:53.640> the<00:06:54.360> previous<00:06:54.630> ones<00:06:55.050> I

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
the drawing okay so the previous ones I

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.750 
the drawing okay so the previous ones I
did<00:06:55.470> hatch<00:06:57.290> picked<00:06:58.290> my<00:06:59.060> pattern

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
did hatch picked my pattern

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.090 
did hatch picked my pattern
and<00:07:00.850> I<00:07:00.940> had<00:07:01.060> used<00:07:01.270> pick<00:07:01.600> points<00:07:02.170> right<00:07:02.440> well

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 
and I had used pick points right well

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.950 
and I had used pick points right well
you'll<00:07:03.310> notice<00:07:03.550> that<00:07:03.910> if<00:07:04.210> you<00:07:04.360> try<00:07:04.570> to<00:07:04.630> go<00:07:04.810> in

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
you'll notice that if you try to go in

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.890 
you'll notice that if you try to go in
and<00:07:05.200> do<00:07:05.380> that<00:07:05.410> it's<00:07:05.950> just<00:07:06.130> going<00:07:06.280> to<00:07:06.430> keep

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
and do that it's just going to keep

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.240 
and do that it's just going to keep
moving<00:07:07.900> your<00:07:08.200> hatch<00:07:08.440> around<00:07:08.830> and<00:07:08.980> it's<00:07:09.100> very

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
moving your hatch around and it's very

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.670 
moving your hatch around and it's very
frustrating<00:07:09.490> what<00:07:10.420> you<00:07:10.570> need<00:07:10.750> to<00:07:10.870> do<00:07:11.050> is<00:07:11.320> the

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
frustrating what you need to do is the

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.120 
frustrating what you need to do is the
select<00:07:12.430> and<00:07:12.850> that<00:07:13.840> will<00:07:14.020> allow<00:07:14.170> you<00:07:14.230> to<00:07:14.380> select

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
select and that will allow you to select

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.050 
select and that will allow you to select
any<00:07:16.170> given<00:07:17.170> shape<00:07:17.530> you<00:07:18.520> need<00:07:18.640> to<00:07:18.730> get<00:07:18.850> out<00:07:18.970> of

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
any given shape you need to get out of

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.360 
any given shape you need to get out of
there<00:07:19.150> for<00:07:19.330> a<00:07:19.390> second

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
there for a second

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.240 
there for a second
select<00:07:21.370> and<00:07:21.760> there<00:07:22.510> you<00:07:22.660> go<00:07:22.900> so<00:07:23.830> now<00:07:23.980> it<00:07:24.100> goes

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
select and there you go so now it goes

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.750 
select and there you go so now it goes
all<00:07:24.520> the<00:07:24.580> way<00:07:25.080> over<00:07:26.080> this<00:07:26.830> other<00:07:27.070> geometry<00:07:27.700> so

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
all the way over this other geometry so

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.820 
all the way over this other geometry so
I'll<00:07:27.940> hit<00:07:28.060> enter<00:07:28.450> and<00:07:28.630> now<00:07:29.320> you'll<00:07:29.500> see<00:07:29.560> that

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
I'll hit enter and now you'll see that

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.310 
I'll hit enter and now you'll see that
we<00:07:29.980> have<00:07:30.220> on<00:07:30.520> the<00:07:30.730> same<00:07:31.000> basic<00:07:31.630> drawing<00:07:31.900> that

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
we have on the same basic drawing that

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.950 
we have on the same basic drawing that
we<00:07:32.470> started<00:07:32.800> with
