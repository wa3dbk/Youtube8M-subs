we're<00:00:46.379> using<00:00:46.559> DPF<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.430> diesel<00:00:47.700> particulate

we're using DPF for diesel particulate
filter<00:00:48.530> where<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.770> run<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> exhaust<00:00:50.520> gas

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

through<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.510> filter<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> cleans<00:00:52.379> up

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
through that filter and that cleans up

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.560 
through that filter and that cleans up
the<00:00:52.590> air<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.399> when<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.670> need<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.210> we

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the air and then when we need to we we

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
the air and then when we need to we we
regenerate<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.559> an<00:00:55.649> automatic<00:00:56.160> system

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
regenerate it it's an automatic system

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
regenerate it it's an automatic system
so<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> operator<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.660> runs<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> Machine

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so the operator just runs the Machine

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
so the operator just runs the Machine
doesn't<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.399> doesn't

we need to all the time the operator can

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
we need to all the time the operator can
