in<00:00:23.880> our<00:00:24.000> example<00:00:25.130> we've<00:00:26.130> used<00:00:26.400> simply<00:00:26.820> just

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
in our example we've used simply just

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.689 
in our example we've used simply just
some<00:00:27.359> paving<00:00:27.779> stones<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.800> decay<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.340> would

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
some paving stones then decay that would

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.209 
some paving stones then decay that would
normally<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.269> depth<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.199> eight<00:00:31.710> inches<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
normally be the depth of eight inches of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
normally be the depth of eight inches of
a<00:00:32.340> gravel<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.969> constituting<00:00:33.899> re-grow

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a gravel just constituting re-grow

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
a gravel just constituting re-grow
unfortunately<00:00:35.160> we're<00:00:35.340> setting<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.270> top<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
unfortunately we're setting it on top of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.900 
unfortunately we're setting it on top of
paving<00:00:37.200> stones<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> idea<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> same

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
paving stones but the idea is the same

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
paving stones but the idea is the same
we're<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.260> putting<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> paving

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we're going to be putting the paving

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.729 
we're going to be putting the paving
stones<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.640> against<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> curb<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.350> hard

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
stones up against the curb or a hard

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.100 
stones up against the curb or a hard
feature<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.149> normally<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:45.960> be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
feature now normally this will be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.799 
feature now normally this will be
pocketed<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.829> gravel<00:00:47.309> again<00:00:47.940> six<00:00:48.360> inches<00:00:48.629> deep

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
pocketed a gravel again six inches deep

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.700 
pocketed a gravel again six inches deep
and<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.730> any<00:00:50.820> one-inch<00:00:51.480> pipe<00:00:52.230> laid

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and you would put any one-inch pipe laid

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.729 
and you would put any one-inch pipe laid
on<00:00:52.980> top<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.590> could

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
on top so that we can do is we could

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.420 
on top so that we can do is we could
pull<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.460> sand<00:00:56.730> across<00:00:57.230> evenly<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.190> gives

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pull the sand across evenly so it gives

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
pull the sand across evenly so it gives
us<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.850> smooth<00:01:00.149> surface<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.870> install<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
us a smooth surface to install the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.270 
us a smooth surface to install the
pavers<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.510> avoiding<00:01:03.510> any<00:01:03.750> deflections<00:01:04.619> bumps

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pavers on avoiding any deflections bumps

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
pavers on avoiding any deflections bumps
or<00:01:06.110> mounds<00:01:07.110> type<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.750> normally<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
or mounds type thing so normally you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
or mounds type thing so normally you
would<00:01:10.020> lay<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> pipes<00:01:10.729> anywhere<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:11.939> eight

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
would lay the pipes anywhere from eight

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
would lay the pipes anywhere from eight
to<00:01:12.210> ten<00:01:12.630> eight<00:01:12.780> ten<00:01:13.110> feet<00:01:13.350> apart<00:01:13.640> using<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> 2x4

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to ten eight ten feet apart using a 2x4

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.940 
to ten eight ten feet apart using a 2x4
or<00:01:15.420> 2x6<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:16.950> straightedge<00:01:17.700> piece<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.240> wood

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
or 2x6 or any straightedge piece of wood

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.910 
or 2x6 or any straightedge piece of wood
two<00:01:19.950> guys<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.580> pull<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.330> sand<00:01:21.600> across

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.830 

straight<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.770> would<00:01:27.890> normally<00:01:28.840> if

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
straight so you would normally if

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.180 
straight so you would normally if
there's<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> heavy<00:01:30.350> load<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.740> front<00:01:30.979> you're

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
there's a heavy load in front you're

00:01:31.190 --> 00:02:00.249 
there's a heavy load in front you're
just<00:01:31.340> going<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.550> pull<00:01:31.909> off<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.090> top<00:01:59.259> and

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
just going to pull off the top and

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.190 
just going to pull off the top and
continue<00:02:00.920> screen<00:02:01.640> pulling<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.450> fan<00:02:02.690> towards

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
continue screen pulling the fan towards

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.890 
continue screen pulling the fan towards
you<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.100> pull<00:02:04.490> up<00:02:04.729> edit<00:02:05.210> material<00:02:05.330> on<00:02:05.720> top

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.090 

sometimes<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.170> might<00:02:12.290> find<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.680> rock<00:02:12.920> or

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
sometimes you might find a rock or

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.890 
sometimes you might find a rock or
something<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.660> drag

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
something like that so you drag

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420 
something like that so you drag
something<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.650> always<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.040> throw<00:02:16.250> some

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
something you can always just throw some

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.650 
something you can always just throw some
sand<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.760> top<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:17.120> them<00:02:22.030> now<00:02:23.030> for<00:02:23.269> something

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

that's a longer area imagine that these

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.759 
that's a longer area imagine that these
rails<00:02:26.300> are<00:02:26.660> buddy<00:02:26.959> feet<00:02:27.260> apart

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
rails are buddy feet apart

rails are buddy feet apart
if<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.340> patio<00:02:28.670> was<00:02:28.850> 16<00:02:29.239> feet<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:30.620> would<00:02:30.739> put

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
if the patio was 16 feet you would put

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.300 
if the patio was 16 feet you would put
up<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.760> rail<00:02:32.440> again<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.769> gravel<00:02:34.190> would

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
up this rail again the a gravel would

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.220 
up this rail again the a gravel would
continue<00:02:34.760> across<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.329> patio<00:02:35.540> you've

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
continue across on the patio you've

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.860 
continue across on the patio you've
reset<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.799> round<00:02:37.040> top<00:02:37.489> of<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> gravel<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
reset the round top of the gravel and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.210 
reset the round top of the gravel and
then<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.200> could<00:02:39.880> pull<00:02:40.880> you're<00:02:41.030> shooting

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
then you could pull you're shooting

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.009 
then you could pull you're shooting
across<00:02:43.220> you'd<00:02:43.640> work<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.840> different

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
across you'd work in two different

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.500 
across you'd work in two different
sections<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.579> patio
