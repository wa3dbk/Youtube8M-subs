sequel just fill it with a bit more
authority<00:05:11.669> like<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:12.090> might<00:05:12.360> be<00:05:12.389> worth

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
authority like that might be worth

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.909 
authority like that might be worth
trying

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
trying

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.310 
trying
listen<00:05:14.639> I'm<00:05:14.760> no<00:05:14.909> expert<00:05:15.060> on<00:05:15.419> this<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.840> may<00:05:16.260> be

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
listen I'm no expert on this it may be

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.219 
listen I'm no expert on this it may be
worth<00:05:16.620> trying<00:05:16.830> maybe<00:05:17.070> if<00:05:17.430> your<00:05:18.150> heel<00:05:18.539> size<00:05:18.900> was

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
worth trying maybe if your heel size was

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.320 
worth trying maybe if your heel size was
a<00:05:19.500> little<00:05:19.979> bit<00:05:20.130> less<00:05:20.400> maybe<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.150> would<00:05:21.300> be

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
a little bit less maybe it would be

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.300 
a little bit less maybe it would be
picture<00:05:21.900> quite<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:22.380> far<00:05:22.560> forward<00:05:22.860> I'm<00:05:23.070> not

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
picture quite so far forward I'm not

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.279 
picture quite so far forward I'm not
saying<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:23.669> securable<00:05:24.300> but<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.139> pot

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
saying that securable but it's a pot

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:43.469 
saying that securable but it's a pot
it's<00:05:25.500> an<00:05:25.590> idea<00:05:26.010> yeah

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.279 

we're<00:05:44.479> getting<00:05:44.810> back<00:05:44.960> yes<00:05:45.860> we<00:05:46.159> are<00:05:46.460> bit<00:05:46.940> by<00:05:47.360> bit

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
we're getting back yes we are bit by bit

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.600 
we're getting back yes we are bit by bit
but<00:05:48.590> it's<00:05:48.710> safe<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:48.919> say<00:05:49.129> that<00:05:49.310> your

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
but it's safe to say that your

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.790 
but it's safe to say that your
background<00:05:49.849> in<00:05:50.330> dancing<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.080> very<00:05:51.139> different
