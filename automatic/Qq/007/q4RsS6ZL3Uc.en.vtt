00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
then square in a circle at the same time

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
then square in a circle at the same time
and<00:00:37.800> that'll<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> factory<00:00:38.610> reset<00:00:38.820> it's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
difference in the rate of fire and I'm

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.770 
difference in the rate of fire and I'm
gonna<00:02:35.519> show<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.879> now

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
see the lag the numbers are going up

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.959 
see the lag the numbers are going up
just<00:02:49.680> changing<00:02:51.469> very<00:02:52.469> different<00:02:53.249> very
