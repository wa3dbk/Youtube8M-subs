deep treatment by camaros naturals and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
deep treatment by camaros naturals and
then<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.539> olive<00:00:58.109> oil<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.590> top<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.250> which

then I put olive oil on top of it which

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.720 
then I put olive oil on top of it which
it<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.449> made<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> difference<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.730> my

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it really made a difference because my

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
it really made a difference because my
hair<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.120> been<00:01:03.239> dry<00:01:03.510> lately<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
hair have been dry lately and I think it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
hair have been dry lately and I think it
has<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> haven't<00:01:05.909> been<00:01:06.210> adding

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
has been because I haven't been adding

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740 
has been because I haven't been adding
oils<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.100> did<00:01:08.640> conditioned<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
oils to it so I did conditioned with the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280 
oils to it so I did conditioned with the
olive<00:01:10.049> oil<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:12.900> results

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.910 
just trade it in one big grain for I'm
going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.689> doing<00:02:30.870> two<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.530> want<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.799> each

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
going to be doing two don't want to each

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.100 
going to be doing two don't want to each
side

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.890 

and<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.370> when<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.490> get<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> an<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.420> always

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and then when I get to the an is always

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then when I get to the an is always
a<00:02:46.730> thinner<00:02:47.730> piece<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.420> hair<00:02:48.630> another<00:02:48.960> tour

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
a thinner piece of hair another tour

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.470 
a thinner piece of hair another tour
think<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.570> just<00:02:51.570> add<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:53.040> thin<00:02:53.280> piece<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
think so I just add the thin piece to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.450 
think so I just add the thin piece to
one<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> them<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.560> start<00:02:55.800> twisting<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
one of them and then start twisting the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:06.140 
one of them and then start twisting the
end<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> perfect<00:03:05.130> braid<00:03:05.670> but

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
end and it's not a perfect braid but

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.960 
end and it's not a perfect braid but
it's<00:03:06.870> good<00:03:07.200> enough<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.650> stretch<00:03:07.860> my<00:03:08.190> hair<00:03:08.400> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:18.640 
it's good enough to stretch my hair so
I'm<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.420> do<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> other<00:03:09.870> side<00:03:10.260> now

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650
