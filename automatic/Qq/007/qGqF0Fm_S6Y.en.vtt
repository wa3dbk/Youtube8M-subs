a USB which connects to the heads itself
I<00:02:10.289> believe<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.130> then<00:02:11.640> here's<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> cable<00:02:12.980> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I believe and then here's the cable to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
I believe and then here's the cable to
the<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.580> all<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> setting<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.360> is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the this is all the setting like this is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.150 
the this is all the setting like this is
where<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> volume<00:02:16.440> controls<00:02:16.770> are<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
where all the volume controls are and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
where all the volume controls are and
what<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.810> 16<00:02:19.470> foot

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
what not and then this is the 16 foot

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
what not and then this is the 16 foot
cable<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.280> goes<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.020> headset<00:02:22.020> itself

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
cable that goes to the headset itself

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.820 
cable that goes to the headset itself
and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:22.830> into<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> ps3<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.360> believe<00:02:24.830> so

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and then into the ps3 so I believe so

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.930 
and then into the ps3 so I believe so

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
complicated but it's actually quite easy

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.850

to<00:06:11.330> set<00:06:11.539> up<00:06:11.570> in<00:06:12.169> other<00:06:12.260> takes<00:06:12.500> a<00:06:12.560> few<00:06:12.680> minutes

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
to set up in other takes a few minutes

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.680

this<00:06:17.479> headset<00:06:17.960> now<00:06:18.200> I've<00:06:18.650> only<00:06:18.770> had<00:06:18.950> it<00:06:19.010> for<00:06:19.130> a

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
this headset now I've only had it for a

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.100 
this headset now I've only had it for a
day<00:06:19.430> so<00:06:19.460> I<00:06:19.789> can't<00:06:20.270> really<00:06:20.419> recommend<00:06:20.630> it<00:06:20.960> for

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
day so I can't really recommend it for

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.050 
day so I can't really recommend it for
being<00:06:21.320> durable<00:06:21.740> I<00:06:22.130> don't<00:06:22.520> know<00:06:22.580> how<00:06:22.700> long<00:06:22.880> it's

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
being durable I don't know how long it's

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.390 
being durable I don't know how long it's
going<00:06:23.180> to<00:06:23.270> last<00:06:23.330> and<00:06:23.870> I<00:06:24.680> can't<00:06:24.919> really<00:06:25.010> say<00:06:25.340> you

going to last and I can't really say you

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.969 
going to last and I can't really say you
know<00:06:25.669> how<00:06:25.849> powerful<00:06:26.510> or<00:06:26.690> strong<00:06:27.680> it<00:06:27.860> is

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
know how powerful or strong it is

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.740 
know how powerful or strong it is
because<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.370> really<00:06:28.849> haven't<00:06:29.120> had<00:06:29.330> much<00:06:29.510> time
