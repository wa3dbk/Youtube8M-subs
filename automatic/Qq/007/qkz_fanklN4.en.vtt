00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
basically with these two devices over

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.800 
basically with these two devices over
here<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.700> was<00:00:05.819> basically<00:00:06.029> checking<00:00:06.540> them

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
here and I was basically checking them

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.759 
here and I was basically checking them
out<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.770> comparison<00:00:09.559> checking<00:00:10.559> out<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
out in a comparison checking out the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.109 
do speed test here so usually what I do
is<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.839> use<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> put<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:17.850> to

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
so you clearly can see which one is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.780 
so you clearly can see which one is
faster<00:03:15.980> here<00:03:18.070> but<00:03:19.070> then<00:03:19.190> again<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.580> one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
faster here but then again this one

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.810 
faster here but then again this one
still<00:03:19.970> has<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.210> render<00:03:20.540> stuff<00:03:21.580> overall<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
still has the render stuff overall the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.490 
still has the render stuff overall the
Windows<00:03:23.120> Phone<00:03:23.240> device<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.780> already<00:03:24.350> finished

this<00:03:27.410> one's<00:03:27.650> always<00:03:27.950> loading<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:28.610> slow<00:03:29.290> it's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
this one's always loading so slow it's

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.600 
this one's always loading so slow it's
pretty<00:03:30.530> weird<00:03:30.710> because<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:31.610> still<00:03:31.820> slow<00:03:32.150> I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
pretty weird because it's still slow I

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.860 
pretty weird because it's still slow I
mean<00:03:34.610> that's<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.210> something<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:35.750> want

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
mean that's not something that you want

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.080 
mean that's not something that you want
on<00:03:36.080> your<00:03:36.200> device<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.860> don't<00:03:37.460> want<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:37.970> it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
on your device you don't want to have it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.690 
on your device you don't want to have it
slow<00:03:38.420> when<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.840> boot<00:03:39.050> up<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.620> but<00:03:40.550> then

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
slow when you boot up like that but then

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.640
