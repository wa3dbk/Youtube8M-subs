00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.990 

all<00:00:08.149> right<00:00:08.389> let's<00:00:08.960> talk<00:00:09.349> about<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:10.000> position

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
all right let's talk about the position

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.690 
all right let's talk about the position
constraint<00:00:11.510> this<00:00:11.690> time<00:00:11.950> for<00:00:12.950> that<00:00:13.040> what<00:00:13.549> we

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
constraint this time for that what we

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.120 
constraint this time for that what we
want<00:00:13.879> to<00:00:13.969> do<00:00:14.059> first<00:00:14.420> of<00:00:14.570> all<00:00:14.980> rotating<00:00:15.980> this

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
want to do first of all rotating this

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.089 
want to do first of all rotating this
pedal<00:00:16.939> should<00:00:17.090> follow<00:00:17.300> and<00:00:17.720> those<00:00:18.590> should

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
pedal should follow and those should

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.760 
pedal should follow and those should
stay<00:00:19.400> flat<00:00:19.790> the<00:00:20.090> little<00:00:20.410> rubber<00:00:21.410> pieces

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
stay flat the little rubber pieces

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.679 
stay flat the little rubber pieces
because<00:00:22.340> your<00:00:22.520> foot<00:00:22.669> is<00:00:22.910> supposed<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.419> be<00:00:23.570> on

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
because your foot is supposed to be on

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.460 
because your foot is supposed to be on
there<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:24.140> they<00:00:24.380> need<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.740> be<00:00:24.859> flat<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.930> what<00:00:27.349> we

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
there so they need to be flat so what we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.230 
there so they need to be flat so what we
need<00:00:27.680> first<00:00:28.039> of<00:00:28.189> all<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:28.760> need<00:00:28.939> to<00:00:29.060> start

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
need first of all is we need to start

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.450 
need first of all is we need to start
linking<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.140> let's<00:00:30.380> link<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.859> whole<00:00:31.039> system

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
linking so let's link the whole system

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.189 
linking so let's link the whole system
together<00:00:31.609> so<00:00:32.119> we<00:00:32.330> start<00:00:32.599> with<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.840> pedal

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
together so we start with the pedal

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.080 
together so we start with the pedal
codes<00:00:33.590> with<00:00:33.769> this<00:00:33.920> little<00:00:34.250> shaft<00:00:34.489> go<00:00:34.790> from<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
codes with this little shaft go from the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.090 
codes with this little shaft go from the
little<00:00:35.360> shaft<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.900> big<00:00:36.050> one<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.530> then<00:00:36.860> to

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
little shaft to the big one and then to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.490 
little shaft to the big one and then to
the<00:00:37.550> main<00:00:37.790> part<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.540> we<00:00:38.809> do<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> same<00:00:39.080> on<00:00:39.410> the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the main part and we do the same on the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:49.350 
the main part and we do the same on the
other<00:00:39.589> end<00:00:39.739> go<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.670> small<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.860> now<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:49.250> we

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
other end go to the small so now if we

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.080 
other end go to the small so now if we
rotate<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:50.539> one<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:52.340> can<00:00:52.489> see<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.910> whole

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
rotate this one you can see the whole

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.720 
rotate this one you can see the whole
system<00:00:53.570> works<00:00:53.989> apart<00:00:54.710> from<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.340> pedals

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
system works apart from the pedals

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.600 
system works apart from the pedals
itself<00:00:56.379> they<00:00:57.379> are<00:00:57.559> not<00:00:57.710> flat<00:00:58.100> where<00:00:58.460> they

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
itself they are not flat where they

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.510 
itself they are not flat where they
should<00:00:58.820> be<00:00:59.530> horizontally<00:01:00.530> aligned<00:01:01.070> they<00:01:01.370> are

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
should be horizontally aligned they are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.700 
should be horizontally aligned they are
following<00:01:01.850> exactly<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.870> rotation<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.500> this

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
following exactly the rotation of this

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.180 
following exactly the rotation of this
all<00:01:03.859> thing<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.360> what<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:05.930> need<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.619> we

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
all thing so what we need to do is we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.980 
all thing so what we need to do is we
need<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.580> position<00:01:08.210> constraint<00:01:08.600> for<00:01:08.810> these

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
need a position constraint for these

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.410 
need a position constraint for these
first<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.100> all<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.369> need<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.670> unlink<00:01:11.210> them

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
first of all we need to unlink them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.330 
first of all we need to unlink them
because<00:01:12.050> we're<00:01:12.619> not<00:01:12.740> going<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.009> use<00:01:13.160> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
because we're not going to use the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.180 
because we're not going to use the
linking<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.440> but<00:01:15.440> we're<00:01:15.740> going<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.039> use

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
linking for that but we're going to use

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.770 
linking for that but we're going to use
the<00:01:16.750> animation<00:01:17.890> constrain

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the animation constrain

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.570 
the animation constrain
position<00:01:21.440> constraint<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.280> one<00:01:22.400> we're

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
position constraint that's the one we're

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.570 
position constraint that's the one we're
gonna<00:01:22.700> use<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.330> let<00:01:24.260> me<00:01:24.410> select<00:01:24.800> this<00:01:25.010> one<00:01:25.070> so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
gonna use and let me select this one so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.720 
gonna use and let me select this one so
I<00:01:25.610> can<00:01:25.910> show<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.770> animation<00:01:27.770> constrain

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
I can show you animation constrain

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.000 
I can show you animation constrain
position<00:01:29.570> constraint<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.380> position

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
position constraint and position

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.820 
position constraint and position
constrain<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.000> little<00:01:32.330> red<00:01:32.540> thing

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
constrain it to this little red thing

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.700 
constrain it to this little red thing
you<00:01:33.830> go<00:01:34.330> what<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:35.540> see<00:01:35.660> happening<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.260> the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
you go what you can see happening is the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.330 
you go what you can see happening is the
constrain<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.520> applied<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.510> course<00:01:38.750> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
constrain is applied and of course the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.980 
constrain is applied and of course the
pivot<00:01:40.340> point<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.880> object<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> pivot

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
pivot point of this object and the pivot

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.630 
pivot point of this object and the pivot
point<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.470> this<00:01:42.590> object<00:01:42.830> are<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:43.400> fully

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
point of this object are now fully

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.090 
point of this object are now fully
aligned<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.570> why<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.750> made<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.560> jump

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
aligned so that's why it made this jump

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.850 
aligned so that's why it made this jump
but<00:01:46.780> inside<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.900> settings<00:01:48.230> which<00:01:48.410> are<00:01:48.590> these

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
but inside the settings which are these

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.160 
but inside the settings which are these
you<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.550> keep<00:01:49.790> initial<00:01:50.210> offset<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.960> press

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
you have a keep initial offset so press

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.980 
you have a keep initial offset so press
that<00:01:51.320> one<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.430> original<00:01:52.940> position<00:01:53.840> will

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
that one and the original position will

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.950 
that one and the original position will
be<00:01:54.140> preserved<00:01:54.730> so<00:01:55.730> let's<00:01:55.940> do<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.180> same<00:01:56.390> on<00:01:56.690> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
be preserved so let's do the same on the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.380 
be preserved so let's do the same on the
other<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.790> animation<00:01:58.790> constrain

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
other one so animation constrain

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.480 
other one so animation constrain
position<00:02:00.290> constraint<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.100> little<00:02:01.340> red

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
position constraint to the little red

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.670 
position constraint to the little red

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
rotate it you go rotate you will see

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.220 
rotate it you go rotate you will see
that<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> pedals<00:02:13.670> are<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:13.910> staying<00:02:14.180> flat<00:02:14.510> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
that the pedals are now staying flat so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.130 
that the pedals are now staying flat so
they<00:02:15.830> are<00:02:16.010> now<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.330> position<00:02:17.630> where<00:02:17.990> your

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
they are now in the position where your

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.580 
they are now in the position where your
foot<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.740> normally<00:02:19.460> kind<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.230> doing<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.380> work

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
foot is normally kind of doing the work

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.699 
foot is normally kind of doing the work
for<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.640> you're<00:02:22.940> writing<00:02:23.390> about<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
for you when you're writing about it so

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.400 
for you when you're writing about it so
that's<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.010> for<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.060> position<00:02:26.780> constraint

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's it for the position constraint

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.900 
that's it for the position constraint
there<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:27.770> not<00:02:27.920> many<00:02:28.040> settings<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.610> can<00:02:28.730> have

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
there are not many settings you can have

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.550 
there are not many settings you can have
multiple<00:02:29.090> targets<00:02:29.720> we're<00:02:29.870> now<00:02:29.989> using<00:02:30.410> just

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
multiple targets we're now using just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.229 
multiple targets we're now using just
one<00:02:30.770> target<00:02:31.130> which<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.610> shaft<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
one target which is the shaft this

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.449 
one target which is the shaft this
little<00:02:32.570> red<00:02:32.690> thing<00:02:32.720> down<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> can

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
little red thing down here but you can

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.910 
little red thing down here but you can
have<00:02:34.550> multiple<00:02:34.790> ones<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.450> define<00:02:36.140> how<00:02:36.709> it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
have multiple ones which define how it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.699 
have multiple ones which define how it
is<00:02:37.070> influenced<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.290> keeping

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
is influenced but and this one keeping

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.040 
is influenced but and this one keeping
this<00:02:39.830> offset<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.970> that's<00:02:41.150> basically<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.660> it's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
this offset so that's basically it it's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.940 
this offset so that's basically it it's
all<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:43.160> complicated<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.239> useful<00:02:44.480> again<00:02:44.950> if

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
all not complicated but useful again if

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:55.800 
all not complicated but useful again if
you<00:02:46.160> want<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.370> do<00:02:46.459> stuff<00:02:46.970> like<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.180> Cheers

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
