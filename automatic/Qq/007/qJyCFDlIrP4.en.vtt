00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
didn't make an awful lot of sense to me

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
didn't make an awful lot of sense to me
to<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:53.189> often<00:01:53.850> look<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.360> say<00:01:54.540> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

young business there Michael when he

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.690 
young business there Michael when he
gets<00:02:15.260> enough<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.890> young<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.460> hearts

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
think the onus is on the the club's here

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.180 
think the onus is on the the club's here
to<00:02:22.550> provide<00:02:22.880> more<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> players<00:02:24.410> here<00:02:24.770> we

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
to provide more for the players here we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.620 
to provide more for the players here we
have<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.340> same<00:02:25.520> situation<00:02:26.060> same<00:02:26.180> problem<00:02:26.540> in

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
have the same situation same problem in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.420 
have the same situation same problem in
the<00:02:26.690> north<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> Ireland<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.470> well<00:02:27.620> because

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the north of Ireland as well because

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
the north of Ireland as well because
essentially<00:02:28.850> when<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.630> looked<00:02:29.960> at<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> lot

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
essentially when I have looked at a lot

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.320 
essentially when I have looked at a lot
of<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.440> clubs<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.100> UK<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
of the clubs in the UK and I and the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.700 
of the clubs in the UK and I and the
players<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.750> essentially<00:02:33.170> almost<00:02:33.470> full-time

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
players are essentially almost full-time

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.520 
players are essentially almost full-time
from<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.220> age<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.340> 13<00:02:34.880> 14<00:02:35.390> years<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.840> age<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.350> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
from the age of 13 14 years of age so I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.380 
from the age of 13 14 years of age so I
think<00:02:36.950> when<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.190> lads<00:02:37.340> go<00:02:37.550> across<00:02:37.730> its<00:02:38.000> Xtina

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
think when the lads go across its Xtina

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.970 
think when the lads go across its Xtina
I<00:02:38.480> think<00:02:38.660> there<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.930> gap<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.860> they

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
I think there is a gap there that they

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.220 
I think there is a gap there that they
never<00:02:40.190> bridge<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.630> difficult<00:02:41.840> for

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
never bridge and then it's difficult for

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.560 
never bridge and then it's difficult for
them<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.560> think<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.700> think<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> days<00:02:44.330> of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
them I think that I think the days of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.000 
them I think that I think the days of
where<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.020> Premier<00:02:45.350> League<00:02:45.500> has<00:02:45.650> gone<00:02:45.860> as

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
where the Premier League has gone as

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.860 
where the Premier League has gone as
well<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.430> example<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.940> player<00:02:47.360> won't<00:02:47.570> come<00:02:47.780> out

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
well for example a player won't come out

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.360 
well for example a player won't come out
of<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.020> League<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.230> Ireland<00:02:48.440> or<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.220> Irish

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
of the League of Ireland or the Irish

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.160 
of the League of Ireland or the Irish
League<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.940> go<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.510> level<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.990> football

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
League and go to that level of football

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.900 
League and go to that level of football
they'll<00:02:51.830> have<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.160> play<00:02:52.280> their<00:02:52.520> way<00:02:52.550> through

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
they'll have to play their way through

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.610 
they'll have to play their way through
the<00:02:53.060> league's<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.080> higher<00:02:54.230> level

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the league's to get to higher level

the league's to get to higher level
someone<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.010> Shaun<00:02:55.190> Williams<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> good

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
someone like Shaun Williams is a good

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.250 
someone like Shaun Williams is a good
example<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.750> know<00:02:56.870> who's<00:02:57.080> gone

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
example of that you know who's gone

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
way to do it but I do think that they're

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.060 
way to do it but I do think that they're
more<00:03:05.900> honest<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.410> club's<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.770> have<00:03:06.950> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
more honest that the club's you have to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.110 
more honest that the club's you have to
do<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> younger<00:03:07.820> players

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
do more for the younger players

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.250 
do more for the younger players

attending League of Ireland games with

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.720 
attending League of Ireland games with
the<00:03:11.959> view<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.230> seeing<00:03:12.470> what's<00:03:12.860> out<00:03:13.010> there<00:03:13.070> but

the view to seeing what's out there but

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.120 
the view to seeing what's out there but

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
is a realistic option to get somebody

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.229 
is a realistic option to get somebody
from<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> league<00:03:16.459> into<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.790> squad<00:03:17.060> because

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239

the competition is intense there are

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.229 
the competition is intense there are
plenty<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.070> players<00:03:19.280> playing<00:03:19.910> at<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> high

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
plenty of players playing at a high

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.960 
plenty of players playing at a high
level<00:03:20.269> across<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.959> water<00:03:21.110> yeah<00:03:21.880> personally<00:03:22.880> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
level across the water yeah personally I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.670 
level across the water yeah personally I
think<00:03:23.180> at<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.390> moment<00:03:23.570> I'm<00:03:23.930> no<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:24.500> think

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
think at this moment I'm no I just think

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.860 
think at this moment I'm no I just think
that<00:03:24.769> yeah<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.400> think<00:03:25.640> it's<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.390> duty<00:03:26.600> of<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
that yeah I think it's the duty of the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.600 
that yeah I think it's the duty of the
national<00:03:27.230> team<00:03:27.410> coaches<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.280> managers<00:03:28.340> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
national team coaches and managers to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.060 
national team coaches and managers to
obviously<00:03:29.380> view<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.500> league<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.830> look<00:03:30.950> at

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
obviously view the league and look at

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.530 
obviously view the league and look at
the<00:03:31.130> league<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.489> try<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:31.970> promote<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.360> young

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the league and try and promote the young

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.240 
the league and try and promote the young
players<00:03:32.810> out<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.590> league<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.040> full

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
players out of the league and a full

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.680 
players out of the league and a full
time<00:03:34.459> environment<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.180> think<00:03:35.390> there's<00:03:35.540> too

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
time environment but I think there's too

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.360 
time environment but I think there's too
many<00:03:35.810> players<00:03:36.170> playing<00:03:36.470> full-time<00:03:36.920> football

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
many players playing full-time football

choose<00:03:41.660> from<00:03:42.019> before<00:03:42.680> he<00:03:42.920> would<00:03:43.040> consider<00:03:43.459> a

choose from before he would consider a
player's<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:44.150> think<00:03:44.510> playing<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> League

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989

player's I think playing in the League
of<00:03:45.080> Ireland<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.440> be<00:03:45.500> honest<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.160> suppose<00:03:46.400> 21

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
of Ireland to be honest and I suppose 21

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
thing the international management team

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.470 
thing the international management team
could<00:03:48.980> do<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.610> they<00:03:49.880> see<00:03:49.940> somebody<00:03:50.299> with

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
could do is if they see somebody with

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.420 
could do is if they see somebody with
the<00:03:50.600> potential<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.650> league<00:03:51.799> possibly

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the potential in the league possibly

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.880 
the potential in the league possibly
recommend<00:03:53.180> them<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.690> I'm<00:03:54.290> trying<00:03:54.680> getting

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
recommend them and I'm trying getting

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.500 
recommend them and I'm trying getting
further<00:03:55.070> expell<00:03:55.640> will<00:03:55.790> happen<00:03:56.090> Peter<00:03:56.269> yeah<00:03:56.480> I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
further expell will happen Peter yeah I

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150 
further expell will happen Peter yeah I
think<00:03:56.690> where<00:03:56.989> they<00:03:57.080> see<00:03:57.140> players<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:58.040> have

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
think where they see players that have

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.490 
think where they see players that have
the<00:03:58.220> potential<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.790> move<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.690> watch<00:04:00.200> them

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the potential to move on that watch them

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.780 
the potential to move on that watch them
frequently<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.250> will<00:04:01.340> attract<00:04:01.640> other

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
frequently and that will attract other

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.250 
frequently and that will attract other
managers<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.450> other<00:04:02.570> Scouts<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.989> have<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.140> look

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
managers and other Scouts to have a look

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.780 
managers and other Scouts to have a look
at<00:04:03.380> those<00:04:03.470> same<00:04:03.680> players<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.549> would<00:04:04.700> agree

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
at those same players but I would agree

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.460 
at those same players but I would agree
with<00:04:05.269> Michael<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.750> think<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.170> number<00:04:06.380> of

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
with Michael I think the number of

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.140 
with Michael I think the number of
players<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.070> championship<00:04:07.700> alone<00:04:07.940> that

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
players in the championship alone that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.030 
players in the championship alone that
are<00:04:08.180> Irish<00:04:08.540> base<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:09.049> Republic<00:04:09.560> base<00:04:09.709> players

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
are Irish base for Republic base players

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.979 
are Irish base for Republic base players
at<00:04:10.220> around<00:04:10.370> 40<00:04:10.760> odd<00:04:10.880> players<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.720> know<00:04:11.810> that's

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
at around 40 odd players you know that's

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.539 
at around 40 odd players you know that's
a<00:04:12.080> phenomenal<00:04:12.440> amount<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.830> talent<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.220> look<00:04:13.400> at

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
a phenomenal amount of talent to look at

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.979 
a phenomenal amount of talent to look at
and<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:14.000> think<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.269> our<00:04:14.480> players<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:14.900> this

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
and to think that our players in this

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.960 
and to think that our players in this
league<00:04:15.049> will<00:04:15.950> be<00:04:15.980> good<00:04:16.190> enough<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.459> compete<00:04:16.850> at

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
league will be good enough to compete at

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.729 
league will be good enough to compete at
that<00:04:17.000> level<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.479> think<00:04:17.660> there's<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.140> there<00:04:18.650> is

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
that level I think there's a it there is

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.680 
that level I think there's a it there is
a<00:04:18.769> big<00:04:19.040> gap<00:04:19.310> between<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.760> two<00:04:20.000> standards<00:04:20.479> for

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
a big gap between the two standards for

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.420 
a big gap between the two standards for
that<00:04:20.720> amount<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.200> players<00:04:21.380> now<00:04:22.099> we<00:04:22.160> talked

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
that amount of players now we talked

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.700 
that amount of players now we talked
about<00:04:22.550> John<00:04:22.849> Daly<00:04:23.150> last<00:04:23.330> week<00:04:23.599> you<00:04:24.440> look<00:04:24.590> at

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
about John Daly last week you look at

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.500 
about John Daly last week you look at
players<00:04:24.919> like<00:04:25.160> him<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.430> are<00:04:25.520> performing<00:04:25.940> at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
players like him that are performing at

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.120 
players like him that are performing at
that's<00:04:26.810> what<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.590> equivalent<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
that's what the equivalent of the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.620 
that's what the equivalent of the
Scottish<00:04:28.400> tour<00:04:28.610> division<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.420> think

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
Scottish tour division so I think

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.660 
Scottish tour division so I think
there's<00:04:30.050> there's<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.410> huge<00:04:30.650> gap<00:04:30.920> between<00:04:30.950> the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
there's there's a huge gap between the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670 
there's there's a huge gap between the
standard<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.510> our<00:04:32.540> players<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:33.140> here<00:04:33.410> and

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
standard that our players have here and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.830 
standard that our players have here and
that<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.340> upper<00:04:34.850> echelons<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.510> divisions

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
that the upper echelons of the divisions

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.960 
that the upper echelons of the divisions
in<00:04:35.930> England<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.320> in<00:04:36.380> Scotland<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.860> think<00:04:37.850> those

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
in England and in Scotland I think those

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.670 
in England and in Scotland I think those
kind<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.330> conversations<00:04:39.020> happen<00:04:39.530> all<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
kind of conversations happen all the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.590 
kind of conversations happen all the
time<00:04:39.830> like<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.220> said<00:04:40.370> will<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.150> management

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
time like you said will the management

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.500 
time like you said will the management
team<00:04:41.780> be<00:04:42.010> recommending<00:04:43.010> players<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:44.210> English

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
team be recommending players to English

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.240 
team be recommending players to English
clubs<00:04:44.750> they<00:04:45.230> happen<00:04:45.530> all<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.650> time<00:04:45.800> like<00:04:46.100> any

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
clubs they happen all the time like any

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.800 
clubs they happen all the time like any
time<00:04:46.550> I'm<00:04:46.700> speaking<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.060> maid<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.540> mind<00:04:47.720> her

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
time I'm speaking the maid to mind her

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.210 
time I'm speaking the maid to mind her
manager<00:04:48.140> in<00:04:48.200> English<00:04:48.440> clubs<00:04:48.710> are<00:04:48.890> playing

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
manager in English clubs are playing

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.460 
manager in English clubs are playing
over<00:04:49.520> there<00:04:49.670> or<00:04:49.880> no<00:04:50.240> coaching<00:04:50.540> staffs<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
over there or no coaching staffs the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.130 
over there or no coaching staffs the
question<00:04:51.860> always<00:04:52.040> comes<00:04:52.220> up<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:53.450> if<00:04:53.600> anyone

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
question always comes up is if anyone

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.510 
question always comes up is if anyone
out<00:04:54.290> there<00:04:54.500> worth<00:04:54.650> taking<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.070> look<00:04:55.190> at

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
out there worth taking a look at

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.890 
out there worth taking a look at
so<00:04:55.730> those<00:04:55.880> things<00:04:56.150> always<00:04:56.360> happen<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:56.840> don't

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
so those things always happen I don't

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.810 
so those things always happen I don't
think<00:04:57.140> it's<00:04:57.260> their<00:04:57.380> job<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.980> be<00:04:58.370> getting

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
think it's their job to be getting

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.370 
think it's their job to be getting
better<00:04:59.030> clubs<00:04:59.360> for<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.660> players<00:04:59.900> here<00:05:00.170> that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
better clubs for the players here that

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.450 
better clubs for the players here that
ultimately<00:05:00.770> down<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.310> players

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
ultimately down to the players

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.950 
ultimately down to the players
themselves<00:05:01.700> but<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> think<00:05:02.780> there's<00:05:02.900> a

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
themselves but I think there's a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.360 
themselves but I think there's a
tendency<00:05:03.320> as<00:05:03.530> well<00:05:03.710> if<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.950> only<00:05:04.100> watch<00:05:04.340> one

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
tendency as well if you only watch one

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.880 
tendency as well if you only watch one
league<00:05:04.790> Disick<00:05:05.360> for<00:05:05.810> example<00:05:06.230> and<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:06.740> look

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
league Disick for example and you look

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.290 
league Disick for example and you look
at<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.070> best<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:07.550> when<00:05:07.670> he<00:05:07.790> should<00:05:08.030> be<00:05:08.150> in

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
at the best and so when he should be in

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.420 
at the best and so when he should be in
it<00:05:08.420> like<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:09.020> lads<00:05:09.200> have<00:05:09.350> said<00:05:09.560> there's<00:05:10.280> very

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
it like the lads have said there's very

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.160 
it like the lads have said there's very
good<00:05:10.520> players<00:05:10.880> not<00:05:11.420> in<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.660> squad<00:05:11.900> who<00:05:12.080> are

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
good players not in the squad who are

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.420 
good players not in the squad who are
playing<00:05:12.410> at<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.530> much<00:05:12.680> higher<00:05:12.710> level<00:05:13.040> in<00:05:13.280> this

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
playing at a much higher level in this

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:26.810 
playing at a much higher level in this
division

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.880
