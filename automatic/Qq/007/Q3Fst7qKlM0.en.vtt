 a fabric was stretched the frame 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 should have a thickness of at least 18 mm 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.619
 have on average move the

 Strengthen the keel frame from 18 mm up to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 45 mm the fabric consists of one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 shaved cotton or linen tissue 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.939

 small no need and inserts i 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.440
 do not use the ones only if after the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.869
 Dryer the pictures to voltage 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.380
 lose or because one end after one 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.820
 then it will take some time 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.470
 they should not be in the corners 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.830
