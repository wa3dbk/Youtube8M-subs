apart<00:00:43.200> thing<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:44.910> kind

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
apart thing going on I think it was kind

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
apart thing going on I think it was kind
of<00:00:45.210> meshed<00:00:45.480> together<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> tailoring

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
of meshed together in the tailoring

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
of meshed together in the tailoring
that's<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> those<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.930> worlds

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that's where it kind of those two worlds

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.040 
that's where it kind of those two worlds
collided<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:51.180> silhouettes<00:00:51.570> were<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.899> sort

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
collided the silhouettes were just sort

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.189 
collided the silhouettes were just sort
of<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.289> big<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.699> cropped<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of like big or cropped you know one of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
of like big or cropped you know one of
the<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> seemed<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.340> scattered

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the other and it seemed a bit scattered

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
the other and it seemed a bit scattered
and<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> travels<00:00:57.360> between<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:57.870> sort

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and it travels between the really sort

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
and it travels between the really sort
of<00:00:58.140> constrained<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> also<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.309> sort<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
of constrained and also very sort of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.990 
of constrained and also very sort of
fluid<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> elements<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
fluid so you have the elements which is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.230 
fluid so you have the elements which is
the<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.239> historical<00:01:03.750> ones<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.880> wild<00:01:05.880> when

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the more historical ones if wild when

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.520
