00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.000
 so halo journal comes to a new one 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.710
 Video 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 Thanks for turning on my name 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 human being the german council for everything around 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.850
 Battlefield 3 and 4 videos and today 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.490
 I'll tell you all about the fight 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 air in battlefield as explain there 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.490
 this video with many 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.890
 I want information packed 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.199
 maybe a few separate videos 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 to the topics mentioned make the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.579
 Air combat in the battlefield much exists 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.040
 Out of stealth effect will scout without 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
 telekom then come even more 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 whole and maybe the juwi 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.430
 they are also enthroned in the air 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.379
 By the way, for all who fly themselves 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.899
 wonder if the weather really the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.940
 Flow properties will change as soon as possible 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 it has been confirmed to me now 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 really that's what it means then 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 is stormy and whatever here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 nobody in the background hold 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 then your plane or helicopter 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 maybe also a little bit idiosyncratic 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's start with the jets 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 on this although I have unfortunately no 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 have allowed to record gameplay but have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 at least the stealth jet itself play 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.720
 What I noticed directly is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.479
 that the minigun has some more scatter 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.100
 that also means that you are opposing 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.299
 Infantry on the ground no longer so 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.220
 easy to do 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.799
 as is the case in Battlefield 3 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.229
 was in all the jets you can now his 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.869
 weapons even the first change that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 that you too in the normal stealth 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 jet with the normal smaller can without 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.200
 a larger 25 mm cannon can equip 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.880
 the even larger 30 millimeter cannon 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 Can only be in conjunction with the effect 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 which jets are used again 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.299
 a corner more harm against enemy 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240
 armor can serve as a second weapon 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.740
 can you then between hitzacker 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.950
 jerky so potts probably rockets 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.470
 guided by means of guided homing by means of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.869
 maverick means and active raider 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.270
 by deciding whether to do this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.149
 really with every jet so the self and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.610
 the label can be selected or 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.550
 if that is something else different 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.319
 Unfortunately, you do not know it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.670
 but would not be wrong if 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.670
 certain types of rocket only for one 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.730
 certain art available would be a 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.630
 detailed explanation to the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.970
 customization options and what these 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.760
 I will cause the next one to happen 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.220
 As defensive measures you have the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.160
 well-known flairs the easy in the room 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 and the fire extinguisher as you would with 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.230
 other vehicles in battlefield 3 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 you will also know the jet paintings 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.610
 or camps get to handle the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.560
 I even noticed that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.750
 these now a little faster 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.970
 but can maneuver in a direct 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 fight with another pilot 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.660
 Of course, that is still the case 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.750
 just as hard or easy to read 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.760
 Battlefield 3 is coming like that and now 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 we to the helicopters as well as already 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.799
 The jets seemed to me here as 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.410
 the recorders would be a bit maneuverable 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.110
 In the background you can see gameplay of me 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.799
 which was won with the zlv so 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.450
 a scout or screw in this art 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.819
 You can pretty much do helicopters 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.760
 change and adapt starting at 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.549
 The upgrades have regions of rage 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.609
 proximity and eray it is also direct 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.040
 already on the optics visum 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:28.810
 infrared and even an enhanced night 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 Vision goggles can be the first weapon for a short time 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.450
 either the normal 7 62 millimeters 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.090
 select cannon which is very good against 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.160
 infantry is or the larger 25th 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.440
 millimeter cannon take which ones 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 very well went slightly armored 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.280
 Vehicles suitable as a second weapon can 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.680
 you then still between heated and 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.570
 The laser guided means decide there 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.940
 but pretty much so 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.549
 Vehicle drivers are also on the way 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.160
 I would always stay with the ic yarn 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.829
 you too as a helicopter pilot could 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.720
 Of course, select defensive measures for 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.329
 disposal are the well-known 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.540
 infrared flyers of fire extinguishers or 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.639
 the icm glamor of the upgrades is there 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.910
 pretty interesting news because 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.709
 the stable quiet or stabilizer 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.150
 simply in German which helps you 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.609
 keep the helicopter in the air 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.190
 he should be badly damaged 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.170
 Furthermore, there is still an environment 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.050
 scansafe floating and eray 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.350
 the culprit has upgrades in the points 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.990
 ghana optics or normal optics secondary 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.330
 weapon and counter measure the same 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.550
 Options were options which is why I use these 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.230
 not just new again raise 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.030
 that would otherwise be a bit too 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.590
 need a lot of time for this video and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.220
 As I said I will anyway 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.900
 something closer to every single upgrade 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.060
 or attachments and such 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.550
 continue in a separate video 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.860
 new for that are the primary weapons 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.870
 hydra and johnny rockets for the pilot 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.910
 as it already on the e3 demo 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.860
 was shown as already with the 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.050
 other vehicles are also available here 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.170
 vehicle came or paint for the budget 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
 copter in the whole field in 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.590
 Battlefield 4 that they die 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.900
 aircraft compared to battlefield 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.910
 3 maneuver faster 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.680
 so maybe a little easier 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.960
 but I'm just curious how 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.060
 here the learning curve can be because it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.500
 would be bad if that is already the case 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.390
 maximum is I am sure that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 one of these now again a whole 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.450
 can get out 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.120
 but what I want to say it would be 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.460
 good pilot of a jet or helicopter 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.080
 was or will be in battlefield 4 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.000
 get along quickly 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.740
 well that was it as we already did 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.420
 again for this video i hope so 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.280
 that you liked it and if that 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.960
 As the case was, I would be very happy 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.430
 a thumbs upwards and if 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.650
 her the latest from the latest 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.570
 Battlefield 4 and more in the videos 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.550
 subscribe as you want to see here 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.750
 do not hurt thanks for seeing and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.750
 hopefully until next time
