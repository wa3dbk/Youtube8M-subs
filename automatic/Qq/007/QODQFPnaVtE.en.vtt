put the valve or the whole valve hold be

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.099 
put the valve or the whole valve hold be
check<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> tire<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:24.869> sure<00:00:24.960> there's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

can patch your tire you carry another

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.659 
can patch your tire you carry another
tube<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.060> replace<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> new<00:00:30.689> tube

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
tube you can replace it with a new tube

the<00:00:45.500> wording<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.039> tire<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
the wording on the tire up with the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
the wording on the tire up with the
valve<00:00:49.739> hole<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.840> preference

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
valve hole it's more just a preference

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.430 
valve hole it's more just a preference
thing<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> bead<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.750> continue

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
thing so I have the bead on continue

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
thing so I have the bead on continue
with<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.890> thumbs<00:00:56.280> working<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> around<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
with your thumbs working it around the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.610 
with your thumbs working it around the
rim<00:00:58.460> until<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> bead<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.030> totally<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.629> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
rim until the bead is totally on it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
rim until the bead is totally on it's
going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> pretty<00:01:02.100> tight<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:03.449> cases<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going to be pretty tight some cases you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.280 
going to be pretty tight some cases you
may<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> use<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> tire<00:01:04.650> lever<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
may have to use the tire lever for that

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.750 
may have to use the tire lever for that
so<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> new<00:01:10.049> tube

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
that's not on the rim over that portion

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.620 
that's not on the rim over that portion
ok<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.360> hands

ok and then starting from the valve
I'm<00:01:46.970> going<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.150> make<00:01:47.360> sure<00:01:47.600> not<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:47.930> pinch<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
I'm going to make sure not to pinch the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm going to make sure not to pinch the
tube<00:01:49.180> start<00:01:50.180> feeding<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.659> beat<00:01:50.930> in<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:53.119> we

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
tube start feeding this beat in so we

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.910 
tube start feeding this beat in so we
got<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.450> at<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.600> valve<00:01:53.869> keep<00:01:54.500> working<00:01:54.830> your

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
got it at the valve keep working your

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.700 
got it at the valve keep working your
way<00:01:55.070> around<00:01:55.180> see<00:01:56.180> I'm<00:01:56.300> feeding<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.110> tube<00:01:57.440> in

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
way around see I'm feeding the tube in

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.430 
way around see I'm feeding the tube in
there<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.340> not<00:01:58.490> pinched<00:01:59.170> if<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.290> do

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
there so it's not pinched if you do

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.810 
there so it's not pinched if you do
pinch<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.130> there<00:02:02.409> potentially<00:02:03.610> put<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> hole

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
pinch it in there potentially put a hole

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.389 
pinch it in there potentially put a hole
in<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.890> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:07.009> doing<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.369> over

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
in it going to be doing it all over

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.729 
in it going to be doing it all over
again<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:09.319> keep<00:02:10.069> feeding<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.550> in
