00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
dragon scale general i wasn't sure what

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.000 
dragon scale general i wasn't sure what
to<00:06:36.150> expect<00:06:36.240> from<00:06:36.660> that<00:06:36.840> as<00:06:37.020> a<00:06:37.050> four-man<00:06:37.500> of<00:06:37.620> 23

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
to expect from that as a four-man of 23

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.250 
to expect from that as a four-man of 23
it's<00:06:38.670> not<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:38.970> best<00:06:39.120> it's<00:06:39.510> triggered<00:06:39.900> ability

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
it's not the best it's triggered ability

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.440 
it's not the best it's triggered ability
seems<00:06:40.470> really<00:06:40.890> strong<00:06:41.190> if<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.520> can<00:06:41.670> make<00:06:42.270> it

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
seems really strong if you can make it

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.540 
seems really strong if you can make it
happen<00:06:42.600> the<00:06:43.530> problem<00:06:43.860> is<00:06:43.950> you<00:06:43.980> do<00:06:44.220> have<00:06:44.370> to

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
happen the problem is you do have to

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.860 
happen the problem is you do have to
have<00:06:44.700> a<00:06:44.940> reasonable<00:06:45.450> number<00:06:45.480> of<00:06:45.690> creatures

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
have a reasonable number of creatures

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.230 
have a reasonable number of creatures
and<00:06:46.260> you<00:06:46.470> need<00:06:46.620> to<00:06:46.710> tap<00:06:46.920> them<00:06:47.160> so<00:06:47.730> if<00:06:48.090> you're

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
and you need to tap them so if you're

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.870 
and you need to tap them so if you're
attacking<00:06:48.750> it<00:06:49.200> works<00:06:49.410> really<00:06:49.560> well<00:06:49.760> but<00:06:50.760> it

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
attacking it works really well but it

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.980 
attacking it works really well but it
can<00:06:50.970> be<00:06:51.060> hard<00:06:51.240> to<00:06:51.300> attack<00:06:51.600> when<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:51.870> have

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
can be hard to attack when you have

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.360 
can be hard to attack when you have
creatures<00:06:52.320> that<00:06:52.500> are<00:06:52.560> small<00:06:52.860> to<00:06:52.980> begin<00:06:53.070> with

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
creatures that are small to begin with

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.970 
creatures that are small to begin with
and<00:06:54.030> it's<00:06:54.570> also<00:06:54.810> really<00:06:55.080> good<00:06:55.260> as<00:06:55.380> outlast<00:06:55.770> if

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
and it's also really good as outlast if

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.260 
and it's also really good as outlast if
you<00:06:56.100> can<00:06:56.220> get<00:06:56.340> him<00:06:56.490> on<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.730> field<00:06:57.000> without
