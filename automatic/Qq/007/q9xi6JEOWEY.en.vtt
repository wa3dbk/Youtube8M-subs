chaining okay what is this oh ok two

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.249 
chaining okay what is this oh ok two
tokens<00:01:43.690> that's<00:01:44.690> fine<00:01:44.899> okay<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.950> saw<00:01:46.640> it

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
tokens that's fine okay so you saw it

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.389 
tokens that's fine okay so you saw it
hit<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:51.470> then<00:01:51.649> then<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.009> can<00:01:52.130> get<00:01:52.369> a

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
hit that and then then you can get a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.980 
hit that and then then you can get a
graph<00:01:52.670> up<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:52.970> if<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.119> can<00:01:53.210> discard<00:01:53.630> snow
