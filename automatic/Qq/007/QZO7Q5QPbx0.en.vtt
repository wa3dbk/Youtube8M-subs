00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
ownership away from any of us and makes

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.310 
ownership away from any of us and makes
it<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.160> fun<00:02:35.460> time<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.900> us<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> get

think that was the right approach to
take<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.970> been<00:02:42.180> cool<00:02:42.360> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
