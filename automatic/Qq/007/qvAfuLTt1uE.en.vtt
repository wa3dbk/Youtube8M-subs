when<00:01:53.820> things<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.450> flow<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
when things are in flow you know it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
when things are in flow you know it
because<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> feels<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.810> feels<00:01:58.110> like

because it feels so good it feels like

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
because it feels so good it feels like
things<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.189> resounding<00:01:59.610> yes<00:01:59.909> within

things are just a resounding yes within

things are just a resounding yes within
you<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:02.310> feels<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> right

you and it feels like it's the right
time<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.320> people<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
time it's the right people it's the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
time it's the right people it's the
right<00:02:05.250> idea<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.149> flow<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
right idea it's the right flow and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
right idea it's the right flow and
things<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.799> start<00:02:08.310> moving

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
things just start moving

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
things just start moving
propelling<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.840> forward<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.649> you're<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
propelling you forward because you're in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.910 
propelling you forward because you're in
your<00:02:11.340> own<00:02:11.519> current<00:02:12.239> you're<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.379> current

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
your own current you're in that current

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
your own current you're in that current
that<00:02:14.099> knows<00:02:14.400> where<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that knows where it's going so I like to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
that knows where it's going so I like to
think<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.650> current<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.670> flow<00:02:18.000> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
think of this as current this flow is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180 
think of this as current this flow is
our<00:02:18.420> inner<00:02:18.569> guidance<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.349> knows<00:02:19.620> where<00:02:20.040> we

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
our inner guidance that knows where we

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.449 
our inner guidance that knows where we
want<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.519> go<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.209> knows<00:02:21.739> what<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.920> need<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
want to go that knows what we need and

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.520 
want to go that knows what we need and
what's<00:02:23.610> best<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.060> us<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.540> every<00:02:24.720> situation

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
what's best for us in every situation

what's best for us in every situation
and<00:02:25.769> when<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:26.879> what<00:02:27.120> our<00:02:27.239> mind<00:02:27.569> thinks

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and when we go with what our mind thinks

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.339 
and when we go with what our mind thinks
our<00:02:28.290> attachments<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.970> past<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.959> this

whatever it may be then we're struggling

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.880 
whatever it may be then we're struggling
we're<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.540> against<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.290> natural

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

of<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.120> idea<00:04:50.419> came<00:04:50.780> through<00:04:51.169> that<00:04:51.500> felt<00:04:52.400> so

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
of the idea came through that felt so

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.720 
of the idea came through that felt so
good<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.419> both<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.750> us<00:04:53.870> right<00:04:54.290> away<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:55.070> was<00:04:55.430> a

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
good to both of us right away that was a

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.220 
good to both of us right away that was a
full<00:04:56.090> resounding<00:04:56.480> yes

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
full resounding yes

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.890 
full resounding yes
that<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.220> much<00:04:58.400> more<00:04:58.700> satisfying<00:04:59.150> and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
that is so much more satisfying and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.950 
that is so much more satisfying and
exciting<00:05:00.530> than<00:05:01.250> any<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.360> ideas<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.750> we

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
exciting than any of the ideas that we

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.830 
exciting than any of the ideas that we
had<00:05:03.110> before<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.820> it<00:05:05.000> really<00:05:05.270> was<00:05:05.450> so

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
had before and so it really was so

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.770 
had before and so it really was so
powerful<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.710> witness<00:05:07.100> how<00:05:07.370> our<00:05:07.730> our<00:05:08.300> inner

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
powerful to witness how our our inner

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.170 
powerful to witness how our our inner
guidance<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:10.070> inner<00:05:10.280> flow<00:05:10.760> knew

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
guidance that that inner flow knew

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.150 
guidance that that inner flow knew
something<00:05:11.720> wasn't<00:05:11.900> working<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.530> because<00:05:12.950> we

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
something wasn't working and because we

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.370 
something wasn't working and because we
were<00:05:13.280> able<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.700> let<00:05:13.880> go<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.510> just<00:05:15.110> hold

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
were able to let go of it and just hold

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.320 
were able to let go of it and just hold
space<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.310> just<00:05:16.550> take<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.760> break<00:05:17.090> and

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
space and and just take a break and

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.409 
space and and just take a break and
allow<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.260> come<00:05:18.530> through<00:05:18.919> then<00:05:19.760> we<00:05:20.300> were

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
allow it to come through then we were

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.230 
allow it to come through then we were
able<00:05:20.750> to<00:05:20.780> tap<00:05:21.440> into<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.250> connect<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.820> idea

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
able to tap into and connect to the idea

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.060 
able to tap into and connect to the idea
that<00:05:23.330> we<00:05:23.570> were<00:05:23.690> meant<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.050> follow<00:05:24.770> through

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
that we were meant to follow through

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.310 
that we were meant to follow through
with<00:05:25.250> in<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.460> first<00:05:25.610> place

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
with in the first place

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.719 
with in the first place
so<00:05:27.320> if<00:05:27.470> we<00:05:27.590> try<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.919> pull<00:05:28.190> those<00:05:28.370> our<00:05:28.580> way

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
so if we try to pull those our way

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.670 
so if we try to pull those our way
through<00:05:29.000> things<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.720> just<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.169> accomplish

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
through things and just to accomplish

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.440 
through things and just to accomplish
something<00:05:30.919> or<00:05:31.250> get<00:05:31.430> something<00:05:31.820> done<00:05:32.000> or<00:05:32.300> this

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
something or get something done or this

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.030 
something or get something done or this
thing<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:33.200> we<00:05:33.290> think<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.650> we<00:05:33.740> should<00:05:33.919> be

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
thing that we think that we should be

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.010 
thing that we think that we should be
doing<00:05:34.220> or<00:05:34.729> we<00:05:35.060> need<00:05:35.180> to<00:05:35.240> be<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.600> person<00:05:35.990> that

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
doing or we need to be this person that

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.140 
doing or we need to be this person that
we<00:05:36.200> think<00:05:36.320> that<00:05:36.470> we<00:05:36.530> should<00:05:36.800> be<00:05:36.950> when<00:05:37.669> we<00:05:37.820> when

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
we think that we should be when we when

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.810 
we think that we should be when we when
we<00:05:38.180> do<00:05:38.570> that<00:05:38.810> we're<00:05:39.110> not<00:05:39.410> actually<00:05:39.890> on<00:05:40.520> the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
we do that we're not actually on the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.710 
we do that we're not actually on the
right<00:05:41.030> path<00:05:41.680> most<00:05:42.680> often<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.790> the<00:05:44.150> path<00:05:44.419> that

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
right path most often the the path that

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.500 
right path most often the the path that
were<00:05:44.840> meant<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.169> take<00:05:45.500> is<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.010> one<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> is<00:05:47.000> in

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
were meant to take is the one that is in

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.550 
were meant to take is the one that is in
flow<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.620> make<00:05:49.280> being<00:05:49.790> in<00:05:50.030> flow<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.750> priority

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
flow so make being in flow a priority

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.740 
flow so make being in flow a priority
and<00:05:51.800> you'll<00:05:52.310> be<00:05:52.460> amazed<00:05:52.850> at<00:05:53.360> what<00:05:53.600> you<00:05:53.720> can

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
and you'll be amazed at what you can

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.290 
and you'll be amazed at what you can
create<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.470> how<00:05:54.560> effortless<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.340> is<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:56.060> we're

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
create and how effortless it is so we're

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.600 
create and how effortless it is so we're
very<00:05:56.540> excited<00:05:56.690> about<00:05:57.169> this<00:05:57.410> new<00:05:57.470> idea<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.190> at

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
very excited about this new idea and at

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.180 
very excited about this new idea and at
the<00:05:58.729> same<00:05:58.940> time<00:05:59.300> it's<00:06:00.110> not<00:06:00.260> something<00:06:00.979> that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
the same time it's not something that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.120 
the same time it's not something that
we're<00:06:01.460> attached<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.390> because<00:06:02.960> you<00:06:03.800> know<00:06:03.950> it's

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
we're attached to because you know it's

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.520 
we're attached to because you know it's
so<00:06:04.340> important<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.030> allow<00:06:05.660> things<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.140> always

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
so important to allow things to always

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.680 
so important to allow things to always
be<00:06:06.710> flowing<00:06:06.979> always<00:06:07.460> be<00:06:07.640> moving<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.210> to

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
be flowing always be moving and to

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.170 
be flowing always be moving and to
really<00:06:08.960> tune<00:06:09.320> in<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:10.250> our<00:06:10.280> inner<00:06:10.520> guidance<00:06:10.970> as

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
really tune in to our inner guidance as

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.590 
really tune in to our inner guidance as
we<00:06:11.390> go<00:06:11.570> so<00:06:11.900> that<00:06:12.080> as<00:06:12.290> this<00:06:12.470> idea<00:06:12.830> starts<00:06:13.600> starts

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
we go so that as this idea starts starts

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.360 
we go so that as this idea starts starts
manifesting<00:06:14.810> if<00:06:15.590> something<00:06:15.979> doesn't<00:06:16.130> feel

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
manifesting if something doesn't feel

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.120 
manifesting if something doesn't feel
right<00:06:16.430> later<00:06:16.850> on<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.900> know<00:06:17.990> it's<00:06:18.320> if<00:06:18.590> we're

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
right later on you know it's if we're

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.370 
right later on you know it's if we're
both<00:06:19.400> gonna<00:06:19.610> sit<00:06:19.910> down<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:20.450> reconnect<00:06:21.080> and
