wheat<00:00:13.290> harvest<00:00:13.770> and<00:00:17.390> I've<00:00:18.390> been<00:00:18.540> doing<00:00:18.779> for

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
wheat harvest and I've been doing for

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:56.630 
wheat harvest and I've been doing for
years<00:00:54.619> but<00:00:55.619> this<00:00:55.680> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.979> stuff<00:00:56.159> is<00:00:56.280> probably

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
years but this kind of stuff is probably

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.039 
years but this kind of stuff is probably
every<00:00:56.820> other<00:00:56.850> day<00:00:57.150> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> tasks<00:00:57.659> kind<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
every other day kind of tasks kind of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.570 
every other day kind of tasks kind of
just<00:00:58.199> depending<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.799> how<00:00:58.860> things<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.400> working

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
just depending on how things are working

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:25.450 
just depending on how things are working
out<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:07.140> actually<00:01:07.409> what<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> learned<00:01:07.860> on

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.400 

the<00:01:26.460> cast<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:26.970> smaller<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.930> hydraulic

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
the cast a lot smaller the hydraulic

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.840 
the cast a lot smaller the hydraulic
hoses<00:01:28.590> they're<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.010> individually<00:01:29.520> setup

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
hoses they're all individually setup

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.380 
hoses they're all individually setup
versus<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> sea<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:31.610> just<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:32.880> worn

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
versus the sea are just a lot more worn

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.640 
versus the sea are just a lot more worn
pretty<00:01:33.810> much<00:01:34.020> down<00:01:34.230> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> bare<00:01:34.620> necessities

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pretty much down to the bare necessities

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
pretty much down to the bare necessities
of<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.850> combine<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.930> here

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
of what you need for a combine over here

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.850 
of what you need for a combine over here
you<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.130> art<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.730> art<00:01:38.909> 9070<00:01:39.659> first<00:01:40.409> obvious

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you have art the art 9070 first obvious

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
you have art the art 9070 first obvious
thing<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.430> 36-foot<00:01:41.940> header<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
thing is we have a 36-foot header so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.740 
thing is we have a 36-foot header so
it's<00:01:43.920> also<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> pickup<00:01:44.640> reel<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.360> obviously

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's also a pickup reel so obviously

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
it's also a pickup reel so obviously
it's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.230> lot<00:01:46.320> different<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's a lot different like that and it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's a lot different like that and it's
also<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.400> Draper<00:01:47.730> header<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.890> bigger

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
also a Draper header you have bigger

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.420 
also a Draper header you have bigger
belt<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> big<00:01:50.610> versus<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> auger<00:01:51.330> header

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
belt kind of big versus the auger header

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.680 
belt kind of big versus the auger header
so<00:01:53.430> they're<00:01:53.550> thinking<00:01:53.760> about<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> crs<00:01:54.420> use

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
so they're thinking about the crs use

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.420 
so they're thinking about the crs use
they<00:01:54.870> have<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.050> lot<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.350> horsepower<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.280> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
they have a lot more horsepower they can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.370 
they have a lot more horsepower they can
handle<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.970> lot<00:01:57.390> thicker<00:01:57.570> wheat<00:01:57.870> they<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.260> do

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
handle a lot thicker wheat they can do

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
handle a lot thicker wheat they can do
go<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.800> lot<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:59.030> acreage<00:02:00.030> isn't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
go over a lot more acreage isn't

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:12.470 
go over a lot more acreage isn't
do<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:10.700> our<00:02:11.700> rule<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> thumb<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
do a lot more our rule of thumb is

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.670 
do a lot more our rule of thumb is
whenever<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> commlite<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:13.560> you're

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
whenever you get the commlite if you're

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
whenever you get the commlite if you're
gonna<00:02:13.769> start<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.489> remove<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.879> combine<00:02:15.269> or

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
gonna start it or remove the combine or

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.059 
gonna start it or remove the combine or
do<00:02:15.540> anything<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.019> we<00:02:16.379> always<00:02:16.500> honk<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
do anything like that we always honk the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.390 
do anything like that we always honk the
horn

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
horn

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
horn
and<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> walk<00:02:18.180> around<00:02:18.209> make<00:02:18.599> sure<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and do a walk around make sure that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
and do a walk around make sure that
nobody<00:02:19.140> nobody<00:02:19.739> knows<00:02:19.980> what's<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.430> or

nobody nobody knows what's going on or
earlier<00:02:21.209> when<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.390> were<00:02:21.510> greasing<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.989> chains

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
earlier when we were greasing the chains

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.229 
earlier when we were greasing the chains
I<00:02:22.500> talked<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.549> horn<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:23.879> Brandon<00:02:24.150> would

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
I talked the horn when Brandon would

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.520 
I talked the horn when Brandon would
tell<00:02:24.360> me<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> start<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.810> up<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.049> case<00:02:25.170> somebody

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
tell me to start it up in case somebody

happened<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.160> other<00:02:26.340> side<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.610> we

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
happened to be on the other side that we

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.039 
happened to be on the other side that we
could<00:02:27.030> see<00:02:27.239> out<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.599> mirrors<00:02:27.900> or

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
could see out of the mirrors or

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.020 
could see out of the mirrors or
something<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.879> lot

you know where everybody is these

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
you know where everybody is these
machines<00:02:33.840> varies<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.110> pretty
