00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
middle position but in the bridge we

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.289 
middle position but in the bridge we
have<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> phat<00:01:20.820> 50s<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.530> bit

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
figured that if we combined that tone
with<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> 69s<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.350> some
