00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
inside looks like all right I got the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.340 
inside looks like all right I got the
quarter<00:00:32.579> cut<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.089> here<00:00:33.269> I'm<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.839> little<00:00:34.170> bit

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
quarter cut out of here I'm a little bit

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.880 
quarter cut out of here I'm a little bit
of<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.559> rust<00:00:34.890> hole<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.370> inner<00:00:35.579> panel<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.890> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
of a rust hole that inner panel there so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.960 
of a rust hole that inner panel there so
I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> trim<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.199> see

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
I'm going to trim that out now and see

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.000 
I'm going to trim that out now and see
see<00:00:41.970> how<00:00:42.089> small<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.899> piece<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.589> put<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
see how small of a piece I can put it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.420 
see how small of a piece I can put it
there<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> fit<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.790> fix<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> trim

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there to fit it fix it so I have to trim

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
there to fit it fix it so I have to trim
out<00:00:47.550> any<00:00:47.729> more<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> quarter<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.739> really

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
out any more of the quarter it's really

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.200 
out any more of the quarter it's really
hoping<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.309> wouldn't<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.699> get<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hoping I wouldn't have to get into that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
hoping I wouldn't have to get into that
but<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> do

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but you know so so what you have to do

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
but you know so so what you have to do
do<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:55.309> well<00:00:56.989> more<00:00:57.989> rust<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.530> cut<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
do it right well more rust I cut out the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.619 
do it right well more rust I cut out the
more<00:00:59.399> rust<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> find<00:01:01.820> that's<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> last<00:01:03.269> layer

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
more rust I find that's the last layer

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.169 
more rust I find that's the last layer
so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.979> won't<00:01:08.190> be<00:01:08.340> any<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.610> outs<00:01:08.820> top<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
so I that won't be any more outs top of

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.940 
so I that won't be any more outs top of
that<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.630> least<00:01:09.929> I<00:01:10.170> mean<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.440> guess<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.800> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that at least I mean I guess that's a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
that at least I mean I guess that's a
good<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:12.090> gonna<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.660> get<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
good thing I'm gonna have to get that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
good thing I'm gonna have to get that
cut<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.220> patch<00:01:14.399> bill<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> then

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cut out and get a patch bill and then

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
cut out and get a patch bill and then
just<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.289> of<00:01:16.350> slowly<00:01:16.710> build<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.310> whole

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
just kind of slowly build the whole

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
just kind of slowly build the whole
thing<00:01:17.820> back<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.649> till<00:01:19.649> it's<00:01:19.860> good<00:01:20.039> again<00:01:21.619> I'll

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
thing back out till it's good again I'll

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
thing back out till it's good again I'll
start<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> video<00:01:23.130> again<00:01:23.310> once<00:01:23.789> I<00:01:23.940> got<00:01:24.149> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
start the video again once I got that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.679 
start the video again once I got that
patch<00:01:24.750> tacked<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.470> there

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
patch tacked in there

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.069 
patch tacked in there
and<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.200> start<00:01:28.469> building<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.570> from<00:01:30.570> there

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and just start building it from there

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.490 
and just start building it from there
all<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:32.360> all<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.539> got<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> first

all right all right I got the first

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.630 
all right all right I got the first
