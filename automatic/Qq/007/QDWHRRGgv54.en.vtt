 how will miguel be good then after 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.090
 a long time I come again doing 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.100
 tutorial videos 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.260
 and good the subject of today is the following 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.840
 well I found a post on taringa 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.390
 of this user that obviously all 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 challenges about converting to windows 8 of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 these fish and leave windows server good 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 Well, what we need is a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.490
 application that is called xiii city is a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 application that I have already used in this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.940
 channel to remove in windows ubuntu 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 and good I'll leave the lic 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 in the description they are installed and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 we'll start installing it and we'll 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.580
 execute as it says here is our 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.350
 impression and indivisible and when good 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.260
 is going to ask you what oil is something to go to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 make this good and you get this way 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.440
 Let's go to Edith Wood Hair 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 and here we are going to select windows 8 and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.809
 abuse the limit 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.809
 yes 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:14.120
 8 windows 7 10 6 we continue now we close 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.920
 Wow 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.920
 now we are going to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 for himself 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.330
 to a direct from the parent control panel 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330
 of control 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.150
 I will look for it and when I find it 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.580
 I will be back 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.320
 good about the simple way we're going to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.250
 look for programs to get partition of 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.250
 reformat partitions 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.360
 well here is where good if you believe 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.760
 a partition 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.240
 I create a partition that is new bold 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.530
 what is with the initial b 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.229
 let's go to my team local disk team 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.080
 this is windows 8 so we're going to 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.170
 remove 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.770
 let's give it here in the new bold 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.450
 let's eliminate boludo 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.850
 if they are assigned now we are going to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.990
 select egg then simple volume 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.580
 next next 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.360
 let's give it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.230
 it is best to extend it because at the moment 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.540
 today that your partition before a disk 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.660
 hard was reduced or is it beat him 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 size we are going to give in this case the disk 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.610
 hard that I cut was the one so I'd 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
 come on let's session the disk that you 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.410
 did you use the right click extend 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.130
 following 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.650
 until the next end the govern and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.660
 until now I'm going to restart the machine 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.330
 so that as well as I want demands 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.470
 alright so now let's paralyze the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 from the computer 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.630
 and now 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.230
 when it means that I'm recording 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.250
 with mystery when they join so if 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.390
 he moves a lot phone apologies 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.390
 but there starts 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:27.920
 and get windows 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.920
 I was very induced 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.570
 good because the system or 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.090
 you get the way to choose with what 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.780
 the system you want to start then that's 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.790
 because it's the module menu under the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.980
 window be just search the internet for 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.640
 You can remove it and it will start the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.710
 direct or if you do not go back to the xvii 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.600
 city if it is and vice well and at the moment of 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.810
 choose windows seven you take away the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.850
 popcorn where yes says and awaits 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.530
 and it's good because that's been all 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.720
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.470
 do not forget to subscribe and until the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.470
