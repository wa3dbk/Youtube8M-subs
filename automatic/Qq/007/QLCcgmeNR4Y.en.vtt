00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.690
 is going to be the surf world and we are 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.940
 liked with an instructor the instructor 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 robbie that such a good roy well 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.460

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.739

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 Well, he explained a bit about this 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 teach surfing as it is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.239
 efe 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.760
 frank layden h fish sweet and the wave 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 start and I go to the front clergy greenwheels 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.090
 perfect learning 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 technically of practices 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 warming is fundamental before 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 go surfing the perfect wave 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.100
 ah 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.240
 before trying with a real table 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 we practice in the sand a small 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 simulation of the basic steps of the sun 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.990
 the first step to take is to row towards 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 the ball distributing well the weight of your 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.080
 body on the board to avoid hitting 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.880
 when you have come close enough 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.860
 to be pushed only by the ball 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.470
 it was time to stand on the table 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.140
 You must learn to stop quickly with a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.700
 jump not getting on your knees first and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.830
 then stand up because you lose the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.259
 Balance completely when you get up 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.150
 distribute your weight on your legs 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.310
 which have to be bent and the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.739
 bust forward to keep the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.000
 balance may be that at the beginning no 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.770
 be very easy but as you 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.770
 practice will be very simple 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 ah 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.150
 now comes the most important maneuver and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.519
 more difficult the maneuver is called take 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.010
 off that means takeoff or start 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.420
 this is the base maneuver of surfing a 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.000
 once you feel that the wave is 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.640
 wearing stand upright in a jump and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.370
 keep your compact weight on the slope 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.250
 then slide to the bottom 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080
 of the wave and starts to spin slowly 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.069
 to continue taking the ball and that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.069
 this does not pass over you 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.489
 learning to surf requires a lot 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.680
 agility perseverance patience and about 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.200
 all you want these basic steps take 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.569
 perfecting it like all sports 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.569
 the sun needs time and practice
