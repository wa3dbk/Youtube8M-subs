00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
loss and didn't even know it so this is

loss and didn't even know it so this is
what<00:00:24.020> I<00:00:24.050> did<00:00:24.290> to<00:00:24.410> solve<00:00:24.680> my<00:00:24.860> problem<00:00:25.369> I<00:00:26.140> picked

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
what I did to solve my problem I picked

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.260 
what I did to solve my problem I picked
up<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:27.500> buffer<00:00:27.920> pedal<00:00:28.250> from<00:00:28.520> cement<00:00:28.970> mods

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
up this buffer pedal from cement mods

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.630 
up this buffer pedal from cement mods
and<00:00:29.780> I<00:00:29.990> placed<00:00:30.289> it<00:00:30.500> first<00:00:30.860> in<00:00:31.070> line<00:00:31.280> on<00:00:31.550> the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
and I placed it first in line on the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.520 
and I placed it first in line on the
pedal<00:00:31.910> board<00:00:31.960> let's<00:00:32.960> see<00:00:33.110> if<00:00:33.199> it<00:00:33.320> made<00:00:33.500> a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
pedal board let's see if it made a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.010 
pedal board let's see if it made a
difference<00:00:34.120> right<00:00:35.120> now<00:00:35.330> I'm<00:00:35.420> going<00:00:35.600> straight

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
difference right now I'm going straight

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.840 
difference right now I'm going straight
into<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.350> amp<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.739> give<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:37.129> an<00:00:37.190> example<00:00:37.580> of

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
into the amp to give you an example of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.410 
into the amp to give you an example of
what<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:38.629> sounds<00:00:39.020> like<00:00:39.260> with<00:00:40.010> no<00:00:40.250> pedals<00:00:40.670> no

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
what it sounds like with no pedals no

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.580 

okay<00:01:04.550> now<00:01:05.000> I'm<00:01:05.120> going<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.449> run<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:06.320> through

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
okay now I'm going to run just through

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.760 
okay now I'm going to run just through
the<00:01:06.710> pedals<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.870> all<00:01:08.870> my<00:01:09.080> pedals<00:01:09.470> are

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
the pedals and all my pedals are

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.080 
the pedals and all my pedals are
true-bypass<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.610> even<00:01:13.940> though

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
true-bypass so but even though

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.660 
true-bypass so but even though
true-bypass<00:01:14.870> that<00:01:15.620> that<00:01:15.890> does<00:01:16.070> not<00:01:16.100> mean<00:01:16.460> it's

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
true-bypass that that does not mean it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.850 
true-bypass that that does not mean it's
not<00:01:16.760> affecting<00:01:17.360> your<00:01:17.480> signal<00:01:17.930> sorry<00:01:18.620> about

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860

that
we're<00:01:19.520> not<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.820> lucky<00:01:20.360> but<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.200> would<00:01:21.380> be

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
we're not that lucky but this would be

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.930 
we're not that lucky but this would be
just<00:01:22.010> running<00:01:22.490> through<00:01:22.729> all<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.120> pedals<00:01:23.510> and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
just running through all the pedals and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.090 
just running through all the pedals and
let's<00:01:25.940> listen<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
and I can tell that the tone is not as

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.820 
and I can tell that the tone is not as
bright<00:01:34.440> as<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.890> before

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.320 

even<00:01:39.830> lost<00:01:40.040> some<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.369> its<00:01:40.549> guts<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.090> seemed

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330

even lost some of its guts it seemed
like<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.070> has<00:01:43.280> gone<00:01:43.460> through

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
like but and now this has gone through

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.450 
like but and now this has gone through
the<00:01:44.060> buffer<00:01:44.450> pedal<00:01:44.900> from<00:01:45.020> cement<00:01:45.530> mods<00:01:45.799> let's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
the buffer pedal from cement mods let's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.550 
the buffer pedal from cement mods let's
see<00:01:46.640> if<00:01:46.700> we've<00:01:46.850> regained<00:01:47.240> some<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.630> our<00:01:47.810> tone
