00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.170
 In this chapter we are going to talk about the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.690
 fishing with popper's pop fishing and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.500
 fishing with poppers basically 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.779
 it is a fishing coin to haul the power 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 It is an artificial bait 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.619
 Finished flat directly a little 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.419
 inward they converted an action 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.730
 when we bring it to us what 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.930
 does it raise a lot of water 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.300
 sensation from below that is a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.250
 predator that is looking for fish 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.450
 small the water is jumping forward 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.460
 from below 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.379
 we see the predator and a series of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.820
 droplets in front of you jumping these 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.530
 it seems that they are the tiny fish that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 is attacking the east the most predator 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.659
 large will rise and attack you on the surface 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.309
 what is to the popper to our lure is 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.780
 very spectacular this type of fishing is 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.659
 we almost always see the chopped up 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.829
 of the water and really attractive 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.050
 basically the fishing we do in the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.120
 tropic with popper's is for fish type 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.489
 farm and 2 and by the ram type of all 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.499
 life and stylize popper's so much more 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.150
 great that we forget here that displace 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.729
 a lot of water that we can throw away 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.890
 directly they are strong resistant and 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.650
 with enough weight in which we ride 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 large hooks we are going to 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 lower weights a little bit bigger because 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.330
 we are used to our coasts 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.300
 but that our things can work 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.810
 from coopers more bits 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.700
 for fish like anchovy for fish like 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.380
 the lilies is a really really fishing 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 very funny very spectacular its little 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.060
 it's more medium directly and even 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.530
 even for the muddy times that only 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.600
 touch when they go upstairs to eat 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.370
 we have little poppers to pull 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.440
 whenever we see of sea ​​then in river 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.000
 obviously another series another series of 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.830
 fish that are going to attack us directly 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.750
 also to our poppers 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.790
 popping fishing really is a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 fishing throwing and picking throwing and 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.970
 pick when you should use 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 obviously when we see that the water 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.270
 it is quiet when we see that the water 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280
 it is not too high for the fish 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 from below you can see above our 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.940
 new artificial if we are in a day 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 very very bad little is that we 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 we have a paper and we started to throw the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.090
 pc below will only see the water at 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.860
 get removed is very difficult very difficult to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.510
 focus on our popper's then 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 the day we see the water that is 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.610
 planet that little activity or who wants 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.260
 which are not very moved 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.700
 let's use the popes or when 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.620
 let's really see that there is a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.120
 mole of big fish that are eating 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.770
 above surface is our increase 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 then let's go for the priests 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.850
 we advise a lot much about all this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.260
 type of fishing is little extended 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.810
 that in Spain 'reality that uses little 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.810
 but really very very very funny
