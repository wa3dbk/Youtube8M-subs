once<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.219> connected<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:32.910> entire

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
once you have connected your entire

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
once you have connected your entire
gallon<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.629> world<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.410> computer<00:00:34.950> let's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gallon your world to your computer let's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
gallon your world to your computer let's
check<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.290> appears<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.920> valine<00:00:38.309> X<00:00:38.460> file

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
check if it appears in valine X file

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.530 
check if it appears in valine X file
system<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:41.879> display<00:00:42.239> all

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
system so to do so we will display all

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.280 
system so to do so we will display all
files<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:44.160> dev<00:00:44.399> directory<00:00:45.079> which<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
files in the dev directory which is a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.569 
files in the dev directory which is a
file<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.329> devices<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> Linux<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:49.579> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
file where all devices in Linux are so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.030 
file where all devices in Linux are so
for<00:00:50.850> example<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> plug<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> USB<00:00:52.110> key<00:00:52.769> to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
for example when you plug a USB key to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.610 
for example when you plug a USB key to
your<00:00:53.159> computer<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.449> appear<00:00:54.839> as<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> file

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
your computer it will appear as a file

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.469 
your computer it will appear as a file
in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.610> dev<00:00:56.820> directory<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.640> we<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
in the dev directory so here we have a

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.430 
in the dev directory so here we have a
file

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
file

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
ttyl a CM zero which is our Intel

ttyl a CM zero which is our Intel
Galileo<00:01:05.070> board<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.070> basically<00:01:14.729> report

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
Galileo board this is basically report

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.370 
Galileo board this is basically report
that<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.100> arduino<00:01:17.640> ide<00:01:18.380> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that we will use in the arduino ide to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.100 
that we will use in the arduino ide to
run<00:01:20.179> execute<00:01:21.179> some<00:01:21.960> demo<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> let's<00:01:24.390> start<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
run execute some demo so let's start the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
run execute some demo so let's start the
arduino<00:01:25.740> ide<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.690> go<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:28.200> tools<00:01:28.649> board<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
arduino ide and go to tools board to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.719 
arduino ide and go to tools board to
check<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.050> inter<00:01:31.409> Galil<00:01:31.770> board<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
check that the inter Galil board is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.800 
check that the inter Galil board is
connected<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.800> ok<00:01:35.330> let's<00:01:36.330> verify<00:01:36.539> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
connected so it's ok let's verify that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.499 
connected so it's ok let's verify that
the<00:01:37.610> sample<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.789> empty

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the sample and empty

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.449 
the sample and empty
code<00:01:39.989> forward<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.739> know<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.069> compiling<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
code forward we know is compiling and

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.630 
code forward we know is compiling and
can<00:01:44.459> be<00:01:44.640> upload<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> board<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.310> ok<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can be upload to the board and ok the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.839 
can be upload to the board and ok the
transfer<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> complete<00:01:49.580> let's<00:01:50.580> try<00:01:50.789> to

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
transfer is complete let's try to

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.070 
transfer is complete let's try to
compile<00:01:51.300> an<00:01:51.450> example<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:53.250> example<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.789> basic

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
compile an example for example the basic

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.749 
compile an example for example the basic
blink<00:01:55.080> demo<00:01:55.880> which<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.910> basically<00:01:57.539> how<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
blink demo which is basically how to

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
blink demo which is basically how to
blink<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.970> LED<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> Galileo<00:02:01.500> board<00:02:03.619> click

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
blink an LED on the Galileo board click

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.800 
blink an LED on the Galileo board click
on<00:02:04.770> verify<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.729> click<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.239> upload<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.629> can

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
on verify and click on upload as you can

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.030 
on verify and click on upload as you can
see<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.289> transfer<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> complete<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:13.040> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
see the transfer is complete and you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.670 
see the transfer is complete and you
should<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.970> board<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:16.140> LED

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
should see on your board the LED

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:41.250 
should see on your board the LED
blinking

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.319
