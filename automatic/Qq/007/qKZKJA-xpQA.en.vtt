00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Well, all of us guys are here in one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.580
 episode of dap and supercar ones 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.580
 of the xx matrix 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:16.080
 as you can see the king of is started 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:21.140
 the rings and we're losing 3 to 0 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.000
 we lost 3 to 0 management on this 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 the female is pretty good though 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.390
 example we could change it we want 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.880
 replace it and even style oars could 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 go to vision cold ok 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.559
 meanwhile we will be able to give energy to whom 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.559
 need 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.309
 ok not to block everything perfect 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.989
 let's see how many games we won 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.989
 ranking we are 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.690
 we use these last simona ads 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.640
 they don't tell us I didn't recognize the name 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.880
 goals 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 we are two victories a defeat we are 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 third 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 we are downed almost almost all 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.480
 however, at least we are open from 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 Meanwhile, 42 minutes to the next one 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:33.600
 game and we must play against against 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.700
 omar amara that position is omar omar 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 is latest 14 th so we're cool 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.780
 we will have to win 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 ok meanwhile we can see here 25 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.190
 wins a defeat as we have 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.940
 made to lose I don't know oh well let's go 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.650
 Meanwhile, the performance still is not 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.020
 marrara flight that I show it 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.760
 we design matteo the only two Italians 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 in the same game at the classroom and matteo 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.190
 saw Matthew because Matthew matera more 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.670
 beautiful strength then Baptist I lost not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.070
 we won 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:21.660
 draw charisma existence because not 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.960
 the dissent of kappa is delayed 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.010
 Yeah, for sure 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:35.900
 21 have been tied 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.900
 hold'em speed resistance 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.840
 well 3 to 1 better than that could not 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.739
 to go 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.500
 ok we don't want the cards because he 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.500
 I want to do a special pact correspondence 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.860
 in fact I will take me forward offline and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.470
 I'll make a single episode of shoes to play you 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:06.970
 we will export about fifty 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.970
 ok let's go ahead challenging resistance 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:16.849
 instead they lost no big batista 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.739
 force or judges award c 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.799
 game by john beautiful dinner we would like a 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.329
 so a common way is stronger than mine 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:48.430
 major league and draw 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:48.430
 ok, first ok to burej go little charisma 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:06.310
 passes a little 2 to 0 but it 's okay so well 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.560
 or the ior and mysterio proceeded 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 therefore inserting what we have lost 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:18.820
 in fact 11 but speed resistance a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.230
 danger for the colander danger for 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.580
 the perfect okay perfect 3 to 1 does not 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.430
 21 rooms we are already six cards nothing 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.200
 which however big ivybridge bulbs places 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.370
 hopefully when we do the special 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.950
 cards we will also get to overcome 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.950
 let's hope maybe speed 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.540
 we lost don't tell me I 'm fine 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.490
 because I always say we have lost not 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:58.170
 it means of cappato 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:00.380
 that's why I say he lost 1 a 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.380
 1 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:11.550
 ok we should have won just like that 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.910
 one for change we are certainly many 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.890
 games have a nice episode diego 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:24.270
 diego milito 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:26.529
 nico palasio strength charisma because not 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.919
 use but the cards when I have to use them 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:34.629
 dk between tourism and destruction of the world 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:42.159
 ok 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:43.179
 strength karim beach is always all john 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.009
 dinner 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:47.619
 meanwhile we are giving up silly mysterio non 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.669
 is that it is much worse 

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:50.669
 soon 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:08.949
 oh well conceivable you to say is not 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:10.479
 just bad two defeats in the 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.330
 probook I dress because we lost the 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.919
 ours was the strongest of bard 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.850
 however we refer back to this as of 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:21.240
 started from which I want to win 3 to 0 in 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.710
 this bet never won 3 to 0 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.820
 ok no you don't tell me i'm not up to it 0 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.090
 I want to win 3 0 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.380
 I want to win 3 to 0 every twenty meters a 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.229
 zero does not bring a cock oh well we have 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.300
 won we don't give a damn guys 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.440
 so we will never lose them 50 mortine ok 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.479
 11 looks to open for this video is 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.289
 everything is not everything then go to 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.289
 see another thing 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.000
 that you want to go from nothing to 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.460
 whale ok for this I leave everything 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.740
 I like and watch videos because one 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.440
 beautiful series trust you will become beautiful 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.200
 when we have all the cards go over goes 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.880
 well I advise you to look at it because 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.370
 however it will be the only serious cloth though 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.950
 said up for a long time until 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.990
 complete playstation 4 or fake is no longer 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.690
 strange case centers forward reasons 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.790
 anyway, that's why it's not me 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.870
 everyone likes it but just because anyway 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:27.820
