that<00:01:11.580> even<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> power<00:01:12.689> function<00:01:13.110> system

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that even in the power function system

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
that even in the power function system
because<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> backwards<00:01:14.670> compatible

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
because there is a backwards compatible

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
because there is a backwards compatible

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
like cables and I have a little hole for
that<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.250> there's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> hole<00:01:41.549> design<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.150> the

grills and their stuff and the creative
Liberty<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> took<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.050> designing<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
Liberty I took in designing this just to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.760 
Liberty I took in designing this just to
make<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.420> slanted<00:02:52.640> section<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.790> nose

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.720 

and<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.760> background<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.420> my<00:03:01.730> layout

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and the background you can see my layout

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.370 
and the background you can see my layout
that<00:03:02.880> I'm<00:03:03.000> kind<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.330> tearing<00:03:03.720> down<00:03:03.750> because<00:03:04.260> of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
that I'm kind of tearing down because of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.540 
that I'm kind of tearing down because of
the<00:03:04.440> Christmas<00:03:04.680> season<00:03:06.860> but<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.100> hope<00:03:08.220> my

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the Christmas season but I hope my

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.970 
the Christmas season but I hope my
Christmas<00:03:09.030> layout<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> boost<00:03:09.980> with

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
Christmas layout can get a boost with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.090 
Christmas layout can get a boost with
this<00:03:11.190> locomotive<00:03:12.590> even<00:03:13.590> though<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:13.920> not

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
this locomotive even though it's not

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
this locomotive even though it's not
really<00:03:14.310> designed<00:03:14.520> for<00:03:14.850> these<00:03:14.970> sure<00:03:15.239> it's<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
really designed for these sure it's just

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.660 
really designed for these sure it's just
not<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.200> unit<00:03:16.500> has<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.489> see<00:03:20.640> I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
not that this unit has you can see I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.320 
not that this unit has you can see I
designed<00:03:21.030> some<00:03:21.239> holes<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.549> wiring<00:03:23.549> it's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
designed some holes for the wiring it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.080 
designed some holes for the wiring it's
gonna<00:03:24.510> go<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.049> sort<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> up-down

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
gonna go in a sort of up-down

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.850 
gonna go in a sort of up-down
rollercoaster<00:03:27.090> style<00:03:27.360> fashion<00:03:27.660> there<00:03:28.650> should

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
rollercoaster style fashion there should

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.150 
rollercoaster style fashion there should
be<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> hole<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:30.470> assembled<00:03:31.470> section<00:03:31.920> here

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
be a hole in the assembled section here

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.740 
be a hole in the assembled section here
so<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.910> wires<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.420> go<00:03:33.540> through<00:03:35.600> these<00:03:36.600> are

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
so the wires can go through these are

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.590 
so the wires can go through these are
the<00:03:36.870> two<00:03:37.019> sections<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.560> extracted<00:03:38.480> parts<00:03:39.480> of

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the two sections I extracted parts of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.250 
the two sections I extracted parts of
long<00:03:39.750> hood<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:41.100> radios<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:42.510> these

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
long hood and the radios now these

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.780 
long hood and the radios now these
particular<00:03:43.500> grilles<00:03:44.190> could<00:03:44.549> have<00:03:44.640> been

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
particular grilles could have been

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.690 
particular grilles could have been
constructed<00:03:45.450> easily<00:03:46.260> but<00:03:47.220> because<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.579> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
constructed easily but because of the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.330 
constructed easily but because of the
wires<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.120> went<00:03:48.299> above<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.540> beyond<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:50.160> made

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
wires I went above and beyond and made

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.960 
wires I went above and beyond and made
it<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.579> kind<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:52.010> construction<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.850> there

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
it a kind of you construction so there

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.310 
it a kind of you construction so there
could<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.150> space<00:03:54.420> for<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.660> wire<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:55.079> through

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
could be space for a wire to go through

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.120 
could be space for a wire to go through
and<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:57.150> goes<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:57.959> top<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.829> being

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
and this goes on top of this is being

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.729 
and this goes on top of this is being
reassembled<00:03:59.959> here's<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.079> look<00:04:01.320> at<00:04:01.470> how<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
reassembled here's a look at how the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.420 
reassembled here's a look at how the
center<00:04:02.640> section<00:04:02.850> looks<00:04:03.269> where<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.750> have<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
center section looks where you have the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.120 
center section looks where you have the
flow<00:04:05.430> for<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.730> wires<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.650> from<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.950> cab

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
flow for the wires so from the cab

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.940 
flow for the wires so from the cab
you'll<00:04:08.310> go<00:04:08.549> up<00:04:08.820> through<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.510> section<00:04:10.380> under

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you'll go up through that section under

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.720 
you'll go up through that section under
the<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.340> frame<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.239> upper<00:04:13.110> grills<00:04:13.730> down

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the you frame of the upper grills down

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.830 
the you frame of the upper grills down
through<00:04:15.000> there<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.480> up<00:04:15.600> through<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
through there and then up through the
