00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
reddit for me it's easier on this one

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.749 
reddit for me it's easier on this one
you<00:01:43.899> could<00:01:44.110> put<00:01:44.259> extra<00:01:44.530> some<00:01:44.800> with<00:01:44.979> smoothing

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
you could put extra some with smoothing

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.330 
you could put extra some with smoothing
but<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.780> now<00:01:46.960> I'm<00:01:47.080> not<00:01:47.110> because<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:48.009> takes<00:01:48.190> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
but right now I'm not because it takes a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.660 
but right now I'm not because it takes a
while<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:49.479> process<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:50.170> smoothie<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.520> want

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
while to process the smoothie so I want
