00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
saw the reviews the curl pattern is more

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.850 
saw the reviews the curl pattern is more
of<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.160> way<00:04:11.430> than<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> curl<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.170> pretty<00:04:13.500> curly

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
of a way than a curl it is pretty curly

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.310 
of a way than a curl it is pretty curly
right<00:04:14.040> now<00:04:14.160> but<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.670> feeling<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:16.049> they

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
right now but I have a feeling that they

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.219 
right now but I have a feeling that they
will<00:04:16.560> fall<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.310> become<00:04:17.820> much<00:04:18.600> more<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:18.959> a

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
will fall and become much more of a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.520 
will fall and become much more of a
relaxed<00:04:20.010> wave<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.810> really<00:04:22.079> ever<00:04:22.320> really

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
relaxed wave but I really ever really

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.260 
relaxed wave but I really ever really
don't<00:04:22.740> mind<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.070> especially<00:04:23.580> for<00:04:23.760> flaw<00:04:23.970> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
don't mind that especially for flaw and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.110 
don't mind that especially for flaw and
it<00:04:24.479> looks<00:04:24.750> kind<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.140> like<00:04:25.350> if<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.640> if<00:04:26.910> you've

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
it looks kind of like if you if you've

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.909 
it looks kind of like if you if you've
done<00:04:27.330> your<00:04:27.479> hair<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.810> you've<00:04:27.900> curled<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.440> like
