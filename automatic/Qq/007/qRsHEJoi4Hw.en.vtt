Sony because they can never make a good
advertisement<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.570> know<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.690> they'll

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
advertisement I don't know if they'll

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.320 
advertisement I don't know if they'll
ever<00:02:40.989> make<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.530> again<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.100> because<00:02:43.000> the

ever make one again and because the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.479 
ever make one again and because the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
advertising is just horrible I think the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.460 
advertising is just horrible I think the
system's<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.120> sell<00:02:46.390> off<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.020> name<00:02:47.230> itself

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
system's just sell off the name itself

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.100 
system's just sell off the name itself
because<00:02:48.130> if<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.370> wasn't<00:02:48.700> for<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.000> no<00:02:49.900> one

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
because if it wasn't for that no one

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
because if it wasn't for that no one
would<00:02:50.200> buy<00:02:50.410> them<00:02:50.590> what<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.190> advertising<00:02:51.670> is

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
because I was so into dead space I was

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.230

like<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.720> gotta<00:04:34.230> play<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.740> dead<00:04:34.950> space<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.520> my

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
like I gotta play the dead space and my

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.060 
like I gotta play the dead space and my
my<00:04:36.510> 360<00:04:36.990> doesn't<00:04:37.230> have<00:04:37.350> dead<00:04:37.560> space<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.040> I

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
my 360 doesn't have dead space so I

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.830 
my 360 doesn't have dead space so I
grabbed<00:04:38.460> my<00:04:38.610> ps3<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.330> threw<00:04:39.600> in<00:04:39.720> my
