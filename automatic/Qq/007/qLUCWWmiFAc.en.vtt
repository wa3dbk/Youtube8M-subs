make<00:01:05.269> sure<00:01:05.449> you<00:01:05.570> know<00:01:05.720> where<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:05.960> knife<00:01:06.110> is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
make sure you know where the knife is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.639 
make sure you know where the knife is
going<00:01:06.560> when<00:01:07.340> you're<00:01:07.490> cutting<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:08.090> thought<00:01:08.689> well

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
going when you're cutting I thought well

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.319 
going when you're cutting I thought well
I'm<00:01:10.219> not<00:01:10.310> too<00:01:10.520> careful<00:01:10.700> here<00:01:11.090> I'll<00:01:11.210> probably

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
I'm not too careful here I'll probably

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.469 
I'm not too careful here I'll probably
cut<00:01:11.600> my<00:01:11.719> finger<00:01:12.610> these<00:01:13.610> things<00:01:13.850> which<00:01:14.120> I<00:01:14.299> did

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
cut my finger these things which I did

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.620 
cut my finger these things which I did
anyway<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:17.510> moves<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.870> pen<00:01:18.110> along<00:01:19.630> keeping

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
anyway it moves the pen along keeping

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.760 
anyway it moves the pen along keeping
your<00:01:20.840> pressure<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> bottom<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.060> case

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
your pressure on the bottom of the case

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.420 
your pressure on the bottom of the case
and<00:01:24.770> you'll<00:01:24.920> end<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:26.140> with<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.200> nice<00:01:27.350> line<00:01:27.890> going

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and you'll end up with a nice line going

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.460 
and you'll end up with a nice line going
all<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.729> way<00:01:28.760> around<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.119> system<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:30.260> then

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
all the way around the system this then

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.620 
all the way around the system this then
gives<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.860> good<00:01:31.070> guide<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.970> order<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.390> cut

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
gives you a good guide in order to cut

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.820 
gives you a good guide in order to cut
he<00:01:33.590> cut<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:34.310> above<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.940> line<00:01:35.090> itself<00:01:35.830> and

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
he cut just above the line itself and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.050 
he cut just above the line itself and
then<00:01:36.979> afterwards<00:01:37.369> we're<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.700> sand<00:01:37.939> it

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
then afterwards we're going to sand it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.810 
then afterwards we're going to sand it
flat<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:39.049> it's<00:01:39.200> all<00:01:39.409> nice<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.590> smooth<00:01:39.979> and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
flat so it's all nice and smooth and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.399 
flat so it's all nice and smooth and
level<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> top<00:01:44.750> part<00:01:44.990> nearly

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
level and this is the top part nearly

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.420 
level and this is the top part nearly
complete<00:01:45.890> my<00:01:46.490> firm<00:01:46.909> used<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:48.140> sanding<00:01:48.890> drum<00:01:49.100> on

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
complete my firm used a sanding drum on

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.510 
complete my firm used a sanding drum on
the<00:01:49.490> Dremel<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.360> get<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.049> sides<00:01:51.799> pretty<00:01:52.280> good

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the Dremel to get the sides pretty good

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.050 
the Dremel to get the sides pretty good
and<00:01:53.150> then<00:01:53.390> rub<00:01:53.720> them<00:01:53.869> along<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
and then rub them along this on the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.929 
and then rub them along this on the
sandpaper<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:57.680> result<00:01:58.070> is<00:01:58.250> very<00:01:58.280> very<00:01:58.640> smooth

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
sandpaper the result is very very smooth

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.859 
sandpaper the result is very very smooth
indeed<00:02:00.670> I'm<00:02:01.670> going<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.909> do<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> same<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
indeed I'm going to do the same with the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.429 
indeed I'm going to do the same with the
bottom<00:02:03.170> half<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.310> also<00:02:04.640> cut<00:02:04.909> all<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> holes

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
bottom half and I also cut all the holes

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.679 
bottom half and I also cut all the holes
we're<00:02:06.439> then<00:02:06.590> going<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.890> connect<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.149> two<00:02:08.360> case

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:08.689 
we're then going to connect the two case

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.600 
we're then going to connect the two case

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.250 
I put the screen onto the board and then
just<00:02:26.440> tied<00:02:26.740> through<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.460> little<00:02:27.670> bit<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.820> wire

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
just tied through a little bit of wire

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.090 
just tied through a little bit of wire
to<00:02:29.260> connect<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> two

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
to connect the two

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.580 
to connect the two
this<00:02:30.610> means<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.060> position<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.380> board

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
this means I can position the board

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.180 
this means I can position the board
exactly<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.220> place<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.840> then<00:02:35.260> mark<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.920> each

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
exactly in place and then mark on each

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000 
exactly in place and then mark on each
of<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> corners<00:02:36.970> where<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.020> screen<00:02:38.320> rests

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
of the corners where the screen rests

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.670 
of the corners where the screen rests
although<00:02:39.940> that's<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.630> perimeter<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
although that's the perimeter of the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.280 
although that's the perimeter of the
screen<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.760> will<00:02:42.820> then<00:02:43.030> give<00:02:43.300> us<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.600> gauge<00:02:43.810> to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
screen it will then give us the gauge to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.520 
screen it will then give us the gauge to
work<00:02:44.620> out<00:02:44.830> where<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.930> visible<00:02:46.930> screen<00:02:47.170> area

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
work out where the visible screen area

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.060 
work out where the visible screen area
is<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:49.120> order<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> do<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.990> nice<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.440> easily

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.780 

we<00:02:54.070> here's<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.380> tracing<00:02:56.380> from<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.340> original

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
we here's the tracing from the original

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.010 
we here's the tracing from the original
screen<00:02:58.120> if<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.170> turn<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> around<00:02:59.650> you<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
screen if you turn it around you see the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.340 
screen if you turn it around you see the
areas<00:03:02.440> these<00:03:03.400> tabs<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.910> where<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.960> screen

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
areas these tabs here where the screen

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.950 
areas these tabs here where the screen
would<00:03:05.530> normally<00:03:05.830> be<00:03:05.980> held<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.300> if<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.690> cut

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
would normally be held into so if we cut

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
would normally be held into so if we cut
these<00:03:08.860> parts<00:03:09.610> off<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.990> also<00:03:11.170> reduce<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.740> size

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
these parts off and also reduce the size

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.190 
these parts off and also reduce the size
of<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:13.390> end<00:03:13.570> up<00:03:13.690> with<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> master

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.740 
of this you end up with a master
template<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.030> then<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:16.270> inside<00:03:16.420> the

I'm utilizing the mica control pad a
super<00:04:03.400> 64<00:04:03.760> pad<00:04:04.380> really<00:04:05.380> because<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.190> buttons

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
super 64 pad really because the buttons

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.420 
super 64 pad really because the buttons
on<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.820> here<00:04:07.000> are<00:04:07.209> very<00:04:07.540> flat<00:04:08.110> as<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.070> causes

buttons effectively are in a diamond

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.810 
buttons effectively are in a diamond
shape<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.700> need<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.450> be<00:04:19.600> square<00:04:19.930> so<00:04:20.669> what<00:04:21.669> I'm

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
shape I need it to be square so what I'm

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.610 
shape I need it to be square so what I'm
going<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.000> do<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.720> cut<00:04:22.900> out<00:04:23.050> each<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.530> these

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
going to do is to cut out each of these

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.570 
going to do is to cut out each of these
individual<00:04:24.310> holes<00:04:25.290> with<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.320> support<00:04:26.740> because

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
individual holes with a support because

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.370 
individual holes with a support because
on<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.790> back<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.150> them<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:28.750> have<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.050> slots

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
on the back of them we have the slots

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.680 
on the back of them we have the slots
which<00:04:29.860> corresponds<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.970> slots<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.510> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
which corresponds to the slots in the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.779 
which corresponds to the slots in the
buttons<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.919> stops<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.250> buttons<00:04:33.669> from

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
buttons and that stops the buttons from

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.360 
buttons and that stops the buttons from
rotating<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:35.470> each<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.650> these<00:04:35.919> will<00:04:36.310> be

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
rotating so each of these will be

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.850 
rotating so each of these will be
positioned<00:04:37.120> inside<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.930> case

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
positioned inside the case

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.070 
positioned inside the case
send<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> down<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> buttons<00:04:40.900> aren't

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
send it down so that the buttons aren't

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.469 
send it down so that the buttons aren't
too<00:04:41.260> high<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.820> I've<00:04:42.940> literally<00:04:43.240> just

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
too high and I've literally just

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.380 
too high and I've literally just
utilized<00:04:43.990> them<00:04:44.440> as<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> template<00:04:45.100> in<00:04:45.820> order<00:04:46.210> to

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
utilized them as a template in order to

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.080 
utilized them as a template in order to
then<00:04:46.570> know<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.470> areas<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.800> need<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.039> cut<00:04:48.250> out<00:04:48.460> in

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
then know the areas I need to cut out in

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.490 
then know the areas I need to cut out in
fact<00:04:49.300> everything<00:04:49.630> that's<00:04:49.780> black<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.350> this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
fact everything that's black on this

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.270 
fact everything that's black on this
part<00:04:50.800> will<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.700> cut<00:04:52.240> through<00:04:53.039> for<00:04:54.039> the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
part will be cut through for the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.090 
part will be cut through for the
joystick<00:04:54.940> area<00:04:55.350> I'm<00:04:56.350> not<00:04:56.530> going<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.830> use<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
joystick area I'm not going to use the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.290 
joystick area I'm not going to use the
official<00:04:57.310> one<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.640> don't<00:04:57.820> particularly<00:04:58.180> like

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
official one I don't particularly like

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.020 
official one I don't particularly like
it<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:58.990> I'm<00:04:59.620> using<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.039> third-party<00:05:00.280> controller

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
it so I'm using a third-party controller

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.940 
it so I'm using a third-party controller
and<00:05:01.390> therefore<00:05:02.110> I'm<00:05:02.229> also<00:05:02.410> going<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.710> use<00:05:02.919> a

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
and therefore I'm also going to use a

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.310 
and therefore I'm also going to use a
third-party<00:05:03.570> joystick<00:05:04.570> which<00:05:04.960> I'll<00:05:05.169> provide

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
third-party joystick which I'll provide

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
third-party joystick which I'll provide
more<00:05:05.650> details<00:05:06.070> on<00:05:06.220> later<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:07.510> original

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
more details on later the original

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.360 
more details on later the original
playstation<00:05:09.340> controller<00:05:09.490> for<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.539> sony<00:05:10.750> one

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
playstation controller for the sony one

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.730 
playstation controller for the sony one
has<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.400> nice<00:05:12.669> support<00:05:13.060> area<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:14.260> support<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
has a nice support area to support the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.740 
has a nice support area to support the
board<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:16.060> therefore<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.479> can<00:05:16.690> be

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
board and therefore this can be

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.510 
board and therefore this can be
installed<00:05:17.200> in<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.380> system<00:05:17.620> quite<00:05:17.979> easily<00:05:18.190> I

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
installed in the system quite easily I

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.490 
installed in the system quite easily I
quite<00:05:18.820> comfortably<00:05:19.330> therefore<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.350> seems

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
quite comfortably therefore it seems

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.290 
quite comfortably therefore it seems
logical<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:21.250> make<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.729> hole<00:05:21.910> for<00:05:21.940> the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
logical to make the hole for the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.240 
logical to make the hole for the
position<00:05:22.720> in<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.740> case<00:05:25.800> this<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:26.950> just<00:05:27.130> a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
position in the case this is just a

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.130 
position in the case this is just a
mock-up<00:05:27.490> so<00:05:27.700> hella<00:05:28.300> straight<00:05:28.570> how<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.960> will

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
mock-up so hella straight how it will

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.659 
mock-up so hella straight how it will
look<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:29.500> looks<00:05:29.620> quite<00:05:29.860> crude<00:05:30.100> at<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.310> moment

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
look it looks quite crude at the moment

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.490 
look it looks quite crude at the moment
I<00:05:30.850> wish<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.419> just<00:05:31.570> put<00:05:31.780> all<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.990> buttons<00:05:32.320> in

a nice Glide don't quite sort of small

a nice Glide don't quite sort of small
files<00:06:45.160> but<00:06:45.520> they're<00:06:45.639> very<00:06:45.850> very<00:06:45.940> good<00:06:46.139> and

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
files but they're very very good and

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.290 
files but they're very very good and
then<00:06:47.290> for<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.500> move<00:06:47.680> all<00:06:47.950> of<00:06:48.130> the<00:06:48.400> marks<00:06:49.060> from

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
then for a move all of the marks from

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.830 
then for a move all of the marks from
the<00:06:49.710> CD<00:06:50.710> pan<00:06:50.950> just<00:06:51.850> use<00:06:52.090> a<00:06:52.120> standard<00:06:52.360> pence<00:06:52.720> for

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
the CD pan just use a standard pence for

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:02.280 
the CD pan just use a standard pence for
the<00:06:52.930> rows<00:06:53.110> up<00:06:58.560> and<00:06:59.560> this<00:06:59.740> is<00:06:59.950> si<00:07:00.780> the<00:07:01.780> result<00:07:02.110> so

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
the rows up and this is si the result so

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.370 
the rows up and this is si the result so
far<00:07:03.180> there's<00:07:04.180> more<00:07:04.389> holes<00:07:04.630> required<00:07:05.139> to<00:07:05.290> be

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
far there's more holes required to be

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.940 
far there's more holes required to be
cut<00:07:05.590> out<00:07:05.800> speaker<00:07:06.370> holes<00:07:06.720> on<00:07:07.720> off<00:07:07.960> various

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
cut out speaker holes on off various

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.800 
cut out speaker holes on off various
other<00:07:09.130> ones<00:07:09.340> for<00:07:09.520> that<00:07:09.610> nature<00:07:10.030> but<00:07:10.330> you<00:07:10.690> can

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
other ones for that nature but you can

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.440 
other ones for that nature but you can
see<00:07:10.990> how<00:07:11.139> it's<00:07:11.290> progressing
