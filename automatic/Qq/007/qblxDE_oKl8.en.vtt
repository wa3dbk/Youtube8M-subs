00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
thank you yeah I have a question about

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.359 
thank you yeah I have a question about
this<00:01:20.820> defrosting<00:01:21.750> okay<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this defrosting okay this is I think the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.980 
this defrosting okay this is I think the
area<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.540> leave<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.960> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
area what can you not leave it out for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.050 
area what can you not leave it out for
at<00:01:25.710> room<00:01:25.860> temperature<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> under<00:01:26.909> hot

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
at room temperature I put it under hot

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.020 
at room temperature I put it under hot
water<00:01:27.380> well<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:29.009> let<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.610> up

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
water well actually let me back up

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.670 
water well actually let me back up
because<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> defrost<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.530> room

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
because when you defrost out at room

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200 
because when you defrost out at room
temperature<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:32.520> creating<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
temperature you're creating what you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.390 
temperature you're creating what you
