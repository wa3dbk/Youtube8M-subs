00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
close race at quarterback and that's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000 
close race at quarterback and that's
exciting<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.300> yeah<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.619> both<00:00:25.769> guys

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.769 
exciting for me yeah to see both guys
out<00:00:26.220> there<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.430> make<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> significant<00:00:27.660> amount

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
out there and make a significant amount

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
out there and make a significant amount
of<00:00:27.869> plays<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.289> scrimmage<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.310> was

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
of plays in that scrimmage that was

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.800 
of plays in that scrimmage that was
really<00:00:29.609> good<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.090> i<00:00:30.179> think<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> probably<00:00:30.599> still

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
really good so i think we probably still

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
really good so i think we probably still
a<00:00:30.900> couple<00:00:31.019> days<00:00:31.230> away<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> good<00:00:32.219> thing

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a couple days away is it a good thing

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
a couple days away is it a good thing
that's<00:00:32.520> become<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> tough<00:00:33.180> decision<00:00:33.710> hey<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that's become a tough decision hey I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
that's become a tough decision hey I
think<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.160> yeah<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> think

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
think it is yeah I think it is I think

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
think it is yeah I think it is I think
this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.520> good

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
this is a this is a really good

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
this is a this is a really good
situation<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.750> because

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
situation we have right now because

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
situation we have right now because
ultimately<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.800> don't<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:41.579> been

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
ultimately I don't know that I've been

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.830 
ultimately I don't know that I've been
here<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.969> season<00:00:42.300> where<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.480> haven't<00:00:42.719> needed

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
here a season where we haven't needed

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
here a season where we haven't needed
two<00:00:43.050> quarterbacks<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.800> whoever<00:00:44.340> ultimately

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
two quarterbacks so whoever ultimately

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
two quarterbacks so whoever ultimately
wins<00:00:45.000> wins<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> job<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.469> an

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
wins wins the job it's going to have an

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
wins wins the job it's going to have an
opportunity<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.039> grow<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> job<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
opportunity to grow in the job but

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.979 
opportunity to grow in the job but
there's<00:00:48.210> no<00:00:48.329> guarantee<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> guy

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
there's no guarantee that's the guy

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.119 
there's no guarantee that's the guy

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
quarterback i want to give them an

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
quarterback i want to give them an
opportunity<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.320> play<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:14.010> make<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> made

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
opportunity to play it make it made

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
opportunity to play it make it made
before<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> gets

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
before that you know so if it if it gets

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
before that you know so if it if it gets
made<00:01:17.159> before<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> won't<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
made before that then it won't back the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.609 
made before that then it won't back the
decision<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.080> moving<00:01:19.290> forward<00:01:19.530> at

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
decision because we're moving forward at

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.230 
decision because we're moving forward at
that<00:01:19.710> point<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.729> haven't<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that point but if we haven't then it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
that point but if we haven't then it
certainly<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:22.229> weigh<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.409> heavily

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
certainly will will weigh very heavily

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
certainly will will weigh very heavily
so<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.640> goes<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.390> next<00:01:24.570> couple<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> days

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so what goes in the next couple of days

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.149 
so what goes in the next couple of days
would<00:01:25.170> make<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> make<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> decision<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.009> guess

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
would make you make the decision i guess

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
would make you make the decision i guess
what<00:01:26.310> would<00:01:26.400> typically<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> watching

eventually put on a fair amount of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440 
eventually put on a fair amount of
weight<00:03:39.489> since<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.969> last<00:03:41.730> longer<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:43.030> could

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
weight since the last longer I could

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.569 
weight since the last longer I could
know<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:43.719> we<00:03:43.810> talked<00:03:44.079> about<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.500> past<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:45.370> that

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
know so we talked about the past is that

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.099 
know so we talked about the past is that
just<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.909> matter<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.510> maturing<00:03:47.019> and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
just a matter of the maturing and

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.690 
just a matter of the maturing and
growing<00:03:47.200> into<00:03:47.620> their<00:03:47.739> bodies<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.310> got<00:03:48.459> really

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
growing into their bodies you got really

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.770 
growing into their bodies you got really
close<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:50.799> guess<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.760> natural<00:03:52.180> maturation

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
close I guess the natural maturation

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.140 
close I guess the natural maturation
process<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.829> football<00:03:54.159> player<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.400> remember

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
process of a football player I remember

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.110 
process of a football player I remember
I<00:03:55.829> wasn't<00:03:56.829> here<00:03:56.950> when<00:03:57.040> eric<00:03:57.280> foster<00:03:57.519> got<00:03:57.879> here

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
I wasn't here when eric foster got here

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.399 
I wasn't here when eric foster got here
but<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.329> remember<00:03:58.569> people<00:03:58.780> talking<00:03:58.810> about<00:03:59.230> eric

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
but I remember people talking about eric

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.349 
but I remember people talking about eric
foster<00:03:59.590> coming<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.040> our<00:04:00.069> program<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.579> 250<00:04:01.269> +

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
foster coming on our program as a 250 +

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.869 
foster coming on our program as a 250 +
220<00:04:01.870> pound<00:04:02.019> linebacker<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.680> then<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> by<00:04:03.819> the

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
220 pound linebacker and then a by the

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.089 
220 pound linebacker and then a by the
time<00:04:04.090> he<00:04:04.180> was<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.329> senior<00:04:04.659> he<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.870> at<00:04:04.959> 265<00:04:05.680> 270

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
time he was a senior he was at 265 270

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.339 
time he was a senior he was at 265 270
pound<00:04:06.489> three-technique<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.629> i<00:04:07.659> think<00:04:08.079> it's

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
pound three-technique so i think it's

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.949 
pound three-technique so i think it's
the<00:04:08.500> natural<00:04:08.769> progression<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.969> a<00:04:10.659> football

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the natural progression of a football

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.629 
the natural progression of a football
player<00:04:11.139> somebody's<00:04:11.650> transform<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.459> little

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
player somebody's transform a little

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.949 
player somebody's transform a little
quicker<00:04:12.819> than<00:04:12.909> others<00:04:13.060> john<00:04:13.419> badik<00:04:13.750> he's

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
quicker than others john badik he's

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.409 
quicker than others john badik he's
probably<00:04:14.200> up<00:04:14.469> 25<00:04:15.310> pounds<00:04:15.730> since<00:04:16.209> when<00:04:16.359> he

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
probably up 25 pounds since when he

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.270 
probably up 25 pounds since when he
arrived<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.840> January<00:04:17.289> is<00:04:17.500> really<00:04:17.829> exciting

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and what I like about it is that we've

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.930 
and what I like about it is that we've
been<00:04:37.180> challenged<00:04:37.690> we've<00:04:38.289> had<00:04:38.440> some<00:04:38.740> really

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.800 
been challenged we've had some really
significantly<00:04:39.940> high<00:04:40.180> temperatures<00:04:40.659> out

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
significantly high temperatures out

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.850 
significantly high temperatures out
there<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> practice<00:04:41.440> field<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:41.770> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
there on the practice field for the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.950 
there on the practice field for the
scrimmage<00:04:42.099> all<00:04:42.820> those<00:04:43.180> things<00:04:43.240> harden<00:04:43.870> your

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
scrimmage all those things harden your

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.659

football Tina as you start training camp
and<00:04:45.849> and<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.780> think<00:04:46.990> that's<00:04:47.110> been<00:04:47.289> good<00:04:47.440> for<00:04:47.650> us

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
and and I think that's been good for us

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.350 
and and I think that's been good for us
I<00:04:47.860> don't<00:04:48.010> really<00:04:48.220> check<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.789> advanced<00:04:49.030> report

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.760 
I don't really check the advanced report

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
to see how foreign I'm one day at a time

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.320 
to see how foreign I'm one day at a time
there<00:04:51.070> in<00:04:51.130> training<00:04:51.370> camp<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:51.699> we'll<00:04:52.150> see<00:04:52.300> how

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
long it lasts for us but especially

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.990

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
strength that's for sure now Sebastian

is<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:15.120> nose<00:05:15.570> guard<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.110> Kwanzaa<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.500> playing

is a nose guard and Kwanzaa is playing
there<00:05:17.070> at<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.340> necessity<00:05:17.730> at<00:05:18.030> times<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:18.870> think

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
there at a necessity at times so I think

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.050 
there at a necessity at times so I think
Juan<00:05:19.890> zelans<00:05:20.160> probably<00:05:20.460> more<00:05:20.580> suited<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:20.880> be<00:05:21.030> a

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
Juan zelans probably more suited to be a

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.490 
Juan zelans probably more suited to be a
defensive<00:05:21.510> end<00:05:21.690> on<00:05:21.840> either<00:05:21.960> side<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.320> know

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
defensive end on either side you know

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.010 
defensive end on either side you know
whichever<00:05:22.680> side<00:05:22.980> he<00:05:23.070> has<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.250> plan<00:05:24.020> we're

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
whichever side he has a plan we're

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.750 
whichever side he has a plan we're
fortunate<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.470> Kwanzaa<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.160> explosive<00:05:26.520> that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
fortunate the Kwanzaa so explosive that

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.890 
fortunate the Kwanzaa so explosive that
he<00:05:26.910> can<00:05:27.060> go<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.240> there<00:05:27.450> when<00:05:27.570> we<00:05:27.630> need<00:05:27.780> them<00:05:27.810> to

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
he can go in there when we need them to

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.750 
he can go in there when we need them to
but<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.380> think<00:05:28.770> most<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.250> our<00:05:29.370> nose<00:05:29.520> guard

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
but I think most of our nose guard

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.860 
but I think most of our nose guard
body's<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.210> forward<00:05:30.540> will<00:05:30.660> look<00:05:30.780> like

scheduled<00:05:53.970> 1245<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:54.870> that<00:05:54.990> by<00:05:55.140> design<00:05:55.350> to<00:05:56.010> make

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
scheduled 1245 is that by design to make

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.520 
scheduled 1245 is that by design to make
sure<00:05:56.340> they<00:05:56.490> experience<00:05:57.150> as<00:05:57.870> it<00:05:58.290> could<00:05:58.410> be<00:05:58.440> very

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
sure they experience as it could be very

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.100 
sure they experience as it could be very
important<00:05:59.310> it's<00:05:59.760> not<00:05:59.940> by<00:06:00.180> design<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.780> terms<00:06:00.900> of

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
important it's not by design in terms of

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.110 
important it's not by design in terms of
trying<00:06:01.290> to<00:06:01.410> get<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.890> get<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.340> most<00:06:02.490> heat<00:06:02.700> it's

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
trying to get to get the most heat it's

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.090 
trying to get to get the most heat it's
when<00:06:03.360> we<00:06:03.450> put<00:06:03.630> training<00:06:03.810> camp<00:06:04.050> together<00:06:04.170> we

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
when we put training camp together we

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.530 
when we put training camp together we
try<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.340> look<00:06:05.460> at<00:06:05.610> an<00:06:05.730> optimal<00:06:06.120> time<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.480> the

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
try to look at an optimal time of the

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.240 
try to look at an optimal time of the
day<00:06:06.750> for<00:06:07.440> when<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.680> players<00:06:07.890> will<00:06:08.040> be<00:06:08.100> ready

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
day for when the players will be ready

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.710 
day for when the players will be ready
to<00:06:08.370> train<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:08.910> we've<00:06:09.060> got<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.210> lot<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.420> stuff<00:06:09.600> we

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
to train so we've got a lot of stuff we

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.930 
to train so we've got a lot of stuff we
do<00:06:09.810> in<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:09.990> mornings<00:06:10.260> it<00:06:10.380> leads<00:06:10.560> up<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.940> when

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
do in the mornings it leads up to when

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.160 
do in the mornings it leads up to when
we<00:06:12.060> practice<00:06:12.480> and<00:06:12.690> then<00:06:12.780> things<00:06:12.990> we<00:06:13.080> do

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
we practice and then things we do

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.210 
we practice and then things we do
afterwards<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.590> make<00:06:13.710> sure<00:06:13.800> we're<00:06:13.920> ready<00:06:13.980> for

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
afterwards to make sure we're ready for

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.010 
afterwards to make sure we're ready for
tomorrow<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.730> it's<00:06:14.880> really<00:06:15.000> more<00:06:15.270> more

tomorrow so it's really more more
focused<00:06:16.440> on<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.680> optimal<00:06:17.040> training<00:06:17.370> time

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
focused on the optimal training time

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.800 
focused on the optimal training time
than<00:06:17.670> it<00:06:17.760> is<00:06:17.850> what<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.120> what<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.390> conditions

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
than it is what the what the conditions

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.450 
than it is what the what the conditions
