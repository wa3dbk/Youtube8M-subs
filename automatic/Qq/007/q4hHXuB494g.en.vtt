00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.720
 much more because I love 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.320
 I commented on the why of a photo in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.320
 Facebook 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.950
 of Milan after and without eyebrows 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 and suddenly we make our church 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:37.220
 it's horrible natural and it's a great idea 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.270
 and how do I get more or less 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.760
 present to the public is recontra 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 simple 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 cheering can be done a human 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.429
 and I hope you like it 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.350

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.170
 [Music] 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.840
 this is moderately acceptable 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.600
 after Easter 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.680
 to enter this little 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.680
 [Music] 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.050
 when the queue is finished 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 scars 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.420
 and the members 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 [Music] 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.409
 what are we going to do without skill I have 23 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 years and I still have and as I see the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.640
 things for a good time like me 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.780
 the first thing is to win a first this case 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 random 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.750
 and now 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 next 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.790
 then what I do is apply the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.680
 corrector of the green in the whole area in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.680
 all scars and red marks 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:38.370
 One little thing my eyelash I had to wait 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:41.200
 the tab that I have I'm suffering 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.700
 we remove the green 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.970
 because it neutralizes the red 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.310
 [Music] 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.989
 you also have me in months and 90 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.330
 alonso green and the teeth apply the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.960
 base 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.960
 of mch 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.580
 [Music] 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 i 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.160
 [Music] 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.709
 a little bit of base is more than enough 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.830
 for the whole face but if yours 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.690
 has a very light coverage after 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.150
 from the first pass you can expect that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.770
 dry and you are adding more layers 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.770
 [Music] 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.879
 and it is recommended that you choose products 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.879
 according to your skin type 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.510
 and suddenly doing some some 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:03.030
 machines and in this case these that are 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.030
 quite new and then rector 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.689
 [Music] 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.540
 and it's better if you use a concealer 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.540
 the same tone as you do 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.190
 [Music] 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.640
 for other lights to have again 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 minimally 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.910
 and for the outlines he used one more pole 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.610
 dark that in addition to leaving a super look 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.409
 Matt seals the base better, preventing it from 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.620
 run with the course of the works 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.720
 to 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.720
 [Music] 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.710
 in this 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.090
 and here 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.090
 7 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.680
 [Music] 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.680
 I'll combine two of the ball 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.309
 [Music] 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.540
 [Music] 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 and that was it 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.720
 they are not ideas of thumb and up 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.850
 subscribe and leave me in the comments 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.010
 who would like to represent videos 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.139
 call instagram facebook what they want 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.830
 I'm on orders I do not want to ask 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.860
 doubt asked to weave but as always 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.870
 we put in that school good wave 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.870
 require what we know 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:19.669
 [Music] 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.669
 they saw it 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.669
 adviser
