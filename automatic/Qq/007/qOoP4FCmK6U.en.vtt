00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.309
 he is that he has d'ippolito at level 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.279
 we are going to create a box 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.279
 through 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.339
 after growing four 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 we click with the right button contact 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.789
 the pollin cable 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 we select a garden here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.120
 this vertex 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 selected 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 prohibited in four 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.020
 the account but with the celtics 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.240
 we found a 40 that give it away 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.800
 modify its parameters 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 we are here 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 ordinary 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 by very large influence 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 in this line 15 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:18.989
 in what is good or bad 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 then the 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.929
 dairy 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.429
 apply and we will continue with 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.429
 in active go releasing different 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.459
 cazorla is what there is 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.459
 we have only humber 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.229
 those very very used 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.229
 is the taxi tour 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.479
 says and fixed 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.479
 galicia is continuous 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 we look at him 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.709
 and according 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 current rate 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.009
 we have suffocated them 0 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.039
 in almost to the tail 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 let's make it clear that we're going to collapse 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.789
 2 at the same point 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.889
 you fix 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.889
 the board all at one point 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.859
 well in what patients 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 in the studio and the chad 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.409
 takes advantage of celtic is a little bit simpler 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.019
 or is it made us divide 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 says in four 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.799
 a bigger value 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.859
 they would quantify 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.849
 moss here now 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.849
 those of five sides 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 do not come up with polygons of four 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.719
 telecinco and the thing 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.719
 to not work very well 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.559
 that is alierta or you happened 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.559
 between the polygon when you believe it 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.999
 apply and continue 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.999
 i apply 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.909
 we select 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.219
 chance with the 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.740
 2 a value 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.740
 we modify 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.870
 let's go to another 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.999
 we select a vertex here 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.999
 the study is very similar 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.120
 central but 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120
 a height 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.460
 positive negative 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.129
 both islands 3 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.900
 study 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.150
 we have control if we want more narrow width what else does
