here see how tall it is and all these
flowers<00:00:23.470> up<00:00:23.680> on<00:00:23.860> top<00:00:24.190> guess<00:00:25.150> what<00:00:25.330> this<00:00:25.510> is<00:00:25.810> its

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
flowers up on top guess what this is its

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.160 
flowers up on top guess what this is its
celery<00:00:27.190> can<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:27.760> imagine<00:00:27.940> that<00:00:28.210> I'm<00:00:28.779> growing

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
celery can you imagine that I'm growing

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.400 
celery can you imagine that I'm growing
celery<00:00:29.800> but<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.369> let<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.850> go<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.090> seed<00:00:31.449> I<00:00:31.869> just

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
celery but I let it go to seed I just

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.770 
celery but I let it go to seed I just
wanted<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.710> see<00:00:32.949> how<00:00:33.160> tall<00:00:33.879> it<00:00:34.059> would<00:00:34.239> get<00:00:34.480> and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
wanted to see how tall it would get and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.080 
wanted to see how tall it would get and
where<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.110> seeds<00:00:35.410> would<00:00:35.710> be<00:00:35.920> they're<00:00:36.430> so<00:00:36.730> tiny

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
where the seeds would be they're so tiny

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.350 
where the seeds would be they're so tiny
and<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:38.800> right<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.220> here<00:00:39.519> here's<00:00:39.909> all<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
and look right in here here's all the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.850 
and look right in here here's all the
little<00:00:40.600> blossoms<00:00:41.110> they're<00:00:41.320> just<00:00:41.559> going<00:00:41.769> to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
little blossoms they're just going to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.660 
little blossoms they're just going to
see<00:00:42.159> now<00:00:42.430> but<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.989> takes<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.470> lot<00:00:44.739> of<00:00:44.769> time<00:00:45.220> for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
see now but it takes a lot of time for

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.060 
see now but it takes a lot of time for
the<00:00:45.790> growers<00:00:46.269> to<00:00:46.510> produce<00:00:46.930> seed<00:00:47.229> for<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.559> and

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
the growers to produce seed for you and

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.340 
the growers to produce seed for you and
that's<00:00:48.190> why<00:00:48.430> seeds<00:00:48.820> are<00:00:49.089> kind<00:00:49.629> of<00:00:49.750> expensive

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
that's why seeds are kind of expensive

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.130 
that's why seeds are kind of expensive
here's<00:00:51.159> another<00:00:51.489> one<00:00:51.699> right<00:00:51.729> next<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.299> it<00:00:52.420> this

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
here's another one right next to it this

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.320 
here's another one right next to it this
looks<00:00:53.680> entirely<00:00:54.190> different<00:00:54.370> look<00:00:55.000> at<00:00:55.150> the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
looks entirely different look at the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.359 
looks entirely different look at the
seed<00:00:56.049> stock<00:00:56.470> on<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:56.920> one<00:00:58.650> this<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.710> Swiss

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
seed stock on that one this is Swiss

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.299 
seed stock on that one this is Swiss
chard<00:01:00.820> yeah<00:01:01.690> usually<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.830> course<00:01:03.040> there's<00:01:03.250> a

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
chard yeah usually of course there's a

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.000 
chard yeah usually of course there's a
whole<00:01:03.489> bunch<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.940> stalks<00:01:04.299> but<00:01:05.080> when<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.830> goes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
whole bunch of stalks but when it goes

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.700 
whole bunch of stalks but when it goes
to<00:01:06.040> seed<00:01:06.490> just<00:01:06.820> one<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.270> them<00:01:07.420> takes<00:01:07.690> over<00:01:08.110> now

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
to seed just one of them takes over now

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.680 
to seed just one of them takes over now
look<00:01:08.920> at<00:01:09.070> all<00:01:09.250> these<00:01:09.430> different<00:01:09.729> blossoms<00:01:10.479> and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
look at all these different blossoms and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.719 
look at all these different blossoms and
seeds<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.260> here<00:01:11.290> isn't<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.130> interesting

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
seeds in here isn't that interesting

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.120 
seeds in here isn't that interesting
this<00:01:13.270> could<00:01:13.329> be<00:01:13.719> a<00:01:13.750> science<00:01:14.320> project<00:01:14.829> for<00:01:14.890> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
this could be a science project for the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.270 
this could be a science project for the
kids<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:16.450> thing<00:01:16.719> over<00:01:16.899> here<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.469> down<00:01:18.039> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
wanted you to see how different plants

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.880 
wanted you to see how different plants
go<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.770> seed<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.749> this<00:01:37.929> in<00:01:38.170> our<00:01:38.289> school

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
go to seed and we do this in our school

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.539 
go to seed and we do this in our school
program<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:40.689> when<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.289> ask<00:01:41.439> kids<00:01:41.799> well

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
program because when you ask kids well

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.870 
program because when you ask kids well
where<00:01:42.759> do<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:42.880> get<00:01:43.060> seeds<00:01:43.420> for<00:01:44.100> radish<00:01:45.100> huh

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
where do you get seeds for radish huh

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.389 
where do you get seeds for radish huh
well<00:01:46.749> I<00:01:47.020> they<00:01:47.799> don't<00:01:48.009> know<00:01:48.100> they're

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
well I they don't know they're

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.539 
well I they don't know they're
dumbfounded<00:01:49.240> yeah<00:01:49.929> obviously<00:01:50.229> if<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.280> look

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
dumbfounded yeah obviously if you look

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.940 
dumbfounded yeah obviously if you look
for<00:01:51.759> seeds<00:01:52.030> for<00:01:52.299> let's<00:01:52.600> say<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> potato<00:01:53.259> they're

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
for seeds for let's say a potato they're

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.059 
for seeds for let's say a potato they're
in<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.340> potato<00:01:54.729> itself<00:01:55.179> those<00:01:55.509> little<00:01:55.840> eyes

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
in the potato itself those little eyes

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.160 
in the potato itself those little eyes
sprout<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.310> that's<00:01:57.490> becomes<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.270> seed<00:01:58.569> but

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
sprout and that's becomes the seed but

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.800 
sprout and that's becomes the seed but
there's<00:01:59.409> so<00:01:59.619> many<00:01:59.770> plants<00:02:00.429> that<00:02:00.579> seeds<00:02:01.390> aren't

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
there's so many plants that seeds aren't

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.580 
there's so many plants that seeds aren't
obvious<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:03.159> don't<00:02:03.520> eat<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:04.329> seed<00:02:04.659> for

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
obvious and you don't eat the seed for

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.639 
obvious and you don't eat the seed for
example<00:02:06.039> lettuce<00:02:06.429> lettuce<00:02:07.329> also<00:02:08.020> send<00:02:08.530> a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
example lettuce lettuce also send a

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.620
