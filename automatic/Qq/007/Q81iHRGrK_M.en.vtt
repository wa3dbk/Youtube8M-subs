here<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.910> was<00:02:28.300> shocked<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.040> guess<00:02:30.280> those

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
here I was shocked and I guess those

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.880 
here I was shocked and I guess those
injections<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.960> guess<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.470> good<00:02:32.560> test

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
injections I guess a kind of a good test

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.060 
injections I guess a kind of a good test
are<00:02:33.360> completely<00:02:34.360> important<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.380> ideal<00:02:35.770> so
