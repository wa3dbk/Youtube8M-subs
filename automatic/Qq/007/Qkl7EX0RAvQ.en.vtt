00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.360
 was nominally the name and is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.880
 always my class of the day inside edition 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.890
 that the version of the day render the returned 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.020
 specifically for the platform of the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.420
 he spins in 12 of 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.449
 has a very simplified interface 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.180
 making the work much easier but not 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.019
 it is due to this simplification that he 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 will be less powerful beautiful continues 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:44.519
 using the good engines that tim 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.460
 studio uses logically have less 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.059
 features the studio but it does not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.830
 prevents you from producing excellent images 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 which compete today with the best 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.979
 market vendors the difference came 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.559
 pro studio that the studio can do 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:05.909
 absorb other platforms from 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.740
 modeling as marx realm 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.060
 the sketch itself will lock the mode between 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.009
 other right 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.490
 it has many more features to 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.500
 version study the day on sites that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.969
 as I said, it is more specific for the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.939
 but it will give a facility 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.250
 too large to produce images of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.859
 quality 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 who is starting now and does not give 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:36.979
 account that the lack of an appeal 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 another that exists in the studio version 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.890
 someone who works with a render 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.799
 with more advanced features 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.619
 will prefer to work with 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.109
 Studio version but today for a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.960
 universe of architecture or for the 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.950
 presentation of some projects and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.350
 products 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.530
 xi the beer forum is more than 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.270
 enough for you to produce I decided 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.770
 results sorry top line 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.509
 good for you to start work 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.019
 logically we need to do the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.319
 download and then what will you do 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.010
 you go on the trt page that is this 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.030
 From here you will see in the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.500
 plugins with life drugs any 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.310
 difference people you can not 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.430
 confuse the plugins of live plugins the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.890
 plugins are small files that will 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.370
 do for example sketchup 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.569
 you can export a file to be 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.970
 manipulated inside the shopping studio 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:50.140
 life plugin exists 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.540
 when we talk about a live on earth 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.860
 means that you are not just a 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 plugin is a rendering system 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.239
 So when you live for someone you 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.129
 will know that you will have added this 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.100
 a graphical interface you will have a 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.709
 rendering engines you will have 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.889
 all you need to produce a 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:18.850
 rendered image what is different from 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:22.120
 ok just lift you will come here and tab 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.810
 check here had no strength shop and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.850
 you will fall on this page here page 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.470
 that you will have some explanations to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.579
 respect what I force you to shock 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.810
 here explaining that does not have 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:43.900
 rendering was gto but this is being 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.980
 prepared for future versions some 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.269
 characteristics of it and for you to do 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.099
 a download from him you will click here 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.700
 you will stay as an option it will open until 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.440
 download line you will do the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.540
 latest version download 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.140
 It's not going to save here. 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.579
 a particular folder of your choice 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.530
 and then install the 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.569
 usually this version you will not 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.879
 stay because the mac version 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.489
 obviously you will only apply if you 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:20.690
 for use if you use connections 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.240
 made in salvation 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:30.830
 We're going to go to the skate shop itself. 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.410
 You will learn to start 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.099
 understand what the other is action and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.949
 start the work within the 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.660
 SketchUp platform down here you 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.410
 have some files you can do 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.699
 the English manual has not yet been downloaded 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.400
 has Portuguese 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.000
 some video tutorials that you can 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.949
 here are some libraries 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.639
 materials that these libraries 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:01.490
 legislation in skateboard format for 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.630
 you apply within the doctor at 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.000
 only render these libraries 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.560
 they are only available to users 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.659
 registered 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.580
 then so do you buy today that the 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:17.780
 your sketchup phone you do 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.000
 only record of them will have a liberal 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.729
 and from there you can make a 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.650
 download these libraries are 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.280
 materials of high quality that 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.470
 They will help you a lot to finalize your 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.250
 your files more quickly and with 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.010
 she's the quality, but now we're going 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.180
 For the next class, where we 're going to be. 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.780
 with the library with the club installed and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.949
 Let's start to unravel its mysteries. 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.949
 because see you later
