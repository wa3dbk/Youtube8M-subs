00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.180
 Hello, you are watching the program 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.490
 impossible missions in which we 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.740
 perform the task you sent you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 hear the voice bude to mounts it all 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.869
 the fleet of mountains we begin we have three 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.669
 simple rules 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.579
 having completed your combat mission 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.439
 can get us issue 1 task 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.750
 must be specified for a specific tank 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.090
 the second task cannot contain 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.309
 any unstable values third 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 the task should not have to itself impracticable 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 goals today's task sent us 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.149
 Alexey blogs we need to put 2500 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.429
 damage on lorraine 40t while changing 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.670
 control buttons in the swap to 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:58.980
 d from change to a and change to b and d 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 change on with I will remind you something calorie 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 for those who forgot at the ninth level we 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.300
 300 damage with a break of 232 per drum 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.900
 on average we do 800 thousand damage and 6 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.150
 shells 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 total recharge is 40 seconds 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.259
 scatter 036 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 and a time of 2 and 9 seconds is also we 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.549
 we have excellent dynamics to gst specific 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.590
 power 25 horsepower per ton 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.810
 and the maximum speed of 60 kilometers in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 an hour now when we know tth tank 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.780
 you can start the demonstration of execution 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.820
 combat mission 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.340
 But it turned out to be done on the map NSC 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 in standard start mode 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.860
 my coauthor went to the squared position 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.030
 d 4 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.579
 where wonderful comes from 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 backache for the whole fourth line but all 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.539
 not as smooth as I would like instead 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 In order to become and shoot we immediately 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.369
 put off and cake on 420 and then another 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.659
 and get confused own keys that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.950
 when doing this base 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 is the main factor 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.800
 if you have been playing a player for a long time 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.870
 with such control settings then 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 get used to them the difficulty would not be but 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.610
 agree who will do it 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.410
 if you already have the usual settings 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.720
 what happens in the midst of the battle curious 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.490
 moments where you want to go in the rear kill 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.190
 but actually rolling out three 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.470
 trunk and die of course it happens that so 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.490
 play without changing control but about 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.490
 these people are not today 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.320
 lazy gur filled treasured 2500 damage and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.210
 even a little more but at what cost for 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.400
 start he hit all the walls along the way 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.010
 then almost died a volley entangled in 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 buttons a bit of hit after 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.820
 why discharge the drum died with 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.470
 unique super invented by us 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.780
 subjectively the system of estimation of tasks 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.310
 sent by you we set this task 9 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.990
 10 difficulty points 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.970
 for becoming entangled in the notes with such 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.010
 the scenario is very easy proof 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.740
 runtime you will find in the description on this 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.410
 everything dictated will be chopped phase mountains 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.030
 showed here is a business to all the luck and do not let 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.370
 you god get into one fight with us 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.370
 the execution of combat missions before meeting
