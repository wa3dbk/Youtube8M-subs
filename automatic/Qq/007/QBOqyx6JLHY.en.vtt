and<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:52.339> used<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.550> second<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:56.690> like<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and I used the second you know like to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:12.590 
and I used the second you know like to
zoom<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.280> i<00:00:59.370> press<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.730> button

you<00:01:49.729> are<00:01:49.760> having<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.799> sensor<00:01:51.799> bar<00:01:52.009> with<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
you are having this sensor bar with the

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.510 
you are having this sensor bar with the
LEDs<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.060> pamper<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.799> same<00:01:55.009> sensor<00:01:55.340> bar

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
LEDs and pamper it's the same sensor bar

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.230 
LEDs and pamper it's the same sensor bar
that<00:01:55.700> comes<00:01:56.060> with<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> week<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.520> it's<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.759> real

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
that comes with a week and it's a real

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.190 
that comes with a week and it's a real
low<00:01:59.720> tech<00:02:00.399> program<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:02.210> sensor<00:02:02.570> bar<00:02:02.690> Omega

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
low tech program the sensor bar Omega

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.999 
low tech program the sensor bar Omega
qualities<00:02:03.950> two<00:02:04.790> on<00:02:04.940> each<00:02:05.030> side<00:02:05.619> infrared<00:02:06.619> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
qualities two on each side infrared and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:23.580 
qualities two on each side infrared and
the<00:02:09.160> mimo<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:14.239> going<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.780> sleep<00:02:18.400> sleeping<00:02:19.400> over

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:32.520 

you<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.800> these<00:02:25.010> actual<00:02:25.610> led<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.330> go<00:02:30.880> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
you have these actual led to go and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.670 
you have these actual led to go and
there's<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.709> sensor<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:35.650> recognize<00:02:36.650> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
there's a sensor that recognize a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.500 
there's a sensor that recognize a
supposition<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.819> remote<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:40.000> two<00:02:41.000> values

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
supposition of the remote and two values

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.020 
supposition of the remote and two values
so<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.800> know<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.400> mouse<00:02:43.670> all

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
so you can like you know as a mouse all

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.780 
so you can like you know as a mouse all

connection<00:04:32.750> point<00:04:33.140> uh-huh<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:34.100> can<00:04:34.370> connect

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
connection point uh-huh you can connect

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.260 
connection point uh-huh you can connect
to<00:04:34.880> different<00:04:35.290> stuff<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.620> if<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.890> like<00:04:37.300> and

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
to different stuff and if you like and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.330 
to different stuff and if you like and
maybe<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.420> can<00:04:41.720> can<00:04:42.200> give<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.130> some

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
maybe I can can give you some

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.280 
maybe I can can give you some
introduction<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:44.390> because<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.140> is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
introduction to it but because it is

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.380 
introduction to it but because it is
more<00:04:45.680> complicated<00:04:46.040> than<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.580> with<00:04:47.120> some

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
more complicated than that with some

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.440 
more complicated than that with some
some<00:04:47.900> more<00:04:48.080> easy<00:04:48.410> stuff<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.820> show<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.030> how<00:04:50.330> it

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
some more easy stuff to show you how it

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.490 
some more easy stuff to show you how it
works<00:04:51.520> yeah<00:04:52.520> I'm<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.600> knit<00:04:53.930> neck<00:04:54.290> with

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
works yeah I'm going to knit neck with

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.170 
works yeah I'm going to knit neck with
people<00:04:55.010> have<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.400> session<00:04:56.590> with<00:04:57.590> them

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
people have a session with them

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.670 
people have a session with them
good

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.450 

no<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:06.979> a<00:05:07.629> graphical<00:05:08.629> user<00:05:09.460> program

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
no it's a graphical user program

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.489 
no it's a graphical user program
graphical<00:05:11.090> programming<00:05:11.449> language<00:05:11.870> they<00:05:12.319> call

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:12.499 
graphical programming language they call

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.499 
graphical programming language they call
it<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.979> this<00:05:13.189> is<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.520> program<00:05:13.939> i<00:05:14.090> used<00:05:14.270> to

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
it and this is the program i used to

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.439 
it and this is the program i used to
read<00:05:14.719> out<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.990> data<00:05:15.139> from<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.860> me<00:05:16.550> notes<00:05:16.789> it's

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
read out the data from the me notes it's

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.659 
read out the data from the me notes it's
called<00:05:17.689> love<00:05:17.930> pan<00:05:18.199> and<00:05:18.919> it<00:05:19.039> looks<00:05:19.219> more<00:05:19.460> like

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
called love pan and it looks more like

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.730 
called love pan and it looks more like
our<00:05:20.389> in<00:05:20.689> with<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> same<00:05:21.409> routine<00:05:23.439> but<00:05:24.439> it<00:05:24.590> only

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
our in with the same routine but it only

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.950 
our in with the same routine but it only
sends<00:05:25.129> the<00:05:25.310> data<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.639> me<00:05:25.939> that<00:05:26.810> other

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
sends the data to me that other

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.410 
sends the data to me that other
programming

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.450 

it's<00:05:34.420> very<00:05:34.960> good<00:05:35.170> so<00:05:36.130> next<00:05:36.790> you
