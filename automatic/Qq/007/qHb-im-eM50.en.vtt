minutes<00:05:19.010> now<00:05:19.760> we're<00:05:19.910> gonna<00:05:20.030> set<00:05:20.240> our<00:05:20.360> weight

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
minutes now we're gonna set our weight

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.420 
minutes now we're gonna set our weight
on<00:05:20.780> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
on it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.240 
on it
once<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:22.810> jiggles<00:05:23.810> we're<00:05:24.680> gonna<00:05:24.770> start<00:05:25.130> our

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
once this jiggles we're gonna start our

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.090 
once this jiggles we're gonna start our
timing<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:25.910> we<00:05:26.150> are<00:05:26.270> going<00:05:26.479> to<00:05:26.570> process<00:05:27.100> these

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
timing and we are going to process these

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.180 
timing and we are going to process these
for<00:05:28.760> 1<00:05:29.060> hour<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.510> 15<00:05:29.930> minutes<00:05:30.320> that's<00:05:30.590> 75

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
for 1 hour and 15 minutes that's 75

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.909 
for 1 hour and 15 minutes that's 75
minutes<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:32.570> if<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.900> was<00:05:33.020> quarts<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.650> would<00:05:33.770> be

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
minutes and if it was quarts it would be

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.980 
minutes and if it was quarts it would be
90<00:05:34.370> if<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.760> were<00:05:34.880> doing<00:05:35.000> half<00:05:35.330> pints<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.870> would

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
90 if you were doing half pints it would

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.890 
90 if you were doing half pints it would
still<00:05:36.290> be<00:05:36.320> 75<00:05:37.010> minutes<00:05:37.430> if<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.600> live<00:05:38.870> a

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
still be 75 minutes if you live a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.230 
still be 75 minutes if you live a

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
thousand feet above sea level you would

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.960 
thousand feet above sea level you would
put<00:05:41.510> or<00:05:41.750> more<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:42.440> would<00:05:42.770> process<00:05:43.220> these<00:05:43.760> with

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
put or more you would process these with

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.050 
put or more you would process these with
a<00:05:44.000> 15<00:05:44.570> pound<00:05:44.900> weight<00:05:45.340> okay<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:46.400> once<00:05:46.880> this

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
a 15 pound weight okay so once this

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.760 
a 15 pound weight okay so once this
starts<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.479> jiggle<00:05:47.870> vigorously<00:05:48.380> we'll<00:05:48.650> be

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
starts to jiggle vigorously we'll be

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.350 
starts to jiggle vigorously we'll be
back<00:05:48.950> right<00:05:51.130> now<00:05:52.130> I'm<00:05:52.250> gonna<00:05:52.400> turn<00:05:52.640> my<00:05:52.880> canner
