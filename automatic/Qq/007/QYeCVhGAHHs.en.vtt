welcome to PC which gets tech talk today

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.170 
welcome to PC which gets tech talk today
we're<00:00:14.520> looking<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.120> tip<00:00:15.930> here<00:00:16.410> on

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
we're looking at a tip here on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.390 
we're looking at a tip here on
overclocking<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.480> ATI<00:00:18.960> Radeon<00:00:19.130> video<00:00:20.130> card

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
overclocking your ATI Radeon video card

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.070 
overclocking your ATI Radeon video card
now<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> most<00:00:21.480> common<00:00:21.779> thing<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.960> people

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
now the most common thing that people

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.740 
now the most common thing that people
use<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> ATI<00:00:23.189> overdrive<00:00:23.880> utility<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.630> when

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
use is the ATI overdrive utility so when

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.290 
use is the ATI overdrive utility so when
you<00:00:24.840> download<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> ATI<00:00:25.790> catalyst<00:00:26.790> drivers

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you download the ATI catalyst drivers

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210 
you download the ATI catalyst drivers
under<00:00:27.960> graphics<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.860> go<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.130> way

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
under graphics here you go all the way

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
under graphics here you go all the way
to<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> bottom<00:00:29.610> ATI<00:00:30.180> overdrive<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.990> there<00:00:31.199> now

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to the bottom ATI overdrive is there now

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.619 
to the bottom ATI overdrive is there now
many<00:00:31.830> people<00:00:32.129> just<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.760> because<00:00:33.330> it

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
many people just use that because it

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.720 
many people just use that because it
comes<00:00:33.840> built-in<00:00:34.379> after<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.129> unlock<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.699> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
comes built-in after you unlock it and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
comes built-in after you unlock it and
you<00:00:35.940> enable<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.420> ATI<00:00:36.720> overdrive<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.650> auto

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you enable the ATI overdrive to auto

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
you enable the ATI overdrive to auto
tune<00:00:38.400> it<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> auto<00:00:39.300> tune<00:00:39.629> takes<00:00:39.930> care<00:00:40.199> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
tune it so the auto tune takes care of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.890 
tune it so the auto tune takes care of
everything<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.949> and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.730> basically

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
everything for you and it basically

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.319 
everything for you and it basically
adjusts<00:00:42.900> these<00:00:43.379> sliders<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.790> appropriate

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
adjusts these sliders to the appropriate

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.830 
adjusts these sliders to the appropriate
values<00:00:45.720> that<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> believes<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.149> stable<00:00:48.149> okay

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
values that it believes is stable okay

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
values that it believes is stable okay
and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.380> after<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.430> decided<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and then after that if you decided you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.840 
and then after that if you decided you
wanted<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.690> tweak<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> yourself<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.579> can

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
wanted to tweak that yourself you can

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.229 
wanted to tweak that yourself you can
actually<00:00:54.380> manually<00:00:55.380> slide<00:00:56.040> those<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> set

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
actually manually slide those and set

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.190 
actually manually slide those and set
the<00:00:57.719> timings<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.860> clock<00:00:59.250> speeds<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.200> test

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
the timings the clock speeds and test

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.020 
the timings the clock speeds and test
the<00:01:01.350> custom<00:01:01.739> clocks<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> course<00:01:02.460> make<00:01:02.790> sure

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the custom clocks of course make sure

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
the custom clocks of course make sure
that<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> temperatures<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:05.039> low<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that the temperatures are as low as

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
that the temperatures are as low as
possible<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:06.030> course<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.570> increasing<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.310> fan

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
possible of course by increasing the fan

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
possible of course by increasing the fan
speed<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.149> way<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.630> try<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.899> keep

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
speed so that way you can try to keep

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
speed so that way you can try to keep
things<00:01:10.289> cooler<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.820> overclock<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.810> that's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
things cooler as you overclock so that's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.650 
things cooler as you overclock so that's
a<00:01:13.140> must<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.649> then<00:01:14.190> of<00:01:14.369> course<00:01:14.399> after<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.479> do

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
a must and then of course after you do

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.080 
a must and then of course after you do
the<00:01:15.899> testing<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.250> tell<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.910> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the testing it will tell you if it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
the testing it will tell you if it
passed<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> accept<00:01:19.200> those<00:01:19.440> values

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
passed and you can accept those values

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
passed and you can accept those values
that<00:01:20.069> you've<00:01:20.220> set<00:01:20.580> okay<00:01:21.179> so<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.690> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that you've set okay so that's one of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.469 
that you've set okay so that's one of
the<00:01:21.869> simplest<00:01:22.229> ways<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.679> I've<00:01:23.479> overclocked

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the simplest ways that I've overclocked

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
the simplest ways that I've overclocked
in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> past<00:01:25.020> okay<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.770> sometimes<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:26.459> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
in the past okay and sometimes I use it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
in the past okay and sometimes I use it
and<00:01:26.819> sometimes<00:01:27.569> I<00:01:27.690> don't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and sometimes I don't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
and sometimes I don't
the<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.890> overclock<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.849> msi

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the other way to overclock is the msi

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.559 
the other way to overclock is the msi
afterburner<00:01:30.920> utility<00:01:31.920> okay<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.149> msi

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
afterburner utility okay and the msi

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.540 
afterburner utility okay and the msi
afterburner<00:01:33.750> utility<00:01:34.709> works<00:01:35.160> for<00:01:35.399> both

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
afterburner utility works for both

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.210 
afterburner utility works for both
Nvidia<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.330> ATI<00:01:36.599> cards<00:01:37.229> we'll<00:01:37.950> talk<00:01:38.099> about

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
Nvidia and ATI cards we'll talk about

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
Nvidia and ATI cards we'll talk about
Nvidia<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.000> another<00:01:39.420> video<00:01:39.750> review<00:01:39.929> okay<00:01:40.709> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
Nvidia in another video review okay so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.430 
Nvidia in another video review okay so
in<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.179> one<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.690> we're<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.869> reviewing

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
in this one here we're just reviewing

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.520 
in this one here we're just reviewing
how<00:01:44.099> I<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.940> adjust<00:01:45.630> manually<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
how I would just adjust manually the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.529 
how I would just adjust manually the
core<00:01:46.740> clock<00:01:47.039> not<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.789> shader<00:01:48.030> because

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
core clock not the shader because

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.359 
core clock not the shader because
doesn't<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.200> option<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.039> memory

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
doesn't have that option and the memory

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
doesn't have that option and the memory
clock<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:51.179> an<00:01:51.240> ATI<00:01:51.660> card<00:01:52.110> okay<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.800> thing<00:01:53.039> as

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
clock for an ATI card okay same thing as

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
clock for an ATI card okay same thing as
in<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> ATI<00:01:54.360> overdrive<00:01:54.869> utility<00:01:55.319> very

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
in the ATI overdrive utility very

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
in the ATI overdrive utility very
similar<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.069> allows<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.209> set<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
similar it allows you to also set the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770 
similar it allows you to also set the
fan<00:01:57.989> speed<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.849> then<00:01:59.849> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.119> apply<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
fan speed and then you can apply it and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.370 
fan speed and then you can apply it and
save<00:02:01.590> your<00:02:02.399> settings<00:02:02.849> in<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> profile<00:02:03.569> that<00:02:03.899> can

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
save your settings in a profile that can

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
save your settings in a profile that can
be<00:02:04.530> applied<00:02:04.830> when<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> system<00:02:05.759> boots<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.149> okay

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
be applied when the system boots up okay

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
be applied when the system boots up okay
but<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.289> can't<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.709> both<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.190> can't<00:02:08.399> use<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
but you can't use both you can't use the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
but you can't use both you can't use the
msi<00:02:09.090> afterburner

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
msi afterburner

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.339 
msi afterburner
and<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.979> ATA<00:02:11.750> overclocking<00:02:12.750> utility<00:02:12.780> there

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
and the ATA overclocking utility there

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.740 
and the ATA overclocking utility there
will<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.590> conflict<00:02:14.160> between<00:02:14.280> both<00:02:14.750> same

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
will be a conflict between both same

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.530 
will be a conflict between both same
thing<00:02:15.959> here<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.800> an<00:02:17.010> AMD<00:02:17.340> GPU<00:02:17.940> clock<00:02:18.239> tool

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
thing here there's an AMD GPU clock tool

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.640 
thing here there's an AMD GPU clock tool
and<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.349> one<00:02:19.560> allows<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.099> also<00:02:20.400> set<00:02:20.909> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and that one allows you to also set the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.270 
and that one allows you to also set the
yeah<00:02:21.769> GPU<00:02:22.579> core<00:02:23.299> clock<00:02:23.599> so<00:02:23.930> 965<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:24.920> what<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.069> had

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
yeah GPU core clock so 965 is what I had

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.179 
yeah GPU core clock so 965 is what I had
it<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:26.569> memory<00:02:26.870> clock<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.769> set<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
it and the memory clock you can set the

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.679 
it and the memory clock you can set the
clocks<00:02:28.459> they're<00:02:28.790> very<00:02:29.420> simple

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
clocks they're very simple

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.569 
clocks they're very simple
straightforward<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:30.860> additional<00:02:31.310> feature

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
straightforward the additional feature

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.170 
straightforward the additional feature
that<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.030> has<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:33.079> also<00:02:34.060> restore<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
that it has is to also restore the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.479 
that it has is to also restore the
default<00:02:35.299> clocks<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.110> increase<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.950> voltages

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
default clocks and increase the voltages

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.240 
default clocks and increase the voltages
okay<00:02:37.909> not<00:02:38.299> always<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.140> all<00:02:39.349> utilities<00:02:40.010> have

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
okay not always do all utilities have

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.490 
okay not always do all utilities have
the<00:02:40.430> option<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.000> set<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.390> voltage<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.200> one

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the option to set the voltage this one

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.940 
the option to set the voltage this one
does<00:02:42.859> and<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.730> use<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.859> increasing<00:02:45.859> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
does and I use that for increasing the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.099 
does and I use that for increasing the
voltage<00:02:46.099> from<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.700> default<00:02:47.120> okay<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:47.989> I'm

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
voltage from the default okay when I'm

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.149 
voltage from the default okay when I'm
overclocking<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.870> again<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.470> can't<00:02:51.829> use

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
overclocking and again you can't use

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.099 
overclocking and again you can't use
that<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:53.870> with<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.709> ati<00:02:55.780> catalyst<00:02:56.780> drivers

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
that also with the ati catalyst drivers

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.300 
that also with the ati catalyst drivers
because<00:02:57.409> there's<00:02:57.560> going<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.739> be<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.920> conflict

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
because there's going to be a conflict

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.309 
because there's going to be a conflict
if<00:02:58.579> you<00:02:58.730> adjust<00:02:59.359> things<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.720> one<00:02:59.870> place<00:03:00.109> and

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
if you adjust things in one place and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.750 
if you adjust things in one place and
then<00:03:00.409> go<00:03:00.620> back<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.010> adjust<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.519> another

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
then go back and adjust it in another

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
then go back and adjust it in another
tool<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.389> might<00:03:02.780> reset<00:03:03.200> things<00:03:03.379> right<00:03:03.769> or

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
tool it might reset things right or

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.800 
tool it might reset things right or
change<00:03:04.159> things<00:03:04.400> around<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:04.819> pick<00:03:05.389> your<00:03:05.420> tools

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
change things around so pick your tools

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.089 
change things around so pick your tools
usually<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:07.849> use<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> ATI<00:03:08.769> Control<00:03:09.769> Center

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
usually you use the ATI Control Center

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.030 
usually you use the ATI Control Center
by<00:03:10.220> itself<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:11.319> if<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.500> wanted<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.769> use<00:03:12.920> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
by itself and if you wanted to use the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.170 
by itself and if you wanted to use the
MSI<00:03:13.459> Afterburner

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
MSI Afterburner

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.460 
MSI Afterburner
and<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:15.230> ATI<00:03:16.480> GPU<00:03:17.480> clock<00:03:17.780> tool<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.319> use

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
and the ATI GPU clock tool you can use

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.140 
and the ATI GPU clock tool you can use
those<00:03:18.650> two<00:03:18.859> together<00:03:19.189> those<00:03:19.430> two<00:03:19.609> work<00:03:19.819> fine

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
those two together those two work fine

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.860 
those two together those two work fine
okay

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
okay

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.360 
okay
