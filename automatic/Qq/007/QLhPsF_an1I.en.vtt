00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:21.620
 [Music] 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.870
 Hello Mr. Dennis Today we show you 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.480
 how was a power commander at one 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.470
 bmw k 1200 resp 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:37.070
 1300 s thus deposit as the first remote 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:39.440
 the bench next removes her 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.570
 The battery cover triggers these two 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.809
 unscrew and remove the cover 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.809
 Rome 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.900
 then you remove the left and right of the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.420
 both screws and removed on both 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.500
 pages directly next her away 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.040
 on both sides 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 the three screws and left 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.840
 and on the right the tank cover in which you see the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:18.080
 whole panel a little to the rear 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:20.450
 pulls and outlook otherwise it is funny 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.960
 here the two screws raises the tank 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.929
 something pulls him backwards for something 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.289
 to create space between tank and 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.490
 batteries 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.050
 so you are here between the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.270
 plug connection and fuel lines 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.500
 can remove the tank as next 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.500
 Step away into the tank 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.140
 Next, remove the seven 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.899
 cladding screws each left and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.759
 on the right, pay attention to a screw 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:07.740
 is next from the inside 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.880
 step away from her left and right 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.610
 suck in the two 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.640
 for that, the two fuses would have 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.040
 Remove and the intake manifold to the side 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.780
 pull out 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 then removed the batteries please 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 pay attention to the polo first 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.690
 then unscrew the plus pole as 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.360
 Next you remove the bracket of the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.870
 erms two screws left and right am 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.630
 holder two an airbox one 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.850
 Remove cable ties and a relay 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.940
 from cliffs and then you can the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.709
 Remove holder even contents of the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 Airbox has removed then we can 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.260
 make the airbox remove for it 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.780
 you have to first several hoses and 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.519
 Remove plug from the airbox has 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.650
 the airbox two screws up here 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.269
 left and right and the prying open as on 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.609
 the throttle parts go on it 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.989
 1000 special on it 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.790
 we need such a pair of pliers 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.269
 if we do not have such a pliers at hand 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.329
 you can do it with others 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.350
 Workshop usual means open the 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.120
 is not the problem 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.609
 but you will most likely 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.829
 these do not shut up again 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.239
 can and should be normal 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.019
 dodge a dodge so if you all 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.459
 hose connection and plug connection 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.739
 solved we can shape the airbox 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.019
 trim down we pull back in 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.220
 corner is still a 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.519
 Drainage smart to simply with 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.250
 pull through and remove the airbox 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.750
 if you have the airbox removed then 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.150
 you attach the pokÃ©mon 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.220
 in the vehicle rear and moved the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.320
 Wiring harness of the barker on the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:03.930
 Right side of the vehicle to the front 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:05.880
 films unfolded to access the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.730
 there are to get injectors 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.880
 several options either solved the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.120
 lower stand and removed that works 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.180
 Share or you remove the above here 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.709
 four simple screws and cable ties 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.650
 removed only the fuel rail 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.930
 including injectors if you have the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.710
 Please make sure that also the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.720
 earrings before the opposition proceedings 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.090
 in the digital plug of the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.220
 you have removed injectors 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.860
 the wiring harness of the power commander 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.810
 connect with the fuel injectors and 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.600
 with the original wire harness of the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.950
 vehicle based on the cable length can 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
 you realize that works out of you 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.200
 right to left before worry on the basis of 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.910
 kabel thinks it only fits one of the three 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.470
 Pin is for the 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.100
 Throttles quote as you on this 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:02.150
 side is the long black cable 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.410
 evil angel gets misplaced and is up 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.840
 so the connection success and 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.940
 reverse order 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.700
 should you intend to vote whether 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.160
 to make a test stone or if you 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.830
 drive a car to the module then wants 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.080
 you have to air the pipe of the secondary air 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.760
 mechanically close any systems 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.510
 wrong goes to the exhaust tract 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.600
 bring so you have but before he 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.550
 Reinstall the tank for the tank 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.270
 The lamp sun locate the plug 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 is in front of the abs blog needs 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.950
 be pulled apart and stay 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.900
 even so the lambda sensor can if 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.320
 Desired from the exhaust dismantled 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.060
 become 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.490
 she is no longer needed that was 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.860
 again if you your soon a 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.539
 please do like to get to the point 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.189
 look for a tuning center in yours 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.870
 Close and let a right vote 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.020
 to take the test bench just like that 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.400
 could get the optimum out of it 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.629
 small tip if you have problems with 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.199
 Constantly sparkling fuel e10 or super 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.520
 plus 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.370
 so that have the best results 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.439
 scored if you liked the video 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.939
 were thumbs up and very happy if 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.560
 Her suggestions have notes 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.449
 Write below in the comments 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.139
 and see you next time 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.139
 tennis 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:29.460
