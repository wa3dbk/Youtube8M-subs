00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
off but I wouldn't recommend doing that

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.319 
off but I wouldn't recommend doing that
the<00:02:27.010> actual<00:02:27.400> design<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.909> course<00:02:28.150> is

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
the actual design of the course is

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.020 
the actual design of the course is
pretty<00:02:28.569> simple<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.349> still<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> fun<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:30.220> some

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
pretty simple but still a fun time some

may<00:02:31.180> find<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> layout<00:02:31.750> kind<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.079> boring

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
may find the layout kind of boring

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.869 
may find the layout kind of boring
though<00:02:32.530> there's<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.099> too<00:02:33.250> much<00:02:33.370> variety<00:02:33.579> in

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
though there's not too much variety in

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.729 
though there's not too much variety in
terms<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.390> gameplay<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:35.140> end<00:02:35.319> has<00:02:35.439> a<00:02:35.470> huge

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
terms of the gameplay the end has a huge

terms of the gameplay the end has a huge
gliding<00:02:36.129> section<00:02:36.459> which<00:02:36.609> is<00:02:36.730> cool<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.329> that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
gliding section which is cool but that's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.149 
gliding section which is cool but that's
about<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.049> terms<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.439> the<00:02:38.530> layout<00:02:38.799> the

about it in terms of the layout the
music<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.609> really<00:02:39.760> nostalgic<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:40.510> me<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
music is really nostalgic for me so I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.020 
music is really nostalgic for me so I

love it it makes you really excited and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.250 
love it it makes you really excited and
ready<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.329> move<00:02:43.510> forward<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.109> race

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
ready to move forward with the race

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.319 
ready to move forward with the race
about<00:02:44.890> halfway<00:02:45.129> through<00:02:45.310> there's<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> ramp

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
about halfway through there's a ramp

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.879 
about halfway through there's a ramp
where<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.629> can<00:02:46.750> take<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> quick<00:02:47.170> shortcut<00:02:47.620> it

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
where you can take a quick shortcut it

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.470 
where you can take a quick shortcut it
does<00:02:48.129> require<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.489> mushroom<00:02:48.940> though<00:02:49.090> there's<00:02:49.420> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
does require a mushroom though there's a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.599 
does require a mushroom though there's a
lot<00:02:49.659> of<00:02:49.780> grassy<00:02:50.200> areas<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.769> not<00:02:50.889> so<00:02:51.099> much<00:02:51.250> road

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
lot of grassy areas and not so much road

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.550 
lot of grassy areas and not so much road
so<00:02:52.030> avoiding<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.480> grass<00:02:52.659> can<00:02:52.959> be<00:02:52.989> tricky<00:02:53.470> if

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
so avoiding the grass can be tricky if

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.860 
so avoiding the grass can be tricky if
there's<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.799> lot<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.579> once<00:02:54.819> this<00:02:55.540> also

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
there's a lot going on at once this also

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.479 
there's a lot going on at once this also
leads<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> plenty<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.709> opportunities<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.340> use

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
leads the plenty of opportunities to use

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.009 
leads the plenty of opportunities to use
a<00:02:57.609> mushroom<00:02:58.030> across<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> grass<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.900> catch

a mushroom across the grass that catch
