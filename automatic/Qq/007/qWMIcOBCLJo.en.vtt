00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.560
 hello hello dear friends in this 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.570
 I will tell you a video about such a folding 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.950
 such from the clamp for mobile 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.440
 phone yes here it is assembled such 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.850
 fog arrow 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.200
 but small and comfortable 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:33.370
 17 centimeters long 18 wide 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.250
 specially made so small 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 any bag in the forest could be convenient 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 take two let's go over 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 constructions 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.940
 so here he just understands and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 turns into such a crane 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:10.630
 with the help of a hot lamb fixed 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:19.149
 any position is selected also 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 clamps to finds and fastens clamps 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:29.170
 up to make plywood of course not very 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:33.060
 OK, but in principle for this body 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.819
 come down I think change to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 pull out of aluminum leave or 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:46.210
 at least it will be safer until 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.380
 This piece is tired I do not have so 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.670
 well let's start with clamp clamps 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.480
 q sawed in shape and made vastochka 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 metal 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.220
 that this bolt went here and here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:12.570
 drilled a hole stood ordinary guests 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:17.450
 and for ivy everything is very simple 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:24.770
 here is a wing nut it folds 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:34.550
 completely 360 does not go 360 somewhere 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:41.150
 a little less missing so here 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:45.410
 also took a bolt drilled a hole 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.450
 here threaded here also 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.820
 drilled a hole 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 a gap appeared bent hammered a piece of wood 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.060
 so it was not necessary here either with a key 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.680
 hold it with your hand that is just 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.030
 loosen the nut lamb all but 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:08.180
 delay here by the same principle 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:11.180
 I took plywood as a base 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 centimeter 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.110
 so well, and here is the most interesting 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.500
 attached mobile phone between public 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.530
 platelets if my mobile 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.530
 phone 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:37.110
 so he is a big shovel just here on 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:42.980
 this all you we put there 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:46.739
 keyhole cut so that the phone gets up and 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.260
 no problem, that is to say 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.130
 it can still be like this 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.130
 turn over 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:03.220
 But in general, that's all so tricky 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:09.170
 let's adjust now let's see how he 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:16.239
 the action is so well that's all set secured 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:21.049
 we are our device for shooting water overall plan 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:26.620
 It looks like a crane q clamps 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.780
 pulled everything can be adjusted 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:38.630
 so one hand is not very convenient for me 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:44.710
 will now he fall a cube in general 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.710
 we leave here the position we need 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.650
 we fix 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.270
 Here is such a device Thank you for your attention 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.310
 subscribe to the channel put big 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.310
 thumbs up bye
