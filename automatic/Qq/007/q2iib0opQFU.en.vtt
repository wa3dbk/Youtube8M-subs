touchscreen now every dealer is ordering
it<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:09.780> let's<00:00:10.320> talk<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.800> features<00:00:10.950> of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it so let's talk about the features of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
it so let's talk about the features of
this<00:00:11.550> touch<00:00:11.730> screen<00:00:12.290> the<00:00:13.290> screen<00:00:13.440> activates

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
this touch screen the screen activates

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.990 
this touch screen the screen activates
as<00:00:14.280> soon<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> ignition<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.210> turned<00:00:15.240> on

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.310 

there<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.090> four<00:00:21.240> speed<00:00:21.539> control<00:00:21.900> functions

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
there are four speed control functions

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
there are four speed control functions
the<00:00:22.590> first<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.130> cruise<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the first of which is cruise it's the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.880 
the first of which is cruise it's the
first<00:00:24.720> button<00:00:25.050> next<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> home<00:00:25.650> button

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
first button next to the home button

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.029 
first button next to the home button
press<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.150> press<00:00:27.390> set<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.960> prompt<00:00:28.830> ask

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
press it then press set a prompt ask

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.320 
press it then press set a prompt ask
that<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> throttle<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> moved<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> way

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that the throttle be moved all the way

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
that the throttle be moved all the way
forward<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> ECU<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.830> engine<00:00:32.250> control

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
forward and the ECU or engine control

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420 
forward and the ECU or engine control
unit<00:00:32.579> keeps<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> RPMs<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> set<00:00:34.230> level<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
unit keeps the RPMs in a set level the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.530 
unit keeps the RPMs in a set level the
up/down<00:00:35.730> arrows<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.120> used<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> make

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
up/down arrows are used to make

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.139 
up/down arrows are used to make
incremental<00:00:37.050> adjustments

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
incremental adjustments

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
incremental adjustments
the<00:00:39.149> second<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> ski<00:00:39.870> mode<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.860> permits

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the second is ski mode this permits

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
the second is ski mode this permits
choosing<00:00:41.579> between<00:00:41.670> five<00:00:42.149> pre-programmed

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
choosing between five pre-programmed

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.740 
choosing between five pre-programmed
launches<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:44.040> example<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.850> chose<00:00:45.120> launch<00:00:45.450> 2

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
launches for example if I chose launch 2

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
launches for example if I chose launch 2
then<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.500> set<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:46.800> target<00:00:47.039> speed<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.550> half

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
then I can set my target speed in half

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.299 
then I can set my target speed in half
mile<00:00:47.940> per<00:00:48.090> hour<00:00:48.149> increments<00:00:48.770> hit<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
mile per hour increments hit set and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
mile per hour increments hit set and
again<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> system<00:00:50.910> calls<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> throttles

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
again the system calls for the throttles

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
again the system calls for the throttles
to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.110> advanced<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> stops<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.969> ECU<00:00:54.300> will

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to be advanced to the stops the ECU will

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.119 
to be advanced to the stops the ECU will
want<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> RPMs<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> blend<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
want the RPMs up and blend it into the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.360 
want the RPMs up and blend it into the
target<00:00:56.399> speed<00:00:56.960> once<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> GPS<00:00:58.739> base<00:00:59.010> speed

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
target speed once at that GPS base speed

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
target speed once at that GPS base speed
we<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.879> still<00:01:00.090> toggle<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> fine

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
we can still toggle up and down to fine

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
we can still toggle up and down to fine

throw produces 40 percent of the power

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
throw produces 40 percent of the power
this<00:01:34.710> gives<00:01:34.920> much<00:01:35.220> better<00:01:35.250> control<00:01:35.790> around

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this gives much better control around

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.340 
this gives much better control around
the<00:01:36.150> dock<00:01:36.329> without<00:01:36.630> overcorrecting

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.960 

that's<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.500> for<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.710> speed<00:01:42.950> functions<00:01:43.430> now

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
that's it for the speed functions now

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.520 
that's it for the speed functions now
another<00:01:44.210> huge<00:01:44.450> benefit<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.870> this<00:01:45.020> system<00:01:45.380> is

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
another huge benefit of this system is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.860 
another huge benefit of this system is
the<00:01:45.560> map<00:01:45.890> display<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.970> comes<00:01:47.210> with<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> base<00:01:47.660> map

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
the map display it comes with a base map

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.290 
the map display it comes with a base map
that<00:01:48.110> accepts<00:01:48.440> Navionics<00:01:48.890> cards<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:50.030> means

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
that accepts Navionics cards this means

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.030
