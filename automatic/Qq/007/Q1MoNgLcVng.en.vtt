pitch there's got to be a huge level of
accountability<00:00:21.369> so<00:00:22.179> what<00:00:22.720> we<00:00:22.869> do<00:00:23.019> is<00:00:23.050> we<00:00:23.289> put

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
accountability so what we do is we put

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.810 
accountability so what we do is we put
up<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.710> list<00:00:23.890> of<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.099> players<00:00:24.339> that<00:00:24.429> played<00:00:24.699> on

the wall and they have what we called
defensive<00:00:26.320> one-liners<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:27.609> it's<00:00:27.759> my

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
defensive one-liners so it's my

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
the people of missed tackles as well so

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.240 
the people of missed tackles as well so
there'll<00:00:47.289> be<00:00:47.320> an<00:00:47.469> individual<00:00:47.890> have<00:00:48.039> missed

don't click that coastal
ocean<00:01:35.710> levels<00:01:36.009> up<00:01:36.189> I'm<00:01:36.520> mostly<00:01:36.579> probably

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
ocean levels up I'm mostly probably

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.209 
ocean levels up I'm mostly probably
think<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.569> their<00:01:37.749> communication<00:01:38.499> levels<00:01:38.859> it's

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
think of their communication levels it's

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.520 
think of their communication levels it's
gonna<00:01:39.399> happen<00:01:39.520> again<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.229> primary

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
gonna happen again and the primary

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.300 
gonna happen again and the primary
reason<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.159> what<00:01:43.409> we're<00:01:44.409> not<00:01:44.560> talking<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.159> one

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
reason is what we're not talking to one

reason is what we're not talking to one
another<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.850> half<00:01:46.689> time<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.200> said<00:01:47.409> some<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.679> I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
another a half time I said some that I

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.139 
another a half time I said some that I
felt<00:01:47.979> that<00:01:48.069> defensively<00:01:48.609> we<00:01:48.700> were<00:01:48.850> heading

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
felt that defensively we were heading

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.359 
felt that defensively we were heading
for<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.359> fall<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.899> we'd<00:01:50.560> gone<00:01:50.770> what<00:01:50.979> was<00:01:51.069> three

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
for a fall and we'd gone what was three

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.279 
for a fall and we'd gone what was three
hours<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.759> rugby<00:01:52.030> with<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> Samoa<00:01:52.719> game<00:01:52.990> with

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
hours of rugby with a to Samoa game with

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.449 
hours of rugby with a to Samoa game with
two<00:01:53.439> hours<00:01:53.619> against<00:01:53.829> Samoa<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> first

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
two hours against Samoa and the first

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:55.859 
two hours against Samoa and the first
having<00:01:54.729> Scotland<00:01:55.060> not<00:01:55.149> having<00:01:55.359> conceded<00:01:55.689> a

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
having Scotland not having conceded a

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.109 
having Scotland not having conceded a
try<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.439> but<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> writing<00:01:57.579> for<00:01:57.789> me<00:01:57.880> was<00:01:58.030> on

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
try and but the writing for me was on

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.699 
try and but the writing for me was on
the<00:01:58.209> wall<00:01:58.359> that<00:01:58.390> we<00:01:58.599> would<00:01:58.719> creak<00:01:58.959> in<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.530> that

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
the wall that we would creak in and that

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.709 
the wall that we would creak in and that
proved<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.280> ring<00:02:00.759> true<00:02:00.789> in<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.209> second<00:02:01.569> half

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
proved to ring true in the second half

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.109 
proved to ring true in the second half
so<00:02:02.140> though<00:02:02.829> there's<00:02:03.130> definitely<00:02:03.609> clear

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
so though there's definitely clear

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.749 
so though there's definitely clear
lessons<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.020> learned<00:02:05.319> going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.799> into<00:02:06.310> Game

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
got a very strong set piece or we you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.539 
got a very strong set piece or we you
know<00:02:20.110> if<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.590> party<00:02:21.069> there<00:02:21.340> then

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
that's the best we can hope for is just

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.680 
that's the best we can hope for is just
a<00:02:23.319> case<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.530> us<00:02:23.799> being<00:02:24.700> as<00:02:24.910> clinical<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.540> X

a case of us being as clinical and X
cubed<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.079> our<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:27.099> attack<00:02:27.579> as<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.359> have

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
cubed in our or attack as we have

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.830 
cubed in our or attack as we have
particularly<00:02:29.319> get<00:02:29.440> into<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:29.890> more<00:02:29.920> game

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
particularly get into some more game

arrow<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.829> we<00:03:02.889> got<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.040> turnover<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:03.639> one

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
arrow and we got the turnover that one

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670 
arrow and we got the turnover that one
of<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.940> game<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.690> am<00:03:04.870> confident<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.530> do
