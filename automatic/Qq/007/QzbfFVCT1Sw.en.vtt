00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.200
 swimming is for man the art of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.769
 move in the water by its sole force 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
 physical 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
 it's the English in 1837 that make it 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 a codified sport by launching the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 first international competitions 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.590
 sports swimming includes four 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 different strokes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 the crawl brews the butterfly swim and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 swimming on the back a pretty activity 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560
 complete without trauma one is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 really to gravity in the water the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
 swimming techniques are still pretty 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.570
 difficult to take from the youngest 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.070
 age we do not want to escape a forced 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.059
 to really work on it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 educational swimming 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 we often start with the do sul by the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 crawl brew and butterfly but really 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.430
 for age categories a little more 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 high swimming is a complete sport 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.270
 that uses all the muscles 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 upper and lower limbs as well 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 that the back and the abdominals participate in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 the propulsion and the maintenance of the body to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 the surface shoulders and pecs 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 is developing rapidly and gives 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.520
 torso swimmers this shape so 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.510
 particular in inverted triangle the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 station a double interest 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.659
 she will develop qualities 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.619
 cardiovascular because it's a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.080
 endurance sport 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.119
 and then it will develop qualities 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 muscular and there all the muscles are 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.850
 sought 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.369
 swimming will develop qualities 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.619
 endurance toughness in the effort it's a 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.960
 difficult sport so you have to have a 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.520
 good mental to be able to train 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.649
 long enough to make 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.090
 back and forth in a track before 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.009
 to practice swimming like any 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.140
 sporting activity feeding of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.670
 stay balanced and varied to bring 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.350
 everything the body needs during 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.390
 the effort the first religion is 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 first a magnetization so diversify 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.020
 then like any sporting activity 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 you have to have fuel and the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.319
 fuel it's starchy it's up to 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.800
 to say it's slow sugar so we know 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.500
 very well 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.550
 hydration is used to help fight 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.159
 thermal 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.799
 of course in the water there is no 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.780
 thermal struggle at this level but by 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.409
 against a requirement of a good 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.450
 hydration 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.220
 simply because the performance 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.950
 physical muscle performance 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.200
 request to have a good hydration the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.580
 swimming a huge interest compared to 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.869
 a lot of transport is that it's 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.759
 a sport that is practiced in landfill 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.050
 say that the patient did not get in between 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.729
 quotes the weight of his body on his 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.650
 joints in particular of the limb 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.120
 lower knee and ankle and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 so for patients who for example 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.670
 present cartilage lesions of the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.680
 knee 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.060
 swimming remains a sport quite 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.129
 indicated it allows to maintain 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.319
 the articular amplitude it allows for 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.239
 gain muscle strength by exercising 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.620
 no constraint on this articulation 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.269
 as could do for example the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.590
 running though some hardships get 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.750
 Relay as a team 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.489
 swimming remains an individual sport 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.080
 it can be practiced from the youngest 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.890
 age and she is so much appreciated 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.110
 boys only girls 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 knowing how to swim is always beneficial for 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 yourself or to help and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.180
 to save someone from drowning 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.590
 that's why swimming is part 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.819
 physical education programs and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.819
 sports from primary school
