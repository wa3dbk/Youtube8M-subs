 further in the program on the marathon track 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.260
 our correspondent Alexander is working

 Dakar continues to gain momentum and 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.390
 adds to the list of losses among the participants 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.610
 further the race will go without one of 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.470
 KAMAZ crew after Ayrat Mardeev 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.650
 coup at the previous stage all the same 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.270
 excluded from the number of applicants for success he 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.980
 was actually the first truck by 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.110
 walking along a dirt road which 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.519
 proved unable to withstand weight 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.640
 kamaz there really is such a bottleneck 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.949
 breakage breakage chick small rated 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.080
 went with a month situation place principle 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.330
 for us it was enough here 2 started to cross 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.610
 this gully before jumped up and slightly 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.010
 landed landed and under our 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.540
 the left side just collapsed and everything 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.540
 car tilted 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.810
 until the last tried not to pull but 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.550
 the cream was already too big a car 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.330
 laid down an analog of the damage so strong 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.830
 since there is not sand but rocky 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.440
 stony tough terrain we therefore 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.130
 and did not expect to collapse 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.150
 under the left side everything is calm on 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.010
 this is a bottleneck we climbed the crew spent 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.110
 almost a whole night near the damaged 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.880
 car before help arrived not 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.200
 had enough water had to buy it in 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.010
 tridoroga local population 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.290
 but already managed powder for ages knife 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.540
 technician for technically stopped by two 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.800
 triangles big succeeded only 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.300
 put the car on the wheels and pull out 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.110
 it was impossible to start such a car 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.600
 on more 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.490
 almost 10 hours stood on top 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.290
 feet all the oil flowed out practically or 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.550
 motors from all nodes therefore had to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.210
 on tight coupling and drag already 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.520
 achieve 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.190
 we all have no roof 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.080
 broke and we just took off the door but in all 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.600
 three tables back doors from arrested but 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.810
 cabin whose feelings led so to speak 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.070
 , we have a need not have such fear 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.870
 mother of one pilot from them does not mean 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.549
 rejection of claims to win after all 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.290
 kamaz everyone is able to fight for 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.760
 podium 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.860
 another confirmation of this came in 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.930
 the triumph of Andrei Karginov in the third 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.299
 stage of the rally-marathon and in fact the night before 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.019
 start andrew his not stalin strong 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.420
 bronchitis 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.790
 but winning is only possible ground I 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.590
 the terrible work of the entire crew mechanic 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.330
 monitor all devices for 7 and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.799
 by sensors 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.900
 main task of the pressure in the tire 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.470
 he works constantly if speed 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.150
 increase much pressure 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.270
 increasing the speed reduce the pressure 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.420
 decreases navigator naturally his 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.270
 the task of making a legend go who 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.770
 without implicitly that is so like i'm to 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.480
 he got used to him he needs me 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.360
 dictate well and I do my job 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.820
 mutual understanding 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.490
 just an inner mindset 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.950
 of this 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.080
 time to endure overcome and not 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.300
 distracted by the heat as you forget about 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.860
 forget about it all remains without 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.220
 participate crew car 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.210
 how the car behaves well principle 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.210
 remark no but 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.710
 Tomashevsky 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.840
 in the overall standings among trucks first 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.400
 place to hold head health 4 place 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.910
 got fat hands not only thanks 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 speeds 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.130
 he was deducted from the overall result of 22 minutes 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.600
 which he allegedly spent to help 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.880
 bath compatriot 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.620
 he himself was already coming to the bivouac 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.800
 kamaz and claims that no help 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.420
 there was again the world tricks on the third 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.280
 stage of the Russian trucks have arisen 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.990
 problems with the wheels at once two do not look like 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.540
 struck by Anton Shibalov one more 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.460
 Edward the century triumph of the past year 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.210
 very worried including because 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.210
 which can not 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.360
 first stop was a minute and a half this 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.790
 we saw that the hole is small in 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.540
 wheel times others say that with the beginning 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.490
 of my 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.730
 hit a sharp stone like a knife 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.690
 pierce and decided to go further on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.030
 paging having driven 10 kilometers hole 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.270
 everything expanded and the pressure in the wheel 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.720
 left of course I had to stop 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.530
 in the end, one and a half of these 10 thousand about 12 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.780
 minutes twelve minutes half an hour even an hour 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.370
 need korea is keeping up blood to 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.080
 the same team San traditionally better 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.090
 manages the second part of the race when and 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.660
 cars are slightly worn and people are already 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.690
 tired 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.220
 and the weather does not whisper commodity Argentine 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.320
 the sun and the first three stages in this 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.450
 hospitable but very hot and how 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.910
 it turned out not friendly for the Russians 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.590
 country like a cow tongue licked one of 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.960
 the strongest cargo crews 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.210
 Dakar 2014 is one of the Russian 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.380

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.910
 Ayrata Mardeeva 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.710
 and now the rest have to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.290
 work for yourself and for that guy 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.600
 But Chelnins not get used and they 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.520
 I will try Alexander Grishin and substances 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.520
 from bear santan argentina 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.779
 our appeal against the decision of the judges to give 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:12.939
 the hero of 22 minutes did not succeed 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.849

00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:29.349
 batteries failed handwriting 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.209
 KAMAZ himself no stranger to this 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.159
 relation as soon as possible 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.739
 Russian poprizhat organizers not

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.219
 in politics 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:50.709
 in the end, so was this acceptance by us 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.199
 of the law banning gay propaganda so 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.059
