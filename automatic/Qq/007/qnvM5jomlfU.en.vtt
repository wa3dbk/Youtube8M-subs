Microsoft it is now put their own logo
on<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> box<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.099> once<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> pick<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> up

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on the box so once we can pick it up

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.310 
on the box so once we can pick it up
here<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.400> it<00:00:29.400> comes<00:00:30.210> off<00:00:30.359> standard<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
here and it comes off standard like the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
here and it comes off standard like the
original<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.910> does<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.149> touch

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
original one this one does not touch

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
original one this one does not touch
cover<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.559> thinner<00:00:34.860> than<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
cover so it's a bit thinner than this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.209 
cover so it's a bit thinner than this
one<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.840> simply<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.010> take

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
one and you will just simply and take

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.840 
one and you will just simply and take
that<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.700> slide<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> box<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:43.850> same

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that off and slide the box up and same

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.750 
that off and slide the box up and same
again<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.450> though<00:00:45.920> one<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.489> once

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
again just though one here that once

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
again just though one here that once
this<00:00:48.059> one's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.899> harder<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.620> off

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
this one's a bit harder it's going off

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.040 
this one's a bit harder it's going off
and<00:00:53.960> I'll<00:00:54.960> crumbs<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:57.780> new<00:00:57.960> surface<00:00:58.760> now

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
and I'll crumbs the new surface now

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
and I'll crumbs the new surface now
right<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.949> new<00:01:02.399> charger

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
right here you have the new charger

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
right here you have the new charger
which<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.860> part<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> bit

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
which this part right here it's a bit

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.289 
which this part right here it's a bit
more<00:01:06.570> triangle<00:01:07.470> prism<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> bit

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
more triangle prism like so it's a bit

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
more triangle prism like so it's a bit
easier<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> grip<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.049> hand<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
easier to grip in your hand and then you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
easier to grip in your hand and then you
can't<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.119> camera<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> not

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
can't see on camera but this is not

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.960 
can't see on camera but this is not
going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> focus<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:15.030> maybe<00:01:15.740> no<00:01:16.939> okay<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
going to focus right maybe no okay I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
going to focus right maybe no okay I
guess<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.080> sin

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
guess not but if you can see all my sin

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730 
guess not but if you can see all my sin
my<00:01:19.890> thumb<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.409> where<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> light<00:01:22.710> comes

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
my thumb is that where the light comes

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
my thumb is that where the light comes
on<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:24.210> actually<00:01:24.659> charge<00:01:25.080> thing<00:01:25.640> which

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
on now to actually charge thing which

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.810 
on now to actually charge thing which
makes<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.330> bit<00:01:28.200> too<00:01:28.229> cool<00:01:30.079> here<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.530> the
