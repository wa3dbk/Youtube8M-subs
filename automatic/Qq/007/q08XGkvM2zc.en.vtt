00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.670
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.299
 your jumping down through your arms 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.299
 teaching 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 so that thus did not ever we 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.550
 start by making us one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.279
 object looking for a barrier for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 assume that my couch is here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 then I hold a hand to the couch 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 and on the other hand I have that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.270
 Yummy with whom I ikarus to others 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 pull side 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 I prefer the most tricks I give you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 Show him the first time 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 and now it is still a bit 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.630
 awkward but that changes soon 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.520
 and have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.049
 Here I do not have the leckerli in 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 the hand should have it on the other 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.340
 not laid rigorously 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.829
 and because he does not quite understand that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.969
 I want what I want from him 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.380
 again the exercises started 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.729
 screw back and again as 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 Tasty hand to have and still 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.259
 to show what he has to do 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.650
 after a few repetitions, I begin 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 then try again like ikarus 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.820
 not the yummy thing does not react to that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 in the hand and also here at the beginning 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.520
 he does not quite understand what I mean by 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.479
 I want to show him the yummy 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 Once again Jacob and finally it works 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.259
 if your dog ikarus down here through 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.209
 you want to say no 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.130
 send her back at the end 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.880
 shows the yummy and then says yes 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 once again rob 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.190
 then you not only have your arm on the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.790
 couch but also a arm over the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.590
 dog stretched and then you see 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.270
 that ikarus does not find that great 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.930
 But then it can motivate 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.930
 go through 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.990
 and has 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.900
 if that works without problems you can 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.250
 to put you down at the beginning and the poor ones like that 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.599
 as it now show down here too 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.599
 holding on to a circular shape 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.959
 and repeatedly repeated repeatedly 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 you repeatedly know that from others 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.150
 Exercises you repeat that always and 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.010
 again and again and gradually you can 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.709
 the circle that makes with your arms 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.069
 continue to pull up to your dog 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.730
 show that he has to skip a lot 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.730
 fun while training
