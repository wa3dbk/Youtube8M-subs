that doesn't take long but the only

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
that doesn't take long but the only
reason<00:01:39.000> why<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> decided<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> video<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
reason why I decided to do this video is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
reason why I decided to do this video is
because<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.210> looking<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.720> YouTube

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
