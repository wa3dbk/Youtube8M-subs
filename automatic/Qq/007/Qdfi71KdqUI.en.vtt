sure<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.409> next<00:02:00.590> card<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.100> opposite

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
sure that the next card is the opposite

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.670 
sure that the next card is the opposite
color<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.909> set<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.330> beside<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.810> first<00:02:03.020> card

facedown and you're going to just simply

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.250 
facedown and you're going to just simply
deal<00:02:09.079> them<00:02:09.319> into<00:02:09.769> two<00:02:10.009> separate<00:02:10.909> piles<00:02:11.599> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
deal them into two separate piles just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.040 
deal them into two separate piles just
like<00:02:12.499> so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
like so

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.870 
like so
okay<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.350> once<00:02:15.500> you've<00:02:15.620> dealt<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.340> even<00:02:16.640> piles

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
okay and once you've dealt to even piles

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.770 
okay and once you've dealt to even piles
just<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.300> that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
just like that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.470 
just like that
you<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:18.890> pick<00:02:19.040> up<00:02:19.190> any<00:02:19.370> one<00:02:19.430> pile<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.150> turn

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you can pick up any one pile and turn

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
you can pick up any one pile and turn
them<00:02:20.660> face<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.190> see<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
them face up and you can just see you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.950 
them face up and you can just see you
should<00:02:22.610> have<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> nice<00:02:22.970> mix<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.450> red<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.840> black

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960

should have a nice mix of red and black
cards<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.270> face<00:02:26.450> up<00:02:26.660> pile<00:02:26.870> you're

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
cards now with this face up pile you're

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.480 
cards now with this face up pile you're
going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> leave<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> table<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.220> so

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
going to leave that on the table like so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.930 
going to leave that on the table like so
and<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.420> other<00:02:29.540> pile<00:02:29.840> face<00:02:30.290> down<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:31.730> what

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and the other pile face down now what

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.010 
and the other pile face down now what
we're<00:02:32.090> going<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.240> do<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.660> we're<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.960> just

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
we're going to do is we're going to just

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.080 
we're going to do is we're going to just
test<00:02:33.470> our<00:02:33.620> intuition<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.730> see<00:02:34.940> how

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
test our intuition is and to see how

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.760 
test our intuition is and to see how
well<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.690> match<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.290> red<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.620> black

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
well we can match up the red and black

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.760 
well we can match up the red and black
cards<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.210> do<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.510> what<00:02:39.290> I'd<00:02:39.410> like<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
cards so to do this what I'd like you to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.820 
cards so to do this what I'd like you to
do<00:02:39.890> first<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.250> all<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:41.630> one<00:02:41.720> moment<00:02:41.990> is<00:02:42.770> a

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
do first of all in just one moment is a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.680 
do first of all in just one moment is a
move<00:02:43.130> one<00:02:43.430> card<00:02:43.730> from<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> top<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.480> pile

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
move one card from the top of the pile

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110 
move one card from the top of the pile
to<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.110> bottom<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> pile<00:02:45.770> ten<00:02:46.370> times<00:02:46.730> any

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
to the bottom of the pile ten times any

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.140 
to the bottom of the pile ten times any
way<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.510> wish<00:02:47.870> from<00:02:48.110> swapping<00:02:49.070> between<00:02:49.190> each

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
way you wish from swapping between each

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.720 
way you wish from swapping between each
piles<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.780> what<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.020> mean<00:02:51.200> by<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.770> for

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
piles so what I mean by that is for

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.310 
piles so what I mean by that is for
instance<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.270> could<00:02:53.330> move<00:02:53.600> ten<00:02:53.930> cards<00:02:54.200> like

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
instance I could move ten cards like

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.220 
instance I could move ten cards like
this<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.620> could<00:02:54.740> go<00:02:54.860> one<00:02:55.160> two<00:02:55.910> three<00:02:56.720> from<00:02:56.959> top

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
this I could go one two three from top

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.699 
this I could go one two three from top
to<00:02:57.260> bottom

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
to bottom

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.550 
to bottom
four<00:02:58.280> five<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.420> then<00:02:59.600> maybe<00:02:59.810> at<00:03:00.080> any<00:03:00.230> time

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
four five and then maybe at any time

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.449 
four five and then maybe at any time
move<00:03:01.340> over<00:03:01.459> continuing<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.240> count<00:03:02.480> six<00:03:03.459> seven

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
move over continuing to count six seven

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.610 
move over continuing to count six seven
eight<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.820> maybe<00:03:05.390> back<00:03:05.600> over<00:03:06.020> whenever<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
eight and maybe back over whenever I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.440 
eight and maybe back over whenever I
feel<00:03:06.920> nine<00:03:07.820> ten<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.620> okay<00:03:10.450> now

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
feel nine ten just like that okay now

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.390 
feel nine ten just like that okay now
the<00:03:11.510> two<00:03:12.050> cards<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.530> are<00:03:12.620> remaining<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.130> top

the two cards that are remaining on top

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.570 
the two cards that are remaining on top
you're<00:03:13.940> going<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> take<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.510> obvious<00:03:14.870> card

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you're going to take the obvious card

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.460 
you're going to take the obvious card
that<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.730> see<00:03:17.060> face-up<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.780> set<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.230> with

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that you can see face-up and set it with

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.460 
that you can see face-up and set it with
the<00:03:19.280> appropriate<00:03:19.870> indicator<00:03:20.870> card<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> same

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
the appropriate indicator card the same

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.770 
the appropriate indicator card the same
color<00:03:21.709> card<00:03:22.040> okay<00:03:22.610> now<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.239> opposite

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
color card okay now the opposite

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.630 
color card okay now the opposite
facedown<00:03:24.230> mystery<00:03:24.709> card<00:03:24.980> you're<00:03:25.430> going<00:03:25.550> to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
facedown mystery card you're going to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.449 
facedown mystery card you're going to
set<00:03:25.820> at<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> opposite<00:03:26.989> indicator<00:03:27.440> card<00:03:27.739> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
set at the opposite indicator card to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.370 
set at the opposite indicator card to
keep<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.730> piles<00:03:28.970> even<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.660> we're<00:03:30.140> just<00:03:30.230> going

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
keep the piles even and we're just going

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.350 
keep the piles even and we're just going
to<00:03:30.470> hope<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.310> card<00:03:31.610> matches<00:03:32.180> our

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
to hope that this card matches our

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.240 
to hope that this card matches our
indicator<00:03:32.780> card<00:03:33.080> but<00:03:33.709> we'll<00:03:33.860> find<00:03:34.070> out<00:03:34.220> later

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
indicator card but we'll find out later

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.699 
indicator card but we'll find out later
so<00:03:34.760> once<00:03:35.660> you've<00:03:35.780> done<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.380> go<00:03:36.590> ahead

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
so once you've done that so you go ahead

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.680 
so once you've done that so you go ahead
and<00:03:37.040> move<00:03:37.280> ten<00:03:37.550> cards<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.120> how<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> did

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and move ten cards just like how I did

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.259 
and move ten cards just like how I did
similar<00:03:39.170> way<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:40.370> use<00:03:40.519> your<00:03:40.550> intuition

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
similar way and just use your intuition

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.380 
similar way and just use your intuition
to<00:03:41.870> just<00:03:42.080> move<00:03:42.590> between<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.130> piles<00:03:43.370> as<00:03:43.730> you're

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
to just move between the piles as you're

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.780 
to just move between the piles as you're
counting<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.989> once<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> arrive<00:03:46.340> at<00:03:46.489> your<00:03:46.519> two

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
counting and once you arrive at your two

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.440 
counting and once you arrive at your two
cards<00:03:47.739> set<00:03:48.739> them<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.580> face-up<00:03:49.910> card<00:03:50.269> at<00:03:50.360> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
cards set them the face-up card at the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.410 
cards set them the face-up card at the
appropriate<00:03:50.930> indicating<00:03:51.830> color<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
appropriate indicating color and the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.690 
appropriate indicating color and the
opposite<00:03:53.930> facedown<00:03:54.410> mystery<00:03:54.920> card<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
opposite indicator card okay so once

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.949 
opposite indicator card okay so once
you've<00:03:58.970> done<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.150> we're<00:03:59.480> going<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.630> move<00:03:59.780> on

three four five six seven eight nine

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.820 
three four five six seven eight nine
something<00:04:11.330> like<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.720> it's<00:04:12.080> just<00:04:12.260> nine<00:04:12.500> moves

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
something like that it's just nine moves

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.120 
something like that it's just nine moves
just<00:04:13.130> like<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:13.549> I'm<00:04:14.420> gonna<00:04:14.630> set<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.680> obvious

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
just like so I'm gonna set this obvious

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.849 
just like so I'm gonna set this obvious
red<00:04:16.489> card<00:04:16.790> with<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.030> red<00:04:17.209> indicator<00:04:17.780> card<00:04:18.080> and

the opposite mystery card in the
opposite<00:04:20.750> pile<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.660> okay<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:23.810> you

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
opposite pile just like that okay so you

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.930 
opposite pile just like that okay so you
got<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.140> idea<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.370> if<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.580> could<00:04:25.700> just<00:04:25.729> keep

got the idea so if you could just keep

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.920 
got the idea so if you could just keep
up<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.450> we'll<00:04:26.630> move

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
