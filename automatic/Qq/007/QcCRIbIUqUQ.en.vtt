00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 two 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.490
 I had uploaded a cover of him just alone 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.130
 I'm going to do it in two parts, one 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.180
 explaining the full commission and other 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.340
 explaining that they are 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.340
 in the song is in all of me 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.200
 so this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 m 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 4 between this number 9 and then 7 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.700
 a mother 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.850
 no way 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 Hello 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.900
 by understanding 5 to 1 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.619
 9 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.280
 and we make a tone 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.619
 with 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 m 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 Y 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.020
 49 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.360
 starting with the same 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.379
 and in the last part to finish it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.379
 it makes it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.830
 s 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.260
 once 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.260
 yes 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
 in first and second string in 13 7 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.520
 two 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.520
 and it was spent inside 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.049
 from there 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.760
 Yes Yes 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.180
 before the very simple verse 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.560
 then in the color of the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.310
 and this 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220
 we wanted that sound 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.440
 the intro the verse in the chorus 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.150
 are the chords that are also compared 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.150
 in someone but I would grow in this 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.630
 is all there is at the base of the 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.140
 song is a song and then it's 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.140
 simple 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:31.210
 this is the choir part 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:36.880
 and the look is held 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:39.090
 the same song ends like this 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.090
 do not 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 and 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.569
 in 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:05.910
 tomorrow in the sun video 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.910
 and friends 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.680
 one 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.569
 and 2 share 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.569
 all right
