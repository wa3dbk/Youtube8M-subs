00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
my girls told me something really

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.949 
my girls told me something really
interesting<00:03:01.360> about<00:03:01.720> these<00:03:02.140> two<00:03:02.200> because

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
interesting about these two because

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.630 
interesting about these two because
they're<00:03:04.959> not<00:03:05.079> Brennan<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.220> why<00:03:06.370> are<00:03:06.430> they

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
they're not Brennan so why are they

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.080

together

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
together

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.910 
together
oh<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:10.180> probably<00:03:10.599> thinking<00:03:11.200> because<00:03:11.769> it's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
oh I'm probably thinking because it's

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.030 
oh I'm probably thinking because it's
like<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.880> came<00:03:13.290> probably<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> pack<00:03:14.769> like

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
like it came probably in the pack like

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.780 
like it came probably in the pack like
that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.400 
that
and<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.120> was<00:03:16.239> probably<00:03:16.389> thinking<00:03:16.870> because

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and I was probably thinking because

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.220 
and I was probably thinking because
since<00:03:17.980> they're<00:03:18.280> enemies<00:03:19.109> Applejack's<00:03:20.109> trying

since they're enemies Applejack's trying

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.059 
since they're enemies Applejack's trying
to<00:03:20.500> get<00:03:20.799> whatever<00:03:21.790> her<00:03:22.180> name<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:23.530> Chavez

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
to get whatever her name is now Chavez

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.460 
to get whatever her name is now Chavez
looms<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.970> Apple<00:03:25.510> Bloom<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.989> Applejack

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470

sister<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:29.069> she's<00:03:30.069> probably<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.329> middle

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
sister and she's probably in the middle

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.990 
sister and she's probably in the middle
teeth<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.620> she<00:03:32.859> was<00:03:32.980> in<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.190> middle<00:03:33.459> she

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
teeth that she was in the middle she

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.430 
teeth that she was in the middle she
