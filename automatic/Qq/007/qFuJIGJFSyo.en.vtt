00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.939
 right and run as administrator 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.530
 then wait to go to next at the end 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.719
 will ask if you want to open the program 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.299
 I already have it installed now I'm going to 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.220
 register very important as they saw in 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.110
 the presentation video is associated with 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.759
 Movistar and you can only register if 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.259
 You have a number from that company 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.940
 if you have clear personal or any 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.610
 another company you will not be able to register 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.959
 which is only exclusive to movistar a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.970
 Once we place our number of 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.650
 movistar we mark the term box 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.420
 if we accept and we will receive a 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.739
 message with the code to verify that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.739
 we really have that number 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.180
 We wait a moment for the arrival of the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.630
 message and then we copy it and we give in 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.630
 following 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.019
 here you ask us access to our network I 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.650
 also allow access to networks 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.650
 public 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.239
 now we put a password with a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.650
 minimum of 7 to 12 characters can be 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.190
 numbers and letters in lowercase or 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.190
 capital letters 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.080
 ok our account is now ready now 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.569
 I will try to log in to the west 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.010
 taxi in my tree I still do not have any 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.310
 contact as he tells me he believes in 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.310
 windows 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.510
 we just have to open the application and 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.980
 then in I'm already registered we put 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.980
 our number and password and ready 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.230
 tags on websites not have contacts is 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.790
 that's why everything appears empty only 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.470
 I'm showing you that without any kind 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.850
 of problem can be used in vigo is 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.340
 made any other device with 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.340
 Android now try on my ipod 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.730
 it's the same procedure once again 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.540
 we just have to enter with our 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.540
 number and password 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.000
 in this case I will see my contacts but 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.000
 still none use this application 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.710
 in adjustment we can see the data and 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.900
 also on what devices our 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.570
 account is active as well as the history 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.580
 we can also close another session 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.580
 device linked to our account 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.950
 I tried to send a somewhat stupid message 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.140
 from me since I did it from the ipod 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.550
 xd but if this contact had the 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.840
 application would send it without any 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.840
 problem through wifi 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.820
 this application allows you to have the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.860
 same number on different devices 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.600
 something like whatsapp but all 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.250
 we know that whatsapp can only be had 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.080
 on a device and also now no longer 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.670
 it's free it's not important it's not 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.290
 It is necessary that your contact use this 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.760
 application in my case I do not send the 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.770
 message because I did it from the iphone 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.270
 which does not use a chip if they want it to 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.720
 another video with one more explanation to 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.190
 background 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.690
