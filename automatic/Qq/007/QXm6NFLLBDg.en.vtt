00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello and welcome back as he contacts Unique User 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.580
 again to the general 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.730
 we keep the vortex worried one side is formal 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.289
 Koblenz 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.480
 is a page 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.999
 easy 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.230
 he only said, "It's good that a lot of things worked out 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.449
 and 19 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.449
 yet could English name as the best contribution 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 that would be for 1 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 it would be now 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.920
 lost 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 and benefit more 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.930
 if you turn it upside down 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 then they come to him 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.660
 environment 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 the security is bet 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 it is far surpassed 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 that will also be towed explained 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.200
 he hears hearing 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.460
 that would 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.420
 from 2 4 percent 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.280
 and you can get it through a night cream Prof 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060
 Well 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.630
 Prof 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 b 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.670
 Prof 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.480
 he is through an 11th 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 It would be possible to do a lot 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.720
 first visit and a known 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 the proof does not see a victory 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.390
 i want him the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 the children and forth 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.920
 So the differences 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.040
 we also kick those knees 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.650
 under the red sand 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.690
 So here I am 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.930
 Dahlmann Drink up 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.580
 and Oliver a praise my cross occupied 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.119
 and Merkel the right cornerstone coalition and third, the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419
 stretch 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.429
 97 points 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 GM will not be successful any more 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:22.139
 and tear gas before dpa that is the goal but give away is 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.019
 now rather put the other two sides pull 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.499
 must refill once 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.359
 17 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 get rid of the judges in front 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.769
 Chiropodist the two sides 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.959
 the lower two sides are enough 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.359
 and Ramos up Bruns 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.139
 I bow to them 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.389
 and he announces the files to Mexicana Click 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.429
 yes, the differences 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.779
 is under pressure since 4 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.679
 rush hour 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.049
 and be content with space 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 where is the next way could be 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.819
 which he has now 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.809
 and then 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.049
 it lacks APA 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.459
 to look deeply 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.829
 because you have to make an effort to turn up a visit in the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.109
 when we have reached our destination the board 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.469
 Now we want the experts 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.039
 on 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.479
 Huemer late the stone 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.599
 it contains 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.909
 not clear 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.909
 hot drinks in under the s &amp; p but 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.879
 here 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.459
 Prof 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.559
 May off 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.029
 she has grote 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.119
 could here 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 Knaup 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.079
 Well, then comes our first virtuoso and player alike 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.079
 and then the 2 Daniel Kiptum 1 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.229
 Quick on-site offer further over discovered 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:07.509
 and, of course, great 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.249
 there from 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.479
 Century n century on the 1st 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.739
 I know in Merkel it will change 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.000
 we've done it now it's close to ten up here 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.620
 customer data 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.349
 Pilstl Nextel Corp. 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.110
 clear 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.090
 bookable 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.080
 they get it and I believe 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.020
 continue 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.100
 and another break tip of 140 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.069
 why Knights wanted to have Peter Diamond Light's copy editing 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.559
 dpa Pride in the old Karmann plant remains 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.449
 Why 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.719
 si 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.559
 Korinek next corner 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.559
 and they left 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.620
 and to refuse Prahm strictly here 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.099
 Aachen 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.099
 and services 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.379
 Laitinen awaits d'alema Kepler has won 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.379
 Daun already worked the first time 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.659
 is good 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.729
 and Copenhagen here are the corner 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.650
 we reported 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.620
 Green the corn prices 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.630
 and after either far beyond Vettel Daniel Radcliffe's wide 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.520
 dpa 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.979
 300 planned at the Boxx markets 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:40.980
 save up 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.560
 he will give an easy way 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.259
 Danger 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.629
 and especially, he said 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.629
 St solved 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.150
 and she must have about a 4 1 IU 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.180
 she has that 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.750
