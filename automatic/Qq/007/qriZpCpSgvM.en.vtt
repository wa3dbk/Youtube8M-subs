00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.380
 that's a lot 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.300
 He stands by the nose of a research ship 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 and looks out to sea in front of him 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.070
 big icebergs pile up everywhere 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.499
 the snowy ice floe sees the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 floating on the water because his father 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.890
 researcher is likely for the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.679
 exceptionally on an expedition in the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.060
 accompany arctic 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.120
 the ship finally stops and they can 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.360
 to go off board instead of curious 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.880
 through the snow then it also catches 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 are snowing in itself because pleased to 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.770
 unfortunately snowing is rarely as 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.450
 Turn back and return to the ship 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060
 It is nowhere to be seen 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.000
 he is lost through the snow flurries 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.650
 what should only do 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.050
 suddenly he sees something in the distance 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.970
 it comes directly to him to four dogs 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 pull a sled on the one 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.030
 Girl sits the sled holds directly 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.239
 in front of him 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.610
 hey have you got lost ask this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.060
 Girl and offers to approach with her 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.569
 come 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.159
 The girl is now called Finn climbs up 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.370
 cut and cuddles in one 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.770
 thick fur blanket 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.530
 The dogs are running around the curves 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.840
 faster and faster on the ice is 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.770
 all the whistling of the wind and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 the breathe the unis listened once 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.510
 short on film calls suddenly there is ahead 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.220
 a little polar bear i think he needs 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.620
 Help 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.390
 and indeed the EisbÃ¤rbaby is up 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.280
 a flounder aborted and manages it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.840
 no longer on land 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 Now the boy brings safety and security 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.580
 set it to find the sled then 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.820
 tells you to find out about climate change and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.050
 what he means for the animals of the arctic 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 because it is getting warmer in the arctic 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.660
 the ice melts and the animals lose 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.970
 her home 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.920
 Sometimes even the young boy happened 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.930
 polar bears and other animals drown because 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.700
 not enough ice there is the away of 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.090
 one school is too long for the next one 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.860
 she adds sadly and this is 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.320
 way too small and can even 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.450
 not swimming properly 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 gradually it gets dark where we want 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.460
 then find the room to ask 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.350
 I can not see a house anywhere 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.240
 Only stated on the mainland 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.070
 now my family lives there too 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.080
 but if we are long on the road build 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.080
 we turn snow and ice into an igloo 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.580
 We can sleep on it shows her 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 find how to build one and build it 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.470
 second they have done quickly then 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 stings a small hole in the ice 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 what are you doing there I'm curious to know 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.209
 I angle answered now and pulls 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.540
 Immediately afterwards the first fish from the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.610
 water 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.130
 what have you caught enough fish? 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.709
 So that everyone will be full, he finds now 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.150
 make a campfire and eat too 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.020
 little polar bear and the sled dogs 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.180
 pounce on their food hungry 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.160
 later they are still sitting warm 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.920
 fire looks up in the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.300
 starry sky he has so many stars 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 never seen the whole sky is 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.480
 But what is it that sees it? 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.240
 like a huge green veil and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.120
 moves that are auragic calls 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.770
 Now it's thrilling to put it 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.040
 be observed on the ground, the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.110
 flickering green lights as she gets tired 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 they'll crawl into the igloo 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.220
 surprised how warm it is inside covers 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.880
 itself with a thick field and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.210
 falls asleep 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.980
 what an exciting day the next 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.780
 tomorrow they will be deafening 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.180
 noise and a strong jerking awakened 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.010
 he jumps up startled 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.440
 and look out they see you 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.120
 huge icebreaker something big behind 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.560
 Now one pulls one gets very pale 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.630
 she tells you to find that lately 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.030
 More and more people are coming to the Arctic 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.410
 here to drill for oil 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.240
 the big thing of the ship 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.190
 being pulled is an oil rig 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.370
 With that, people can be deeply under the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.570
 drilling seabed for oil then says 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.660
 that is very dangerous for the animals 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.160
 because it makes noise and dirt excited 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.810
 he now finds the ship running 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.890
 afterwards and almost stumble over 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.570
 a small polar fox of the poor ones 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.430
 then a puddle fell and be 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.000
 nice white coat is all black and 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.950
 glued that comes from the ships and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.040
 the rigs lose the oil scolds 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.170
 Angry now they are trying that 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.790
 to clear polar foxes from the oil, however 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.880
 it is difficult the sticky stuff 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.350
 get out of the field again 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.420
 suddenly a small one is holding next to them 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.210
 inflatable boat and a man and a woman 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.220
 get out there are environmentalists 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.960
 They traveled to the North Pole because they 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.690
 the arctic and the animals you live 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.030
 the ships want to save oil 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.890
 make way too much broken we want 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.110
 that the big ships from the arctic 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.410
 disappear the drilling prohibited for oil 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.840
 becomes 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.669
 we need a nature reserve emi 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.370
 Animals in peace can say that 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.530
 Environmentalists like the idea 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.180
 that the arctic be protected because he 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.740
 would like to help the environmentalists and 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.419
 He promises that to all his friends 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.470
 in Germany tell of the Arctic 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.420
 becomes 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.980
 the environmentalists offer to find him 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.710
 to bring back to his ship and 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.670
 So he climbs into the inflatable boat 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.990
 Do you find yourself a bit sad on 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.850
 He would love to stay here 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.160
 and with now on the little polar bear and 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.660
 the dogs like a Inuit live his 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.110
 Father is already worried 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.540
 around him 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.640
 Finn beckons for a long time without the animals 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.780
 afterwards and is quite sure that 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.780
 he will come back soon
