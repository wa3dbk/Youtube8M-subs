from<00:03:20.720> Ford<00:03:21.260> telling<00:03:21.860> us<00:03:21.980> what<00:03:22.250> they<00:03:22.490> would

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
from Ford telling us what they would

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.570 
from Ford telling us what they would
like<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.760> parse<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.300> P<00:03:23.570> from<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:24.800> will<00:03:25.010> go

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
like to parse so P from that we will go

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.550 
like to parse so P from that we will go
through<00:03:25.790> our<00:03:26.000> process<00:03:26.540> we<00:03:26.690> can<00:03:26.840> look<00:03:27.020> at<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.350> in

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
through our process we can look at it in

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.320 
through our process we can look at it in
