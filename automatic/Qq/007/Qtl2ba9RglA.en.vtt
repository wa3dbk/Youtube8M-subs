I don't think it does anything in
particular<00:01:36.580> I<00:01:37.150> think<00:01:37.210> it's<00:01:37.479> just<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:37.750> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
particular I think it's just like a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.290 
particular I think it's just like a
leftover<00:01:38.170> from<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.970> construction<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.270 
leftover from the construction of the
jacket<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:41.500> little<00:01:41.740> event<00:01:41.830> right<00:01:42.100> here<00:01:42.250> I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
jacket this little event right here I

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.310 
jacket this little event right here I
just<00:01:42.490> don't<00:01:43.030> find<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.330> that<00:01:43.450> attractive<00:01:44.020> in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
just don't find it that attractive in

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.660 
just don't find it that attractive in
fact<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.680> kind<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.890> reminds<00:01:45.100> me<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.369> like<00:01:45.490> that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670

black<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.500> really<00:02:02.740> don't<00:02:02.890> see<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.509> another

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
black you really don't see it another

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.840 
black you really don't see it another
thing<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.810> like<00:02:05.050> is<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.190> still<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.729> a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
thing I like is a and it's still just a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.190 
thing I like is a and it's still just a
styling<00:02:07.210> issue<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.600> wish<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.869> interior

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
styling issue is I wish the interior

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900

were<00:02:08.350> black<00:02:08.560> as<00:02:08.739> well<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.100> think<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.670> would<00:02:09.729> just

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
were black as well I think it would just

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.449 
were black as well I think it would just
match<00:02:10.119> with<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> black<00:02:10.690> exterior<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:12.280> for<00:02:12.400> a

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
match with the black exterior just for a

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.850 
match with the black exterior just for a
bit<00:02:12.670> more<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> low-profile<00:02:13.900> look<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.709> make

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
bit more of a low-profile look and make

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
bit more of a low-profile look and make
it<00:02:14.950> look<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.160> little<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.459> more<00:02:15.580> sleek<00:02:15.850> but

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360
