00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
blu-ray but when you have a graphics

card that it's four times as powerful as
a<00:03:30.330> 1080p<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.780> then<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.410> hear<00:03:32.560> someone<00:03:32.950> say

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
a 1080p and then you hear someone say

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.430 
a 1080p and then you hear someone say
I'm<00:03:33.670> getting<00:03:33.970> ps4<00:03:34.480> let's<00:03:34.720> say<00:03:34.810> their<00:03:34.989> next<00:03:35.260> box

I'm getting ps4 let's say their next box

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.600 
I'm getting ps4 let's say their next box
fan<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:37.000> has<00:03:37.180> better<00:03:37.480> graphics<00:03:37.750> I

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610

because what you're buying a console for

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.199 
because what you're buying a console for
better<00:03:47.260> graphics<00:03:47.770> honestly<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.550> xbox<00:03:48.910> and

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
better graphics honestly the xbox and

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.380 
better graphics honestly the xbox and
ps4<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.170> my<00:03:50.440> first<00:03:50.709> clamp<00:03:51.010> not<00:03:51.310> pays<00:03:51.489> for<00:03:51.700> the

ps4 and my first clamp not pays for the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.390 
ps4 and my first clamp not pays for the
seventh<00:03:53.370> 360<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:55.230> ps3<00:03:56.230> both<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.220> same

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
seventh 360 and the ps3 both of the same

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.729 
seventh 360 and the ps3 both of the same

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
graphics to the human eye to my I at

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.259 
graphics to the human eye to my I at
least<00:03:59.860> I've<00:04:00.160> seen<00:04:00.370> them<00:04:00.489> both<00:04:00.640> trust<00:04:00.940> me<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.090> go

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
least I've seen them both trust me I go

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.900 
least I've seen them both trust me I go
to<00:04:01.330> bestbuy<00:04:01.690> once<00:04:02.019> in<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.170> while<00:04:02.320> I'm<00:04:02.530> outside

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
to bestbuy once in a while I'm outside

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.240 
to bestbuy once in a while I'm outside
so<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.209> I'm<00:04:05.200> see<00:04:05.380> no<00:04:05.590> difference<00:04:05.800> there's<00:04:06.130> no

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
so I I'm see no difference there's no

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.699 
so I I'm see no difference there's no
visible<00:04:06.640> difference<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.959> can<00:04:08.140> see<00:04:08.290> for

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
visible difference that you can see for

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.050 
visible difference that you can see for
an<00:04:08.769> ordinary<00:04:08.980> person<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.580> mean<00:04:09.700> I'm<00:04:09.820> pretty

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
an ordinary person I mean I'm pretty

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.220 
an ordinary person I mean I'm pretty
sure<00:04:10.180> there<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.450> little<00:04:10.660> difference<00:04:11.110> you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
sure there is a little difference you

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.440 
sure there is a little difference you
know<00:04:11.290> maybe<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:11.800> one<00:04:11.950> more<00:04:12.160> pixel<00:04:12.700> but<00:04:13.269> there

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
know maybe like one more pixel but there

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.900 
know maybe like one more pixel but there
is<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.690> something<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.739> big<00:04:15.010> so<00:04:15.579> that's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
is it something so big so that's

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.550 
is it something so big so that's
people<00:04:16.060> actually<00:04:16.330> use<00:04:16.360> the<00:04:16.630> excuse<00:04:17.019> ps3<00:04:17.470> as

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
people actually use the excuse ps3 as

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.290 
people actually use the excuse ps3 as
better<00:04:17.769> graphics<00:04:18.190> by<00:04:18.310> fact<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.790> does<00:04:19.000> because

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
better graphics by fact it does because

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.910 
better graphics by fact it does because
that's<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.570> higher<00:04:19.690> graphics<00:04:20.140> card<00:04:20.350> processor

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
that's a higher graphics card processor

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.190 
that's a higher graphics card processor
but<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.730> graphics<00:04:21.910> truly<00:04:22.420> are<00:04:22.570> not<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:23.050> much

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
but the graphics truly are not that much

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.540 
but the graphics truly are not that much
dramatic<00:04:23.770> i<00:04:23.890> mean<00:04:23.920> you<00:04:24.070> could<00:04:24.190> pick<00:04:24.340> up<00:04:24.430> a

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
dramatic i mean you could pick up a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.740 
dramatic i mean you could pick up a
little<00:04:24.670> detail<00:04:25.000> here<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.330> there<00:04:25.420> but<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
little detail here and there but it

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.630 
little detail here and there but it
isn't<00:04:26.110> something<00:04:26.290> that<00:04:26.530> you're<00:04:26.800> gonna<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.610> a

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
isn't something that you're gonna that a

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.700 
isn't something that you're gonna that a
Helen<00:04:28.270> Keller<00:04:28.480> will<00:04:28.690> notice<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.140> know<00:04:29.290> it's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
Helen Keller will notice you know it's

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.870 
Helen Keller will notice you know it's
not<00:04:29.890> huge<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.360> ps4<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:32.320> xbox<00:04:32.710> even<00:04:33.250> even

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
not huge so the ps4 the xbox even even

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.690 
not huge so the ps4 the xbox even even
more<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.510> because<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:35.440> xboxes<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.460> ps4

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
more so because the xboxes and the ps4

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.910 
more so because the xboxes and the ps4
we're<00:04:36.910> gonna<00:04:37.000> have<00:04:37.180> full<00:04:37.680> 1080p<00:04:38.680> quality

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
we're gonna have full 1080p quality

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.310 
we're gonna have full 1080p quality
while<00:04:39.310> these<00:04:39.490> only<00:04:39.700> have<00:04:39.880> like<00:04:40.030> 480p<00:04:40.420> some

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
while these only have like 480p some

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.540 
while these only have like 480p some
bullshit<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.740> mouth<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.310> stretches

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
bullshit of mouth and it just stretches

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.550 
bullshit of mouth and it just stretches
the<00:04:42.760> quality<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.610> once<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.390> that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the quality and so once you have that

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.540 
the quality and so once you have that
you<00:04:47.560> really<00:04:47.860> cannot<00:04:48.160> tell<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.520> difference

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
you really cannot tell the difference

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.760 
you really cannot tell the difference
whatsoever<00:04:49.390> unless<00:04:49.780> you're<00:04:50.080> good<00:04:50.260> enough<00:04:50.290> and

even though it's probably like a
