00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 depends on the personal project 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 has a specialization in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.050
 they will always 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.119
 contribute to greater knowledge 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 for the best quality of training 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.820
 then this obviously 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 will be valued and taken into account 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 at the time of recruitment of a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.440
 selection process and even a promotion 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.450
 in the then improvement it should be 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 a constant search of any 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.290
 professional 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.930
 whether this improvement will come 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.450
 work experience by contact 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.740
 with the field for the diversity of 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.850
 work experiences that the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.170
 professional qualification or qualification 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 through a course of one 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 postgraduate training of a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.189
 specialization training will depend on 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.229
 much of what is the personal project of this 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.049
 and what kind of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 work he chose to enter into 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.880
 some areas the day to day experience 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.790
 are important in the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.820
 initially in other areas 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.909
 it's time greater specialization 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 deepening in certain themes the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.290
 contents and the work technician are 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.909
 valued also from the beginning then 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.500
 it is necessary that the professional knows that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.080
 for example, the student is leaving the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.360
 university knows its field of 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.180
 work and what this field of work 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 needs and requires it so that it can 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.000
 seek a direct transition first 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 it is a work experience or already a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.880
 qualification greater an improvement a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.880
 deepening 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.920
 in graduate school always 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.259
 content analysis first 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.439
 there are already many 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 institutions offering courses in 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.160
 training . 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.700
 specialization also know the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.440
 differences between these different 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.510
 programs is important right 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 program content if it goes 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.769
 specifically address the interests of the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.230
 of the student in terms of learning 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.410
 technical and theoretical learning that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.090
 is contemplated there rather 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.420
 also fundamental to the formation of the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.200
 teacher who is responsible for 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 to administer these postgraduate courses 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.720
 as teachers have the experience and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.140
 training needed to add 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.810
 knowledge to increase the level of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.049
 training and the quality of training 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 student so often the quest ends 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.870
 being by time is not the flexibility 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.569
 of the hourly load by value is not that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.450
 these trainings charge but the two 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.000
 perhaps more important is the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 programmatic content exactly and 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.109
 faculty training I think this 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.340
 is a concern that any student of 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.340
 postgraduate course must have 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.340
 within the organization has 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.640
 including organizations that favor is 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.019
 this pursuit of specialization 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.150
 continuing education programs within 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:30.129
 companies or the program 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.220
 usually run until 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.470
 provide a flexibilization of the load 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.930
 for the professional to do this 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.090
 dinesh qualify look for a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.189
 improvement and this can be done 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.189
 within the organizations themselves with 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:48.459
 offer courses right of graduate 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.639
 improvement and in-house 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.620
 flexibilization and even in sponsoring 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.470
 courses made by its collaborators 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.510
 by its professionals outside 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.599
 university institutions or 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.359
 institutions in the university 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.150
 used to be a career differential 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.790
 always, how much more years of study? 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.849
 how much more dedication to the area of 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.150
 better professional training this logic 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.310
 a priori nÃ© but this choice she has to 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.440
 make sense within the project 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.130
 career people, do not we? 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 usually warn of the risk of 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.070
 curriculum even though the idea that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.500
 any title I have any 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.770
 The course I do will be important. 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.270
 going to be going to add to my project 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.030
 and this is not necessarily the case. 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.310
 in these bonds they have to be 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.460
 these courses it has to be thought of 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.380
 within an individual reflection of what 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.389
 I intend is that kind of 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.039
 knowledge I lack for work 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.949
 I work for the job I do. 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.650
 I intend to exercise in the future , that's when I 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.110
 I will specifically seek to contemplate 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.960
 these gaps, and get a 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.020
 knowledge a technical training that 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.630
 take care of my personal project, huh? 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.210
 The more sense you make for me. 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.099
 personal project for sure this better 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.099
 pro student is better for the worker
