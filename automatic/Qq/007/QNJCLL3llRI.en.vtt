00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.330
 and 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.270
 hello this is an order string and in general how 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.590
 now you've probably read that now 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 this is version 30 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.170
 but not because something is strong 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.479
 changed in general in our format but 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.280
 something has changed but I think it will 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.830
 more interesting dash will play us 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 some guitar players will play 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.060
 several different amplify music will 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.100
 more of my 3 holding will be smaller 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.140
 here but maybe 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.570
 well, one must do something to change and then 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 You already so clips more two hundred on neck 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.830
 clearing and it's time to go over 30 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.479
 we will start with 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.030
 tools that we had in 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.930
 previous version 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.910
 telecaster wwt korean production 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.270
 goal so beautiful with sensors de mars 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.430
 here is such a back made of mahogany 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.330
 the lungs are very and the main difference of this 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.310
 tool that it is very convenient 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.229
 there is really one of the most convenient 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.000
 for games tools that accounted for 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.310
 how to handle despite its 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.770
 in general, itâ€™s not a very high price 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.690
 so pretty like that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.240
 let's listen we listen to him i 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.299

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.369
 jetem 60 good classic marshal well 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:15.250
 right there with the river with two channels so 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.250
 that all joy can be felt 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.910

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.990
 but very yes of course it is not quite 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.270
 telecaster though 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.530
 The tool can clearly be seen thinking 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.380
 universal already in general 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.270
 repeatedly talked about it here and to 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.130
 the same is what I think the signals here 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.130
 worth pustule can play and everywhere 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.920

 there is enough urine and fat and other things 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.300

 imputed to the same in general 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:02.220
