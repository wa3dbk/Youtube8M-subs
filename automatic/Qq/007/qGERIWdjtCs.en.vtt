00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.730
 halli hello people welcome you at one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.070
 new video 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.429
 Today there is the unboxing of the apple 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 iphone 5 in white and that would be the 32 gb 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.039
 version 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 I have it now a few days ago 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.529
 Gravis ordered came within three 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.689
 days 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 and I can just praise gravis 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 that's just super fast going and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.439
 i call box the whole thing now 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 Let me know from the iphone 5 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.079
 here formed iphone 5 is the apple 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.850
 logo of five euros behind his passport 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.660
 do not actually do that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:56.550
 I'm interested in that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:56.969
 if you do it all the time, there it is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 open 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.049
 The lid is not very clear and here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 we have the wonderful iphone 5 in the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:14.100
 32gb version not at all times out fact 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 is the slightly cool the beautiful beautiful 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.909
 Part felix magath aside for us 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.430
 first take care of the packaging 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 content would be a small one 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.280
 wonderful booklet difficult to perform the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 then say a friendly hello 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.750
 then welcomed and stood hello iphone 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.549
 info 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.500
 and of course the wonderful apples 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 tickert the course may be missing 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 and then here we have the power supply that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.290
 very well known problems then the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.869
 new senior connector has now 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.869
 make this little connection short 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880
 this new connection 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.680
 At first one thought that not 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.840
 so good because it is so small in the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.119
 opposite to the 30 pin connector shows 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.610
 up times very briefly summed up the great one 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.180
 and you really pull it and it 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.209
 nothing happens 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.760
 since an already switches the times also 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.709
 handy if we have the apple i pods here 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 there comes an external video about how 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.060
 But I do not pack because they have 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:25.920
 I already okay then come yes accepted 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.810
 to the iphone itself in contrast to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.480
 iphone 4s and the predecessor versions 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.430
 it has now become longer and it 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 has become thinner the design has changed 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
 I think a little bit changed now 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.400
 but it is still on the iphone 4s 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 design ajar so then we come 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.920
 Mandy right here we have this 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 newsweek button here we have the loud 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
 arrival here the white lines 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.519
 are the antennas down here have the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.829
 3.5 millimeter jack connection 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.680
 microphone the lightning connector and 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.230
 here are the speakers here again two 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.650
 connectors antennas and here then the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.940
 sim-card sled and up here the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.310
 well-known power button then 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:21.780
 I would say I do the slides 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:23.019
 let's go and report the whole time 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.510
 German 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.980
 that smells as good as it gets 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.120
 By the way, my first iphone and I am 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.980
 really pretty happy Bangladesh 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.220
 We live in Bangladesh or that 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:48.519
 Part maybe grown in Germany 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 Next one could enter the password 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.109
 so password is now entered 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.139
 Of course, we are activating regulatory services 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.620
 then configure as a new iphone with 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.400
 sign in to apple id 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.400
 then we will continue 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.970
 accept yes we accept this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.760
 of course, everything through that the 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.239
 apple id but it should be the same 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.530
 be finished 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.950
 So I can give you a short what to 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.820
 iphone tell so there is that now 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.050
 iphone in white and aluminum or white 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.820
 and silver and then there are still in 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.430
 black and graphite there is then 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.230
 almost everything black plus this aluminum 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:40.270
 is so bluish and I like that 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:46.260
 not so iCloud use a cloud 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.260
 Use backup on my computer 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.530

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.380

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.650
 we are still waiting for the iphone 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.350
 By the way, also a new screen 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.020
 that it does not know what that now 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.440
 has many names in any case 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.100
 that's even more production and easy 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.060
 a much better display than that 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.940
 previous and so far I have to say 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.300

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.340
