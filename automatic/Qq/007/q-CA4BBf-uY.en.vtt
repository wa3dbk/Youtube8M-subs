00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.469
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.000
 watching this video and in this video here 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.710
 how the school needs 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.179
 Money, then we need 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.799
 solve some problems that people 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.779
 has here in our life 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.329
 so I decided to sell some equipment 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.210
 that I have here because I no longer use 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.939
 more or less for me these equipments 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.130
 here they have no use for them 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.300
 are in perfect working order 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.589
 still not yet 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.290
 the only lens is a problem is this 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:37.909
 2470 that 2.8 of that year she is in 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.670
 perfect condition on the lenses are 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.670
 perfect engine it all works 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.320
 right only his electronic contact 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.940
 is that of some problem he is giving 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.430
 this error 001 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.860
 but if you use the diaphragm in 2.8 it 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.299
 still working, it does not matter 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.280
 but this lens will need a 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.080
 concert right but anyway it 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.080
 is in perfect condition in the minds are 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.540

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.749

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:02.209

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.399
 this my camera of lycra 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.440
 that she is the most esteemed camera is 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.209
 What I have here is more like the people. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.330
 you really need money then 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.680
 nor do I have this attachment 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.790
 so sentimental the camera despite having 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.040
 a feeling of the camera 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.980
 This camera belonged to the father and she is 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.260
 with us since the late 70's 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.120
 More or less, it's also super good. 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.129
 She has a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.530
 side that the camera was on the shoulder one day 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.049
 she slipped and knocked aside the keno 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.090
 so it has that mark that on the side a 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.349
 founded dinho but that does not interfere in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.170
 Nothing, neither the camera is 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700
