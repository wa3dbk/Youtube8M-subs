well<00:00:02.659> I'm<00:00:03.659> at<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> crossroads<00:00:04.589> here<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.890> still

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
well I'm at a crossroads here I still

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.650 
well I'm at a crossroads here I still
don't<00:00:05.460> know<00:00:05.609> exactly<00:00:05.759> what's<00:00:06.390> wrong<00:00:06.600> with

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
don't know exactly what's wrong with

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.460 
don't know exactly what's wrong with
this<00:00:06.930> thing

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this thing

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.039 
this thing
so<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.519> took<00:00:08.639> off<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.059> clutch<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:11.929> pulled<00:00:12.929> it

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
so I took off the clutch and pulled it

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.629 
so I took off the clutch and pulled it
out<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.440> actually<00:00:13.620> didn't<00:00:13.950> take<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.340> apart

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
out I actually didn't take it all apart

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
out I actually didn't take it all apart
yet<00:00:14.849> or<00:00:14.969> anything<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.540> everything<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
yet or anything but everything in the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.790 
yet or anything but everything in the
clutch<00:00:17.039> actually<00:00:17.460> sounds<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.990> decent

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
clutch actually sounds to be in decent

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380 
clutch actually sounds to be in decent
shape<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.369> thought<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.789> gonna<00:00:20.910> hear<00:00:21.210> some

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
shape I thought I was gonna hear some

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
shape I thought I was gonna hear some
stuff<00:00:22.880> moving<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.539> whatnot<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
stuff moving around and whatnot but it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.160 
stuff moving around and whatnot but it
doesn't<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.580> nice<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.240> pretty

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
doesn't it's actually nice and pretty

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
doesn't it's actually nice and pretty
smooth<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.980> mean<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.060> bit<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
smooth I mean there is a little bit of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
smooth I mean there is a little bit of
play<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.230> kind<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.529> normal

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
play but I think that's kind of normal

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
play but I think that's kind of normal
it<00:00:32.070> doesn't<00:00:32.369> sound<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.700> anything's<00:00:33.120> loose

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it doesn't sound like anything's loose

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
it doesn't sound like anything's loose
or<00:00:34.070> rattling<00:00:35.070> around<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
or rattling around the way that it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.290 
or rattling around the way that it
shouldn't<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.370> clutch<00:00:38.670> seems<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
shouldn't be so the clutch seems to be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
shouldn't be so the clutch seems to be
fine<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.899> didn't<00:00:40.860> take<00:00:41.070> off<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.489> Center

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
fine I didn't take off that Center

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.930 
fine I didn't take off that Center
spline<00:00:42.120> yet<00:00:42.390> her<00:00:42.780> ass<00:00:42.989> inner<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:43.440> because

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.560 

because<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.350> pulls<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
because it just pulls right out so this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.889 
because it just pulls right out so this
piece<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.320> goes<00:00:52.920> directly<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
piece just goes directly in here like so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.319 
piece just goes directly in here like so
and<00:00:56.960> actually<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> even<00:00:58.550> just<00:00:59.550> made<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> back<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and actually I even just made it back in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
and actually I even just made it back in
so<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.800> pulls<00:01:02.039> straight<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so and it just pulls straight out so you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
so and it just pulls straight out so you
can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.119> take

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
can see it's on there now you know take

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
can see it's on there now you know take
it<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.170> take<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.630> pull<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> off

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it off you just take it and pull it off

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.429 
it off you just take it and pull it off
so<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so so I actually now don't think that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
so so I actually now don't think that
the<00:01:16.619> clutch<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> issue<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:18.630> something

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the clutch is the issue it's something

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.980 
the clutch is the issue it's something
else<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> still<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
else because now when I still have this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
back wheel propped up and I spin it now

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.740
