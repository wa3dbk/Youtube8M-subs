00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580 
room if I depth on minecraft and here is
a<00:01:56.939> fake<00:01:57.360> stairwell<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.469> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a fake stairwell as you can see you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.399 
a fake stairwell as you can see you
can't<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.240> can't<00:02:00.479> go<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.990> but

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
can't get up it you can't go down it but

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
can't get up it you can't go down it but
there<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> method<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.549> getting<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
there is a method for getting up to the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.880 
there is a method for getting up to the
tops<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.829> rather<00:02:06.590> damaging<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> eyes

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
tops just rather damaging to the eyes

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.090 
tops just rather damaging to the eyes
here<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.489> am<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.289> ledge

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
here is am a ledge

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.960 
here is am a ledge
so<00:02:11.730> let's<00:02:12.360> say<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.930> fort<00:02:13.140> did<00:02:13.320> get<00:02:13.530> em<00:02:13.970> like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so let's say the fort did get em like

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.450 
so let's say the fort did get em like
broken<00:02:15.270> into<00:02:15.630> by<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.080> skeletons<00:02:16.650> or<00:02:16.890> zombies

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
broken into by like skeletons or zombies

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.290

think<00:02:39.740> well<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.700> highest<00:02:42.030> structure<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.930> may

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
think well the highest structure it may

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.690 
think well the highest structure it may
not<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> highest<00:02:43.680> point<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.610> would

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
not be at the highest point that would

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.450 
not be at the highest point that would
be<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> treehouse<00:02:45.360> but<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> highest

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
be the treehouse but it's the highest

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.490 
be the treehouse but it's the highest
structure<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.060> bill<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> think<00:02:48.450> its<00:02:48.750> nine<00:02:49.110> point

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
structure I bill I think its nine point

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.070 
structure I bill I think its nine point
nine<00:02:49.770> blocks<00:02:50.550> when<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.030> count<00:02:51.270> knees<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> bit

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
nine blocks when you count knees a bit

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.610 
nine blocks when you count knees a bit
sup<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> top<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:56.780> yeah<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.220> quite<00:02:59.370> tall

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
sup the top here yeah so it's quite tall

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.830 
sup the top here yeah so it's quite tall
so<00:03:01.620> yeah<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.180> I've<00:03:03.360> got<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.630> show<00:03:03.690> you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
so yeah this is all I've got to show you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.600 
so yeah this is all I've got to show you
i<00:03:04.200> did<00:03:05.070> have<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:05.660> unfortunately<00:03:06.660> i<00:03:07.610> didn't

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
i did have more unfortunately i didn't

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.440 
i did have more unfortunately i didn't
capture<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.120> properly<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.970> next<00:03:12.240> project

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
capture it properly but the next project

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
capture it properly but the next project
i'm<00:03:13.020> thinking<00:03:13.890> along<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.460> lines<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.990> maybe<00:03:15.990> an

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
i'm thinking along the lines of maybe an

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.280 
i'm thinking along the lines of maybe an
underwater<00:03:17.370> base<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.530> lake<00:03:19.710> over<00:03:20.070> here<00:03:21.290> so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
underwater base in the lake over here so

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.860 
underwater base in the lake over here so
maybe<00:03:22.920> dig<00:03:23.640> down<00:03:23.880> make<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.450> glass<00:03:25.110> building<00:03:25.920> and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
maybe dig down make a glass building and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.010 
maybe dig down make a glass building and
maybe<00:03:27.870> lead<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.140> tunnel<00:03:28.500> back<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.040> house

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
maybe lead a tunnel back to the house

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.960 
maybe lead a tunnel back to the house
must<00:03:31.020> be<00:03:31.170> quite<00:03:31.380> cool<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.890> maybe<00:03:32.460> i<00:03:32.550> can<00:03:32.670> put

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
must be quite cool and maybe i can put

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
must be quite cool and maybe i can put
it<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.180> an<00:03:33.300> indirect<00:03:33.780> inter<00:03:34.140> connection

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
it as an indirect inter connection

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.350 
it as an indirect inter connection
between<00:03:35.420> house<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:38.310> fort<00:03:38.640> over<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
between house and the fort over here and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.760 
between house and the fort over here and
slowly<00:03:42.360> i<00:03:42.510> hope<00:03:42.720> i'm<00:03:42.990> going<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.200> start

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
slowly i hope i'm going to start

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.280 
slowly i hope i'm going to start
building<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.460> towards<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.200> around<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
building out towards the around the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.430 
building out towards the around the
other<00:03:46.410> landscape<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:48.720> i<00:03:48.750> said<00:03:48.900> i<00:03:49.200> can't

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440

something like an under an underground
city<00:04:09.990> or<00:04:12.530> floating<00:04:13.530> city<00:04:13.800> could<00:04:14.640> even<00:04:14.850> do<00:04:15.060> that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
city or floating city could even do that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.200

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
like a bird's nest on the top of the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.189 
like a bird's nest on the top of the
tree<00:04:30.479> house<00:04:32.780> what<00:04:33.780> would<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:33.990> guys<00:04:34.139> think
