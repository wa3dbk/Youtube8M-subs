00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
thunder was going to get back to the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
thunder was going to get back to the
finals<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.930> hard<00:01:40.140> pressed<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.470> find

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
finals you would be hard pressed to find

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
finals you would be hard pressed to find
anyone<00:01:40.979> who<00:01:41.280> felt<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> Thunder<00:01:42.210> didn't

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
anyone who felt like the Thunder didn't

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
anyone who felt like the Thunder didn't
take<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> step<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.520> hurt

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
take a step back and really hurt

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
take a step back and really hurt
themselves<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.509> terms<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> putting<00:01:45.990> them

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
themselves in terms of putting them

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.380 
themselves in terms of putting them
right<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> top<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> west<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
right there in the top of the west and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.410 
right there in the top of the west and
with<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> good<00:01:49.619> chance<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.070> beating<00:01:50.640> miami<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
with a good chance of beating miami this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
with a good chance of beating miami this
time<00:01:51.630> around<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.110> again<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
time around it again that is the the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
time around it again that is the the
matchup<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> final<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.680> but

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
matchup that we see in the final so but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
matchup that we see in the final so but
I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.969> was<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.299> sort<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I think that was just sort of the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
I think that was just sort of the
knee-jerk<00:01:57.990> reaction<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.250> people

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
knee-jerk reaction and now that people

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.789 
knee-jerk reaction and now that people
have<00:02:00.000> had<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> chance<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.780> digest<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.469> trade

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
have had a chance to digest this trade

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
have had a chance to digest this trade
and<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.790> Kevin<00:02:03.299> Martin

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and really get to know Kevin Martin

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.649 
and really get to know Kevin Martin
who's<00:02:04.290> been<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> big<00:02:04.770> part<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.060> trade<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
who's been a big part of that trade and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
who's been a big part of that trade and
the<00:02:06.750> integral<00:02:07.140> piece<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> Thunder<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.039> far

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the integral piece of the Thunder so far

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
the integral piece of the Thunder so far
this<00:02:08.399> season<00:02:08.599> 11<00:02:09.599> or<00:02:09.690> four<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.259> playing

winning and I

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350 
winning and I
people<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:14.310> there's<00:02:14.850> potential

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
people can see that there's potential

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.910 
people can see that there's potential
going<00:02:15.540> forward<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.290> soon<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.680> start

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
going forward and as soon as they start

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.530 
going forward and as soon as they start
to<00:02:17.010> iron<00:02:17.280> out<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> kinks<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.030> really

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to iron out the kinks and really

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
to iron out the kinks and really
establish<00:02:19.380> some<00:02:19.560> chemistry<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> second

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
establish some chemistry in that second

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.580 
establish some chemistry in that second
unit<00:02:20.820> things<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.420> okay<00:02:21.720> we're

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
unit things are going to be okay we're

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.380 
unit things are going to be okay we're
down<00:02:22.860> some<00:02:23.160> people<00:02:23.430> look<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.970> okc

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
be three pointers now this season I
don't<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:03.960> that's<00:03:04.170> such<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.710> good<00:03:04.860> thing

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
don't know if that's such a good thing

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.350 
don't know if that's such a good thing
you<00:03:05.310> don't<00:03:05.400> want<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.700> power<00:03:05.940> forward<00:03:06.240> out

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you don't want your power forward out

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360 
you don't want your power forward out
there<00:03:06.540> too<00:03:06.750> much<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:06.990> Serge<00:03:07.800> Ibaka<00:03:08.160> has

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
there too much but Serge Ibaka has

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.310 
there too much but Serge Ibaka has
really<00:03:08.580> developed<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.300> game<00:03:09.540> nicely<00:03:09.960> now

Kevin Martin and how important was that

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.900 
Kevin Martin and how important was that
in<00:03:18.810> terms<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.230> acclimating<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.340> team<00:03:20.610> and

two totally different players James

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.700 
two totally different players James
Harden<00:03:30.630> works<00:03:30.780> best<00:03:31.050> with<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> ball<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> his

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
Harden works best with the ball in his

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.800 
Harden works best with the ball in his
hands<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.370> pick<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.640> roll<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.240> Kevin

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
hands and that pick and roll and Kevin

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
hands and that pick and roll and Kevin
Martin<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.230> great<00:03:34.740> coming<00:03:35.040> off<00:03:35.160> screens<00:03:35.580> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
Martin is great coming off screens and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.250 
Martin is great coming off screens and
and<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.360> know<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.630> catching<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and you know really catching and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.070 
and you know really catching and
shooting<00:03:37.460> he's<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.490> very<00:03:38.640> good<00:03:39.090> option<00:03:39.270> on<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
shooting he's a very good option on the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.260 
shooting he's a very good option on the
wing<00:03:40.260> spotting<00:03:40.770> up<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.610> Russell<00:03:41.940> Westbrook

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
wing spotting up with Russell Westbrook

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.850 
wing spotting up with Russell Westbrook
and<00:03:42.390> Kevin<00:03:42.450> Durant<00:03:42.720> kicking<00:03:43.230> out<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.590> him<00:03:43.710> and

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and Kevin Durant kicking out to him and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740 
and Kevin Durant kicking out to him and
I<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:43.950> he's<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.520> in<00:03:44.880> some<00:03:45.420> ways<00:03:45.480> a

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
I think he's actually in some ways a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.930 
I think he's actually in some ways a
better<00:03:46.020> fit<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.040> Thunder<00:03:47.400> team<00:03:47.430> because

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
better fit for this Thunder team because

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.640 
better fit for this Thunder team because
you<00:03:48.030> already<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.420> Russell<00:03:49.080> Westbrook<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
you already have Russell Westbrook and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.070 
you already have Russell Westbrook and
Kevin<00:03:49.710> Durant<00:03:50.010> dominating<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> ball<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.900> now

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
Kevin Durant dominating the ball and now

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.960 
Kevin Durant dominating the ball and now
you<00:03:52.140> don't<00:03:52.320> have<00:03:52.440> James<00:03:52.830> Harden<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.340> third<00:03:53.730> guy

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
you don't have James Harden a third guy

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.880 
you don't have James Harden a third guy
dominating<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.960> ball<00:03:55.140> Kevin<00:03:55.500> Martin<00:03:55.710> can

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
dominating the ball Kevin Martin can

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.860 
dominating the ball Kevin Martin can
play<00:03:56.070> extremely<00:03:56.310> well<00:03:56.580> off<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.450> ball<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.810> I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
play extremely well off the ball and I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.940 
play extremely well off the ball and I
think<00:03:58.110> he's<00:03:58.260> done<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.470> great<00:03:58.620> job<00:03:58.740> of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
think he's done a great job of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.830 
think he's done a great job of
acclimating<00:03:59.610> himself<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.150> trying<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.420> fit<00:04:00.660> in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
acclimating himself and trying to fit in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.260 
acclimating himself and trying to fit in
really<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.800> best<00:04:02.010> as<00:04:02.130> he<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.430> well<00:04:02.970> Darnell

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
really as best as he can well Darnell

James Harden is and his style of play it

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.020 
James Harden is and his style of play it
actually<00:04:31.530> takes<00:04:32.040> away<00:04:32.370> from<00:04:32.430> what<00:04:32.640> they're

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
actually takes away from what they're

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.210 
actually takes away from what they're
able<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.450> do<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.930> kevin<00:04:34.860> martin's

complementary<00:04:36.090> play<00:04:36.420> really<00:04:37.020> allows<00:04:37.350> them<00:04:37.650> to

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
complementary play really allows them to

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.030 
complementary play really allows them to
showcase<00:04:38.250> more<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.610> their<00:04:38.790> skill<00:04:39.060> set<00:04:40.010> yeah<00:04:41.010> I

sister up his turnovers unfortunately
you're<00:04:51.030> still<00:04:51.240> up<00:04:51.420> but<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:52.290> know<00:04:52.380> they're

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you're still up but you know they're

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.160 
you're still up but you know they're
really<00:04:53.130> evolving<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.880> becoming<00:04:54.170> all-around

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
really evolving and becoming all-around

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.930 
really evolving and becoming all-around
players<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.920> when<00:04:56.160> they<00:04:56.280> do<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.730> think

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
players and when they do that I think

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.310 
players and when they do that I think
the<00:04:57.210> Thunder<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.570> really<00:04:57.870> at<00:04:57.960> its<00:04:58.080> best

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
the Thunder is really at its best

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.450 
the Thunder is really at its best
because<00:04:58.710> they're<00:04:58.860> not<00:04:58.920> only<00:04:59.190> are<00:04:59.310> they

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
because they're not only are they

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.490 
because they're not only are they
improving<00:05:00.420> their<00:05:00.570> own<00:05:00.750> games<00:05:01.110> but<00:05:01.380> they're

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
improving their own games but they're

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.680 
improving their own games but they're
getting<00:05:01.650> everyone<00:05:02.100> else<00:05:02.310> involved<00:05:02.670> more<00:05:03.060> and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
getting everyone else involved more and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.140 
getting everyone else involved more and
not<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:04.050> relying<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.740> great<00:05:05.520> efforts<00:05:06.000> by

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
not just relying on great efforts by

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.850 
not just relying on great efforts by
individual<00:05:06.810> players<00:05:07.110> which<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.590> what<00:05:07.740> they

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
individual players which is what they

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.650 
individual players which is what they
did<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> lot<00:05:08.400> last<00:05:08.430> year<00:05:08.820> in<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.060> finals<00:05:09.480> run

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
did a lot last year in that finals run

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.750 
did a lot last year in that finals run
so<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:10.140> think<00:05:10.440> they<00:05:10.740> could<00:05:10.980> like<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.340> said<00:05:11.580> be

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
so I think they could like you said be

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.090 
so I think they could like you said be
better<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.300> year<00:05:12.620> deep<00:05:13.620> into<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.920> playoffs

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
better this year deep into the playoffs

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800 
better this year deep into the playoffs
because<00:05:14.550> everyone<00:05:15.210> will<00:05:15.360> be<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:15.540> threat

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
because everyone will be a threat

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.110 
because everyone will be a threat
