the ground effect work done on it as you
can<00:00:13.620> see<00:00:14.780> right<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.230> did<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> little<00:00:17.340> patch

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
can see right here I did a little patch

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.349 
can see right here I did a little patch
work<00:00:17.970> had<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> little<00:00:18.810> crack<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.359> sanded

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
work had a little crack come so I sanded

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
work had a little crack come so I sanded
that<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.810> pulled<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> bad<00:00:23.160> pieces<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that down pulled out the bad pieces and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
that down pulled out the bad pieces and
repatched<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.930> I'll<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.140> wait<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
repatched it so I'll just wait for that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
repatched it so I'll just wait for that
to<00:00:25.800> dry<00:00:26.330> then<00:00:27.330> I'll<00:00:27.449> sand<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.900> down<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.730> put

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to dry then I'll sand that down and put

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.510 
to dry then I'll sand that down and put
the<00:00:29.849> black<00:00:30.029> primer<00:00:30.420> over<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.900> top<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.520> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the black primer over the top of that so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
the black primer over the top of that so
other<00:00:33.239> than<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.350> doesn't<00:00:34.680> look

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
other than that I think it doesn't look

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.790 
other than that I think it doesn't look
too<00:00:34.980> bad<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.870> guys<00:00:37.050> let<00:00:37.290> me<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640 

first<00:00:48.460> time<00:00:48.820> I've<00:00:49.030> ever<00:00:49.500> scratch-built

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
first time I've ever scratch-built

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.470 
first time I've ever scratch-built
ground<00:00:51.280> effects

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.910 

I<00:00:55.710> still<00:00:56.710> got<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:57.010> cut<00:00:57.220> out<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:59.290> holes<00:00:59.320> right

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
I still got to cut out the holes right

00:00:59.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
I still got to cut out the holes right
here<00:01:00.400> for<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.030> exhaust

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.199 

and<00:02:15.750> here's<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.500> motor

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:35.580 

I<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:22.340> did<00:02:22.549> box<00:02:22.879> stock<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> motor<00:02:25.000> special

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.280 

so<00:02:36.160> that's<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:36.550> I'm<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.540> um<00:02:37.630> see

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
so that's where I'm at on that um see

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.210 
so that's where I'm at on that um see
also<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.709> got<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:42.569> Pegasus<00:02:43.569> wheels<00:02:44.069> that's<00:02:45.069> what

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
also I got a Pegasus wheels that's what

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.120 
also I got a Pegasus wheels that's what
I'm<00:02:45.310> gonna<00:02:45.430> put<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.500> they<00:02:47.500> look<00:02:47.920> pretty

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
I'm gonna put on it they look pretty

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.920 
I'm gonna put on it they look pretty
good<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:51.120> actually<00:02:52.120> had<00:02:54.300> drill<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.480> hold<00:02:55.720> out<00:02:55.900> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
good I actually had drill to hold out a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.309 
good I actually had drill to hold out a
little<00:02:56.200> bigger<00:02:56.470> for<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.010> fit<00:02:57.220> on<00:03:01.319> like

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
little bigger for it to fit on like

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.000 
little bigger for it to fit on like
tread<00:03:02.709> pattern<00:03:03.130> are<00:03:03.250> nice<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.910> wide<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:08.010> really

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
tread pattern are nice and wide I really

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.920 
tread pattern are nice and wide I really
think<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:09.370> about<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:10.090> I'm<00:03:10.360> gonna<00:03:10.540> do<00:03:10.750> with

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
think that's about all I'm gonna do with

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.960 
think that's about all I'm gonna do with
this<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.040> ground<00:03:12.280> effects<00:03:12.730> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
this is just the ground effects and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.460 
this is just the ground effects and
these<00:03:13.090> wheels<00:03:14.700> let's<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.970> had<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:17.019> raise<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
these wheels let's I had to raise the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.790 
these wheels let's I had to raise the
rear<00:03:17.950> end<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.150> chassis<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:20.140> little

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
rear end on the chassis just a little

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.300 
rear end on the chassis just a little
bit<00:03:21.239> for<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.330> back<00:03:22.540> wheels<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.170> fit<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.160> I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
bit for the back wheels to fit and I

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.680 
bit for the back wheels to fit and I
actually<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.910> gives<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.209> away<00:03:25.300> better

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
actually think it gives it away better

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.340 
actually think it gives it away better
stance<00:03:26.400> than<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.610> original<00:03:28.120> because<00:03:28.360> on<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
stance than the original because on the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.199 
stance than the original because on the
original<00:03:29.830> stands<00:03:30.130> for<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.519> Mustang<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
original stands for this Mustang the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.479 
original stands for this Mustang the
back<00:03:31.450> end<00:03:31.720> kind<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.110> sits<00:03:32.350> low<00:03:32.620> looks<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
back end kind of sits low looks like the

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.090 
back end kind of sits low looks like the
front<00:03:33.730> ends<00:03:33.910> higher<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.530> way<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:35.890> kind

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
front ends higher and this way it kind

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.630 
front ends higher and this way it kind
of<00:03:36.190> levels<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.670> out<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:39.010> looks<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.310> lot<00:03:39.459> more

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
of levels it out so it looks a lot more

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.220 
of levels it out so it looks a lot more
streamlined<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.660> guess

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:04:06.559 

it's<00:03:45.230> kind<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.620> what<00:03:45.770> it'll<00:03:45.920> look<00:03:46.040> like

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.670 

that<00:04:07.569> looks<00:04:07.780> pretty<00:04:07.959> badass<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:11.349> that's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
that looks pretty badass but that's

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.130 
that looks pretty badass but that's
where<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.920> met<00:04:12.190> with<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.550> for<00:04:12.730> now<00:04:13.140> probably

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
where I met with it for now probably

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.310 
where I met with it for now probably
