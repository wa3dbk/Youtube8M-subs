00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
the easiest way to do it is just to open

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.990 
the easiest way to do it is just to open
up<00:01:11.390> Camtasia<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.440> hit<00:01:13.310> record<00:01:13.700> without

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
up Camtasia and hit record without

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.270 
up Camtasia and hit record without
recording<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> audio<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:15.979> on<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
recording the audio and then on the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.940 
recording the audio and then on the
countdown<00:01:16.610> once<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.180> goes<00:01:17.330> down<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.900> from<00:01:18.619> 3<00:01:18.830> to

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
countdown once it goes down to from 3 to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.620 
countdown once it goes down to from 3 to
0<00:01:19.189> right<00:01:19.610> when<00:01:19.760> it<00:01:19.850> goes<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.000> 0<00:01:20.299> just<00:01:20.510> hit

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
0 right when it goes to 0 just hit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.859 
0 right when it goes to 0 just hit
record<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.760> that'll<00:01:22.760> make<00:01:22.850> these<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.510> part

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
record and that'll make these this part

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.410 
record and that'll make these this part
much<00:01:24.170> easier<00:01:24.560> because<00:01:24.770> if<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.250> don't<00:01:25.460> then

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
much easier because if you don't then

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.710 
much easier because if you don't then
adult<00:01:26.840> City<00:01:27.080> cannot<00:01:27.380> open<00:01:27.710> up<00:01:27.830> videos<00:01:28.220> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.930 
highlight the part of your audio that
has<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.270> static<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.280> it'll<00:02:10.280> look<00:02:10.610> like

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
has the static in it and it'll look like

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.790 
has the static in it and it'll look like
the<00:02:11.209> same<00:02:11.480> exact<00:02:11.900> line<00:02:12.170> throughout<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> whole

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
the same exact line throughout the whole

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.290 
the same exact line throughout the whole
video<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.170> about<00:02:15.380> good<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
video so this is about good and I just

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.880 
video so this is about good and I just
want<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.080> want<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.350> have<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:18.800> guys

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
want to I just want to have you guys

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.500 
want to I just want to have you guys
notice<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:19.400> thick<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> lines<00:02:20.000> are<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.360> now

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
notice how thick the lines are right now

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.050 
notice how thick the lines are right now
because<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.900> means<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.650> noise<00:02:22.060> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
because that means there is noise and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.000 
because that means there is noise and
there<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> continuous<00:02:23.930> static<00:02:24.260> noise<00:02:24.440> so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
there is a continuous static noise so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.350 
there is a continuous static noise so
once<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.430> highlight<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> you're<00:02:26.180> going<00:02:26.300> to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
once you do highlight it you're going to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.449 
once you do highlight it you're going to
go<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> effects<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.709> then<00:02:28.190> you're<00:02:28.280> going<00:02:28.400> to

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
go to effects and then you're going to

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.070 
go to effects and then you're going to
come<00:02:28.820> down<00:02:28.850> here<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.239> noise<00:02:29.450> removal<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
come down here to noise removal and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.140 
come down here to noise removal and
you're<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.010> hit<00:02:31.160> get<00:02:31.430> noise<00:02:31.730> profile

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
you're going to hit get noise profile

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.020 
you're going to hit get noise profile
and<00:02:32.660> what<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.989> did<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.470> got<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.250> exact

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and what that did is that got the exact

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.150 
and what that did is that got the exact
noise<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.690> highlighted<00:02:36.470> part<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
noise that this highlighted part of the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.060 
noise that this highlighted part of the
video<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:37.820> however<00:02:38.510> my<00:02:39.350> highlighted<00:02:39.890> part

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
video or however my highlighted part

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.150 
video or however my highlighted part
looked<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.930> got<00:02:42.170> whatever<00:02:42.470> noise<00:02:42.769> was<00:02:43.010> in

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
looked it got whatever noise was in

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.220 
looked it got whatever noise was in
there<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.550> now<00:02:44.209> what<00:02:44.360> we're<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
there and now what we're going to do is

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.890 
there and now what we're going to do is
highlight<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.100> whole<00:02:46.310> video<00:02:46.519> go<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.390> effect

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
highlight the whole video go to effect

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.940 
highlight the whole video go to effect
noise<00:02:48.110> removal<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:49.100> go<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.120> less<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.950> remove

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
noise removal and go to less and remove

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
noise removal and go to less and remove
noise<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.510> see<00:02:53.690> those<00:02:53.900> lines
