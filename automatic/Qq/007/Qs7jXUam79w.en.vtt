00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you know all the you know roundup you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
you know all the you know roundup you
can<00:01:16.049> possibly<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.130> spray<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.000> your

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
can possibly you know spray on your

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.749 
can possibly you know spray on your
crops<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.020> what's<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
crops but what's really going on is

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.039 
crops but what's really going on is
those<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:23.479> spread<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> other

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
those are going to spread on to other

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
those are going to spread on to other
people's<00:01:25.500> farms<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:27.060> their

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
people's farms and that's what their

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
people's farms and that's what their
track<00:01:27.600> record<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.530> taking<00:01:29.159> control

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
track record is is taking control

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.810 
track record is is taking control
because<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.950> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> history<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
because if we look at the history of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.330 
because if we look at the history of
Monsanto<00:01:33.689> they're<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> chemical<00:01:35.100> company

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Monsanto they're a chemical company

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.020 
Monsanto they're a chemical company
their<00:01:36.060> job<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> sell<00:01:37.170> chemicals<00:01:38.040> okay

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
their job is to sell chemicals okay

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.319 
their job is to sell chemicals okay
their<00:01:39.299> job<00:01:39.860> they<00:01:40.860> sprayed<00:01:41.220> Agent<00:01:41.670> Orange<00:01:41.790> all

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
their job they sprayed Agent Orange all

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
their job they sprayed Agent Orange all
this<00:01:42.600> stuff<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.619> their<00:01:44.159> job<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> sell

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
this stuff that and their job is to sell

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.230 
this stuff that and their job is to sell
roundup<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.750> their<00:01:46.500> pesticides<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
roundup or their pesticides so if you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.749 
roundup or their pesticides so if you
use<00:01:49.140> their<00:01:49.409> seed<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.520> must<00:01:51.090> use<00:01:52.369> their<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
use their seed you must use their you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
use their seed you must use their you
have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> use<00:01:54.119> their<00:01:54.329> pesticide<00:01:54.869> because

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
have to use their pesticide because

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
have to use their pesticide because
their<00:01:55.380> pesticide<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> specifically<00:01:56.759> designed

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
their pesticide is specifically designed

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.289 
their pesticide is specifically designed
to<00:01:57.450> genetically<00:01:58.259> engineer<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.790> fit<00:02:00.060> correctly

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
to genetically engineer to fit correctly

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.410 
to genetically engineer to fit correctly
with<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> seed<00:02:01.380> right<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
with that seed right so so the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
with that seed right so so the
progression<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> chemical<00:02:04.979> company<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
progression of the chemical company to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.630 
progression of the chemical company to
sort<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> creating<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.439> frankenfoods<00:02:08.340> or

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
sort of creating these frankenfoods or

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.999 
sort of creating these frankenfoods or
these<00:02:08.819> seeds<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:10.140> they've<00:02:10.319> devised

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
these seeds that where they've devised

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.330 
these seeds that where they've devised
this<00:02:11.400> DNA<00:02:12.180> sequence<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.050> can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
this DNA sequence that they can

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
this DNA sequence that they can
patent<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.879> control<00:02:14.420> effectively<00:02:15.080> allows

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
patent and control effectively allows
