00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.260

 two pounds of beef liver 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.430
 and I'm also going to use 4 medium onions 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.760
 here and I cut them in julienne I will use 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.190
 2 garlic cloves and also cut 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.829
 slices 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:49.539
 I'm going to need 4 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.079
 I'm going to need salt and pepper 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.079
 freshly ground 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.019
 well these are the ingredients that I'm going 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 to use to prepare this liver 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.050
 encebollado so let's start what 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.180
 first thing we're going to do is heat the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.850
 pan and then we will add 2 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.220
 tablespoons of oil and then we're going to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.220
 sauté our onions 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 let's add the oil here I have a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.250
 tablespoon 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 and we add the second spoonful 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.490
 well our oil is already hot 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 Now let's add the onion 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.719
 and season with a little salt 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.780
 and well, so we continue to cook 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 onion 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.590
 well here it is already a little bit short 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.370
 to cook like I need it 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.370
 be a little softened not much fire 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.950
 I have it high up to number 8 so that 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.340
 be a little faster cooking 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.250
 the onion 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.160
 and well that does not take much time is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.519
 about three minutes to five minutes 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.430
 all for cooking the onion 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.860
 I have it in number 8 because it must 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.600
 have very high fire to cook it 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.420
 Quick 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.510
 and for less time we can injure more or 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.870
 less like three minutes to five minutes 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.990
 that's what it takes us to cook 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.250
 our onion and well this is already well 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.250
 that we are going to remove it 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.030
 well here we are going to add other 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.030
 two tablespoons of oil 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:13.629
 now we add the garlic 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.940
 well, this is nothing else, we're going to sauté it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.670
 a little bit and we are going to remove it is nothing 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.850
 more so that the taste of garlic in the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.690
 oil and give it a little more flavor 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.690
 to the liver 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.280
 well, so I'm going to pick it up here 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.530
 I have the garlic this remove it 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.329
 that we will not use it because nothing 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.780
 I needed the flavor to cook the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.780
 liver 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.240
 now we are going to add salt 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.030
 and add the freshly ground pepper 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.030
 Now we spin it for you 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.420
 put a little salt in the other 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.420
 side 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.210
 we season it with a little salt no 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.070
 a lot of salt so it does not come out very salty and 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.700
 we also put a little bit of 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.700
 Pepper 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.800
 now the temperature of the stove what 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.670
 go down to number 5 to leave 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.150
 cooking the liver little by little 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:37.630
 we need him to cook very well 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.850
 Well, I'm still cooking the liver 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.640
 as you can see here he is already grabbing 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.640
 color is already being adored a little 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.640
 well this is already so I'm going to 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.640
 remove 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.720
 and we do the same we add a 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.720
 little salt 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.060
 and we put pepper 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.419
 well right then, he already turns 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.419
 so that you can season it from the other side 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.069
 Well, I finished cooking the liver 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:39.000
 Now I'm going to add the onion here 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.000
 in this same container 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.170

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.170
 and then we mix everything 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.640
 and 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.620
