00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 2 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 it is 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.880
 roj 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.450
 we like that a lot with the Afghan people 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.660
 together with rick stulp 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 the particles 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.020
 a very nice vehicle is something in all shapes and sizes we come 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.140
 he sees them painted all over and milked out dressed up to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 that you also see them suffering in the Netherlands 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.080
 further on it blew 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 find it a lot of materials 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 and place water and fuel between different countries here in Afghanistan 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.990
 the this success there is also used for the hit but containers too 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.910
 We are very much busy with the empty containers too 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 collecting and pasting 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.620
 and as soon as we have to have more of then go for the goalkeeper 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.450
 Bet 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.370
 to send opera for those containers 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.100
 Quite a lot of fun to work together with Afghan people, the communication goes 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.050
 sometimes a bit difficult their goals want my hands and feet the these people 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.060
 driving around there 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.430
 yes I have been a few years before 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.500
 then 9 out of 10 times so they understand us, we can do ours 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 make it fairly standard 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.160
 we may occasionally become a real problem then we can find alternatives on the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.800
 baja make all and through the toppers understandable and they always come from and 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.470
 I think that's more fun to recruit with those people
