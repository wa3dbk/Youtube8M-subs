00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.420
 although there is today a great reputation 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.550
 we can highlight several types of all summer that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.599
 allows its scope of solutions 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.599
 the requirements that their policing needs 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.380
 the outcry that the fight was going to conclude 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.859
 it's about collecting a state in the state 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.650
 which allows an error in series 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.680
 to lose the fear of contact with her 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.900
 no matter what injuries may occur during training 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.580
 the outcry that our traditional fights 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.360
 these two hard enough words and six days that can withstand machete blows 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.370
 it is difficult to find 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 it must be treated before cutting it from the tree 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.319
 of the training summer 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.899
 indicated for competition in fights with 300 dead 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.230
 in order to produce no type of injury 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.290
 must also bring practitioners the author's father's contact 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 while acquiring the appropriate level of accuracy 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.240
 the outcry of the police 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.370
 deceased was specially created tailored to police needs 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.910
 so that it can be both subtle to allow 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.310
 luxury on the wrist 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 and incisive 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 to give the club a blow 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.520
 all of the techniques that make up the defense system of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.119
 fight 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.210
 with the bcs especially the summer 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.670
 have been scrupulously recorded they are currently being taught to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.470
 students 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.040
 that evolve according to the degree of coordination 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700
 dexterity and acquired mastery 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.820
 she particularly considers the following skills 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.710
 breathing 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.640
 moving blocking 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.860
 a lot of tone 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 skill in the center of summer
