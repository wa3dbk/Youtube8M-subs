 Yarmuk south of Damascus in early 2013 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 lived here 1 and 2 million 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.389
 Palestinians are now only 10 left 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.480
 percent paid for the war here 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.680
 high price all divided and brother 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.240
 trust a week ago about cupid and his 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 wife returned home 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.250
 ten long months they lived on the street 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 almost lost hope of returning 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 and that's what awaited them at home on the wall 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.340
 it is written we will return to kill you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.320
 bashar dropped tony bowls 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 whatever happens I'm not going to again 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.039
 leaving my house I want to break down the walls and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 build new 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 worse than now it will not be on 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.430
 throughout the whole year Syrian 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 Palestinians managed to stay in 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.180
 side of the conflict however 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.399
 interference by foreign soldiers 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.329
 determined and promised 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.030
 golden mountains 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.549
 made the people of yarmuk decide on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 whose side will they fight and raise 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.840
 weapons for those whom they knew their whole 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.100
 a life 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.240
 some of my friends are fighting on 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 enemy side 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.799
 they are no longer friends of me who kicked out 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 us from houses and destroyed them can not 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.040
 be our friends every day about 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 cupid leaves to fight them 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.360
 but before he leaves, he builds under the windows 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.939
 and barricades of furniture to protect 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.400
 your family from snipers life in these 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.250
 bullet-riddled walls are also dangerous 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 like outside when the head of the family 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.610
 his wife and children are leaving home 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 defenseless 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.530
 every time parting with despair in the sea 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 helps her husband get ready for another 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.939
 battle she knows he must go but 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.329
 always when her husband leaves 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.040
 the same question remains unanswered 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.409
 every time he says goodbye to me i 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.369
 think about whether he will return or not somehow 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.740
 times he was hurt 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.320
 then he did not return home I sought 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 him in a hospital for men like him and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.310
 women like me are many however few 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.929
 They returned with their families vermouth 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.180
 snipers are heard everywhere 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.870
 Abu the sea went blind in one eye and for 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.909
 got into it a fragment in the field however 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.609
 33-year-old man has no choice for him anymore 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.260
 nowhere to take your family and while the south 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.219
 part of yarmuk still controls 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.129
 action movies 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.049
 his house or what was left of it 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.420
 liberated by the Palestinians who are like 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.329
 Abu the sea is fighting on the Syrian side 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.129
 armies 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.379
 when i go fight i always think about 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.139
 I hope my family will return to them 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.819
 unscathed and take care of them I pray 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:49.689
 so that in the event of my death there 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.760
 nice people who would help them line 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.489
 front quite close in two 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.829
 blocks away from here and for abu sea ​​and his 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.219
 comrades war is getting closer to 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.930
 home 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.930
 every time they try 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.230
 secure the street for their families weapons 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.719
 against them often raises their neighbor friend 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.549
 or even brother floor slier 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.549
