last<00:02:57.280> season<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.760> wizard<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.930> both<00:02:59.260> my<00:02:59.500> guys

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
last season the wizard it's both my guys

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.620 
last season the wizard it's both my guys
and<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.750> spots<00:03:02.019> pretty<00:03:02.640> pretty<00:03:03.640> boss<00:03:03.880> he's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630

and so does rinse cycle because you know

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.080 
and so does rinse cycle because you know
that

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
it has a resistance to ice you get the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.250 
it has a resistance to ice you get the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
hard time not believing that rinse cycle

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.570 
hard time not believing that rinse cycle
is<00:03:20.739> part<00:03:21.629> okay<00:03:22.629> wait<00:03:22.810> hold<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.530> gotta<00:03:24.370> look

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
Rotom you know he has the changes to his

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.530 
Rotom you know he has the changes to his
typing<00:03:34.750> still<00:03:35.379> always<00:03:35.530> throws<00:03:35.980> me<00:03:36.010> off<00:03:36.540> it's

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
typing still always throws me off it's

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.270 
typing still always throws me off it's
still<00:03:37.780> hard<00:03:37.989> for<00:03:38.110> me<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.319> think<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:38.799> not

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
still hard for me to think that it's not

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.789 
still hard for me to think that it's not
part<00:03:39.670> ghost<00:03:39.970> type<00:03:40.180> anymore<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.049> it's<00:03:41.620> still

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
part ghost type anymore so it's still

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.470 
part ghost type anymore so it's still
weird<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.160> he<00:03:42.220> has<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.400> ghost-type<00:03:42.910> move<00:03:43.180> but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
weird that he has a ghost-type move but

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.970 
weird that he has a ghost-type move but
I<00:03:43.510> think<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:43.840> kind<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.049> nice<00:03:44.170> nice<00:03:44.680> little

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
I think it's kind of nice nice little

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.059 
I think it's kind of nice nice little
change<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:47.319> I'm<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.739> blabber<00:03:47.980> on

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.410 
here barely talking about the battle but
rinse<00:03:50.890> cycle<00:03:51.280> gets<00:03:51.670> out<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.819> Thunderbolt<00:03:52.269> but

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
rinse cycle gets out to Thunderbolt but

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.180 
rinse cycle gets out to Thunderbolt but
as<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.690> know<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.200> use<00:03:53.349> roost<00:03:53.709> then

as you know if you use roost then

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.009 
as you know if you use roost then
