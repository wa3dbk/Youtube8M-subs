what's up everybody this is a sanitary
one

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.480 

the<00:00:12.950> mussel<00:00:13.280> farms

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.029 
the mussel farms
this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> very<00:00:15.960> popular<00:00:16.500> brand<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this is a very popular brand so I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.580 
this is a very popular brand so I
decided<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> give<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.850> try<00:00:18.180> let's<00:00:19.170> open<00:00:19.349> up

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
decided to give it a try let's open up

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 
decided to give it a try let's open up
this<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.610> show<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
this first to show you what we got the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.650 
this first to show you what we got the
scooping<00:00:23.099> size<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.610> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.330> here

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
scooping size as you can see right here

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
scooping size as you can see right here
it<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.430> bigger<00:00:26.430> than<00:00:26.790> your<00:00:27.000> average<00:00:27.029> scoop

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it is bigger than your average scoop

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.070 
it is bigger than your average scoop
this<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.320> resembles<00:00:28.919> a<00:00:29.189> scooping<00:00:29.550> size

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
this actually resembles a scooping size

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
this actually resembles a scooping size
serving<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> protein<00:00:31.769> powder<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
serving for a protein powder so it's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310 
serving for a protein powder so it's
definitely<00:00:32.940> bigger

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
definitely bigger

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
definitely bigger
so<00:00:34.680> therefore<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.370> serving<00:00:35.730> size<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.480> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so therefore the serving size for this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.259 
so therefore the serving size for this
pre-workout<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.400> a<00:00:38.430> half<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.910> scoop<00:00:39.150> because

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
pre-workout is a half a scoop because

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.799 
pre-workout is a half a scoop because
it's<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.750> big<00:00:40.019> and<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> blue<00:00:42.360> arctic

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it's so big and this is the blue arctic

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's so big and this is the blue arctic
raspberry<00:00:43.290> flavor<00:00:43.620> I'll<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.519> into<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.989> taste

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
raspberry flavor I'll get into the taste

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.430 
raspberry flavor I'll get into the taste
in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.239> look<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.330> some<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:48.750> ingredients

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
in a bit look at some of the ingredients

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.539 
in a bit look at some of the ingredients
we<00:00:50.400> focus<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.269> here<00:00:51.479> I<00:00:52.220> can<00:00:53.220> just<00:00:53.250> get

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
we focus in right here I can just get

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.920 
we focus in right here I can just get
closer<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
closer in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
closer in
so<00:00:55.890> ingredients<00:00:56.790> wise<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.330> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so ingredients wise it's going to have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.950 
so ingredients wise it's going to have
your<00:00:57.900> standard<00:00:58.320> ingredients<00:00:58.890> found<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.309> most

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
your standard ingredients found in most

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.189 
your standard ingredients found in most
pre-workouts

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
pre-workouts

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.939

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
citrulline malate there's some creatine

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.640 
citrulline malate there's some creatine
BCAAs<00:01:08.010> l-arginine<00:01:09.110> glutamine<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.439> that

good stuff

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380 
good stuff
as<00:01:12.780> far<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.020> overall<00:01:13.650> effectiveness<00:01:14.280> I'd<00:01:15.180> give

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
as far as overall effectiveness I'd give

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
as far as overall effectiveness I'd give
it<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.720> solid<00:01:16.290> 8<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> 10<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it about a solid 8 out of 10 and this is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
it about a solid 8 out of 10 and this is
off<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.570> half<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.990> scoop<00:01:19.259> which<00:01:19.469> is<00:01:19.619> your

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
off of half a scoop which is your

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.969 
off of half a scoop which is your
standard<00:01:20.369> serving<00:01:20.759> size<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.530> pretty<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.710> bet

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
standard serving size I pretty much bet

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 
standard serving size I pretty much bet
with<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.159> scoop<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.969> were<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.149> take<00:01:24.270> entire

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with one scoop if I were to take entire

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
with one scoop if I were to take entire
scoop<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:25.109> would<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.350> me<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.710> Wired<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.640> know

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
scoop it would get me to Wired you know

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
scoop it would get me to Wired you know
so<00:01:27.179> I'm<00:01:27.869> definitely<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.289> gonna<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
so I'm definitely not gonna do that but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410 
so I'm definitely not gonna do that but
overall<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.759> happy<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.359> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
overall I'm pretty happy with the

overall I'm pretty happy with the
product<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.229> never<00:01:32.100> bump<00:01:32.429> up<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> dose<00:01:32.909> though

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
product I never bump up the dose though

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.209 
product I never bump up the dose though

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
if you're going to take pre-workout

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.069

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
two feeling nothing just means that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.209
