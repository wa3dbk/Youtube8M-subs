00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 what all guys and welcome back on which i 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 two on the server 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 today we want to tell you a little story 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.609
 not to do something a little different from 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 usually so if you see summer ad 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.670
 listening to them yes we will tell you the story 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 of two knights no2 beginners two 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 cyanotic blue principles precisely a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.170
 however these two principles are not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.570
 they had heard of a big guy 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 treasure no treasure name name warface 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.450
 warface a non-browser browser treasure in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.780
 france in the caste containing a 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.930
 browser that is hidden in the castle 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 evil of crytec the two principles yes 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 they approached the castle and after 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 pissed on the door because in short it is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 the principles are more and more written 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 they discovered this treasure actually 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.470
 was there and they could see it and when 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 they saw this tutorial less than that 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.729
 they were starting to vomit shit from all of them 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.500
 the parts all out 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.140
 I the curses they were pulling 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 when we saw the first thing that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.970
 the game shows you what it shows you 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.640
 at the beginning the tutorial and it is the first one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.890
 time in 29 years we do i 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.020
 game tutorial and we were wrong 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.020
 this time do it because my mom 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.909
 you have in our heart we have spoken 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.750
 some time ago we put down here 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.110
 in short, someone in those parts is 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.700
 that exploited the cryengine 3 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.590
 exploits an evil use in the way 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.950
 worst that could be done 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 practically the whole appeal to open the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 hands free game with no textures 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.899
 it seemed a bit taken up by the piranha boys 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.420
 never cod software sit Iranians 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.000
 I do not know the authors but we do 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 responsible authors guilty of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.709
 having made makeover we looked at each other 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.539
 face we said what the fuck there is 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.360
 this and it's not crytec they put us on 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.370
 however crytec name however the game has it 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.340
 made another because above all with the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.290
 cryengine 3 another asshole who creates us 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 a game of shit is not especially if 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.209
 it was crytec not possible 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.860
 fortunately us that whatever 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.040
 say we always go to the bottom of the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.049
 things that that if they say ok then 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.970
 we have overcome this bad impact 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.069
 start we apologized and vomited 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.230
 we went to play their game badly 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.519
 and we found that marilyn 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.739
 anyone the millionaire 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.900
 vidyo zoe boys is out of reach 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.730
 from the normal to be a browser game 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.680
 crytec it got in dance she started 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 in the game he said since they do 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.010
 all because I can't do it we want to 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.440
 make a cry like this instead of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.819
 earn hicks once when hicks 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.099
 over time it is right but crytec curves air 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.019
 and this is the result of you assholes 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.639
 that you crack the games because if there 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.189
 you bought now we could 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.139
 buy us a game finished at day one 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.849
 and so it is self-updating 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.499
 what did they want to do about it 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.209
 cai dean said we have the 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:18.799
 cryengine 3 no we do crisis though 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.540
 instead of putting on special powers 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.870
 so the aliens will be too 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.510
 ministers we put the sound fps on 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.700
 let us resign the m4 i ak 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.919
 the soldiers something they never use 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.359
 in conclusion 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.719
 going to see then on the card is a 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:38.000
 trivial military-style fps no 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.439
 with truly exceptional graphics though 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.989
 we are talking about a browser game 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.329
 we are not just talking about a homeland 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.239
 browser game therefore currently has 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.919
 passed even offensive combat yes 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.709
 because that unity was made these 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:55.010
 factors CryEngine 3 which is an act shores 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.500
 other years is slightly more expensive in 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.449
 yesterday's terms of resources from your PC 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.859
 in short it is not that we play with the portati 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.079
 up however however it is rather 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.069
 optimized to not be so heavy 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.049
 aggressive as can be an engine 3 and 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.389
 despite the first impact always a 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.620
 fps assholes you are where you shoot without 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.939
 do nothing more 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.729
 actually hiding from the office 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.159
 rather interesting rather co op 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.440
 also we will practically have to help 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.930
 example to climb over a wall to gods 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.440
 companions then before arriving at 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.080
 reach the summit then a roof 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.380
 we will have to somehow help to do 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.000
 climb our companion otherwise not 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.699
 we could do the thing he did to us 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.949
 very pleased that this gesture does not come 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.860
 executed or if so I like a key e 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.100
 your example there is some depth in 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.290
 more by setting position 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.030
 but there is one or two we can decide if 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.980
 help our partner to go up e 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.990
 we stay down or arrive at 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.450
 getting along with him his friends helps 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.130
 we too decide which animation 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.110
 do in case we help 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.030
 then we are talking about a game in 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.970
 closed beta so it is important 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.100
 reiterate we had this ass of 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.170
 re-entering the gravity of the beta proceeds 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.670
 of crytec then the game came out from 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.830
 very little we don't know if everyone 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.320
 will be able to access or would have been born in 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.330
 groups will close it we don't know 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.310
 we informed them of this one 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.550
 we can say that the game is cool 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.930
 seeing from the images the maps are 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.610
 they are structured in a certain way 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.930
 different ways you can choose 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:36.590
 different classes of sniper in short 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.490
 the usual girls with the usual ones 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.050
 actually added because of the modalities 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.530
 sniper against sniper in a species 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.770
 tower defense is true yes very pretty 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.020
 the problem is that we are there is one 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.880
 beta so some animations are done 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.590
 still with the ass on the optimization 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.990
 graphics are a shit ie you think that 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.420
 tucking the anti aliasing into the game 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.940
 start to show you double frame you do 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.230
 a bit of that the earth the cia the frames 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.480
 then there is also another thing to say 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.070
 boys compared to a stencil combat o 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.930
 any other browser we come here 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.060
 it's up to download and it's up to download 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.180
 also a nice policy at the beginning not 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.130
 we know 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.680
 we have no idea how many gigabytes he has 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 downloaded the game but think a lot 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.210
 unless they have been assaulted 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.240
 the servers, however, so much so that at the beginning 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.520
 when you w you have to install the game 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.500
 somewhere you don't know where you don't 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.729
 knows how to choose only the unit e 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.820
 this is something that is fundamentally 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.740
 seen a lot on the ass because you have to 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.669
 just know where to put things in yours 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.090
 computer 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.380
 and why put them in short 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.120
 sunflower 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.039
 we hope they are things that are things 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.169
 in short, they solve as soon as possible 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.270
 however it is extremely judgmental 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.090
 positive for this work tennis 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.039
 compliments acriter though crytec ma 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.639
 because you have tutorials done by 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.639
 piranha bytes
