00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:11.204
I did this video for non-brazilians who want to come to Brazil in the 2014 World Cup

00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:13.800
And in 2016 at Olympics.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.645
The first problem you'll face in Brazil is in the airports

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:24.077
It's very common brazilian airports to suffer from constant delays

00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:27.445
And when there's no luggage loss

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.312
And when finally you'll search for a taxi

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:36.515
You could wait in a long line for a long time waiting for a taxi

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:41.873
This, of course, if you don't suffer a terrorist attack at flight

00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:49.627
Because it was shown some time ago by TV, how it's easy to board guns at commercial flights in Brazil

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:55.830
I also would like to remember the survey from the Latin Trade magazine

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.658
Based on readers' opinion about which's the worst Latin American airport

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:04.854
And it's exactly the brazilian airport of Guarulhos

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:10.681
If you're unlucky to land in this airport, I wish you luck!

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:19.375
Concerning security, I'm almost sure there's a high probablity you'll be robbed in Brazil

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:22.806
Theft and robbery are common in Brazil

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:28.116
Don't rely on brazilian police, which isn't able to preventing these crimes

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:33.474
You can be robbed even on the beaches, the famous "arrastão"

00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:37.375
Where a large group of thieves take everything they find on their way

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:41.134
If you decide to travel to Rio de Janeiro city

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:46.962
Be careful with manholes. It can explode at any time and kill you!

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:50.204
If you wouldn't be killed by a stray bullet

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:56.126
Besides brazilians who insists on throwing garbage at sidewalks. Rude people.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:02:01.483
They don't care about the public space, streets, sidewalks...

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:09.849
Brazilians don't respect accessibility. If you depend on a wheelchair, you'll find difficult to move in Brazil

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.856
Accessibility in Brazil is almost zero

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:17.509
As a walker in Brazil, you'll risk yourself to be hit by a car

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:23.289
Since here drivers do not respect walkers, unlike developed countries

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:30.104
If you rent a car, you'll have to face the famous "squeegee men"

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:41.242
They want to look after your car to avoid robbery and ask money for this "service"

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:46.082
If you deny the service, you'll risk yourself to find your car damaged

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:52.803
The public transport is expensive and one of the worst services of the planet

00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:56.609
In São Paulo, the bus ticket costs almost US$ 2!

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.839
And if you're woman and choose the subway, be careful!

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.713
You can suffer from an attempted rape or be raped, as it happened recently

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:11.977
In Brazil, the law doesn't mean anything in practice. Nobody respects the law in this country

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:20.201
One of the most wanted thieves of the world, called "Paulo Maluf" was elected federal deputy

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:26.311
And he still wants to apply for the 2012 ellections as mayor of São Paulo

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:35.475
Besides being wanted by INTERPOL. He would be in jail in any country, except Brazil!

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.778
It's how the law "works" in Brazil!

00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:44.874
Not counting the greatest villain of Brasil, José Sarney, which is president of the Senate

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:50.043
And the most corrupt brazilian party (PT) is 8 years in federal government

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:54.367
and it will govern Brazil until 2014 at least...

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:59.631
To sum up: impunity is the rule and corruption is the law!

00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:04.424
14 millions of brazilians are illiterate

00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:11.145
If you join them with 68% of population which is "functional illiterate"

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:20.497
75% of brazilians doesn't fully domminate reading, writing and basic math.

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:28.298
Only 25% of brazilians can be considered fully literate!

00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:29.708
Being optimistic!

00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:33.749
Besides that 17 millions of brazilians are miserable

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.107
And half of brazilian cities don't even have sanitation

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:43.290
Someone will say the World Cup was done in South Africa

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.339
But I remember you that South Africa is 8 times smaller than Brazil

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.569
And a population 4 times smaller than Brazil

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:02.323
Not counting the several problems occured in the South Africa World Cup, so you can imagine Brazil in 2014...

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:10.876
I also want to warn you that 92% of homicides in Brazil are not solved

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:15.482
So if you're unlucky to die in Brazil

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:20.369
Your family don't need to wait for investigation because police will not find the killer

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.398
And pay attention to the fact I live in São Paulo, the most important brazilian city

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:31.977
If you want to visit São Paulo, you'll need lots of money, because SP is one of the most expensive cities of the world

00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:37.288
And after all, if you really want to watch the World Cup in Brazil

00:05:37.388 --> 00:05:41.517
I wish you good luck because you'll surely need it
