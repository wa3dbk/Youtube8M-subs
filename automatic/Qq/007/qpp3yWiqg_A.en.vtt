00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.929
 well and now we talk about so 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 called children warrior or move it 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.690
 this type of running again refers to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.010
 psychophysical type of study 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.050
 the body from the consciousness of all that is my 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 but said interaction with environmental 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 wednesday what are the main points that is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.260
 this can be done at any time of the day 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.930
 you can even do it at night first 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.050
 add so here with your palms here 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 so here is my bucket this about 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.010
 stage body a little lean 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 forward 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 spine smooth head exactly i.e. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.030
 Ira focus on the points 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 roughly but we recommend somewhere 2 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 meters from yourself can be somewhere further up 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.130
 horizon and when you run a little bit 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.470
 bend your knees as much as possible 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.960
 lift up you land on 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 socks raise 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.729
 over time you will learn so choose 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 answer here what terrain 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.880
 difficult enough yes what myself 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.520
 with a focused look you will 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.490
 run and will not even stumble then 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.150
 feel every point every heap 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 each stick is a pebble but you donâ€™t 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.140
 will see put them on feel 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000
 exactly nipple ethereal look it 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.320
 quite an interesting exercise which 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.440
 applied in various 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.840
 combat including aspen system 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.770
 ninja send 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.270
 or there Indians 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.380
 good enough practice for 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.540
 study 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.320
 both your physical body and 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.690
 nerves of his system as if strengthening it 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.380
 opportunities and feelings surrounding 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.640
 space and circumstances which 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.039
 very important besides some skills 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 Here is the principle try very interesting and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.140
