was<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:22.260> than<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.680> expected<00:02:23.280> initially<00:02:23.760> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
was more than we expected initially of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.539 
was more than we expected initially of
course<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:24.299> were<00:02:24.510> skeptical<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.680> think

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
course we were skeptical I think

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.430 
course we were skeptical I think
naturally<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
naturally you would be with with that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.009 
naturally you would be with with that
kind<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.769> money<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.250> huge<00:02:29.580> decision<00:02:30.019> but

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
kind of money it's a huge decision but

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.720 
kind of money it's a huge decision but
after<00:02:31.200> seeing<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.069> quality<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.610> the
