00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 video I'll do the comparison 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.330
 between the armed pickup that is at 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.740
 left so the white vehicle is 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.469
 the equivalent of the rebel karin but 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.880
 armed with the insurgent pickup that gets 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 find on the right which is the equivalent 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.220
 urgent but armed, so there we 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.660
 start with a race necessarily it's 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.039
 vehicles to caderousse so like 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.490
 usually we start with the most 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.020
 quick 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.240
 so we have the impression that the most 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.400
 fast this is the pickup armed so who 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 is on the left but in reality it's 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.990
 the opposite is what is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 on the right the fastest is simply 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.469
 an effect we have with respect to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.910
 landscapes that scroll so there we arrive 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.610
 at the end of the runway we can see that the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.280
 insurgent pickup arrives first and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 the armed pickup arrive just behind 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.850
 so there the insurgent pickup are gaining 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 a point 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 we now go to arms 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.190
 so we'll shoot at the same time on the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.379
 same vehicle 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 so it's a flying vehicle is that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 it has an importance maybe so there 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 they exploded almost at the same time 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.750
 and is virtually point-blank end 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.260
 so we can say that there they have the same 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 power 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.510
 we do the same test on a vehicle to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 four wheels 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 so here we see that the pickup 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.590
 insurgent destroys the vehicle in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.750
 first so we could believe that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.850
 insurgent pickup tears and more 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 powerful 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 there we will do the same test but on a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.869
 helicopter that is still 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.270
 far enough so the device they have 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.549
 exploded almost at the same time so I 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 think about weapons 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.840
 almost the same thing now will test 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 resistance 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 Therefore there yet the gripper peak 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.180
 urgency always has one more point to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.920
 level of resistance 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.869
 we go to the peak but it exploded 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.100
 quickly done while the pic painted on 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.680
 nice does it you still have to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.659
 many more balls so there like 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 you see that already makes a lot of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 balls that are put on it and it's even 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.540
 more than a thousand this time since 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.369
 we are going to reach the 1000 here it is 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.229
 donated it takes more and more 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.180
 will end up exploding anyway 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.759
 therefore the urgent gripper peak is 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.680
 much stronger than the peak at 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.940
 share but suddenly we will move to a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.350
 other test 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.700
 so it's the same at the level of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.470
 resistance but this time with some 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.290
 explosive so there as you knew 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.120
 the pickup truck armed in the destroyed with a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 only explosive while the pickup 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
 insurgent him he's gonna have him here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.200
 three requests 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.330
 so that's okay anyway it's 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.240
 3d times these eighty it varies in 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 depending on where you shoot so 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 here it is destroyed then on this 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 test we can say that the pickup 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.320
 insurgents just wins this test 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.380
 he is more resistant he goes faster 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.680
 also at the level of weapons is the same 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.930
 thing 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.520
 so low shot to choose is better 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 take the insurgent pickup I do 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.630
 still a little ride on the prices the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.370
 insurgent pickups well here's a million 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.640
 three hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.950
 expensive 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.660
 on the other hand the armed pickup 950 thousand 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.630
 dollars gta it's just theft 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.950
 the rebel karine costs him $ 3,000 so 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.960
 that means you pay tears that has 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.820
 behind 947 thousand dollars 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.440
 that's all for this test it's all for 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.680
 this video and I tell you everything at 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.310
 time 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 ciao
