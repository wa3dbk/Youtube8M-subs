00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 meanwhile, it was a match 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
 played soccer and not kicked then 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.630
 how much you can play you see some 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.240
 positive things about negative things but the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.800
 result does not count anything I say football 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.869
 I don't know you in August so it's like the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.439
 result is not worth the performance 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.119
 it seems to me that until I ask for venia 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 we were team we created 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.420
 eight nine goal scoring balls clear phrasing 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.030
 dribble distribution even too much 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 so maybe I saw that things 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.129
 positive and things to work on 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.149
 and improve but a team totally 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 new young perhaps the youngest in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.789
 absolute but I think we are working 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.570
 well we are on the right track and some 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.239
 important attackers himself but you know 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.090
 how much is a striker makes goals 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.700
 the striker to say for the goal 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 however regardless of the goal I think yes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.040
 they are well moved 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 run I think that if we discuss choruses, that is 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 we certainly need to improve 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.070
 in all respects, however, I think that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.260
 a team that plays soccer 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.240
 a team built to play with 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.270
 setters in the middle of the field indeed 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.710
 maybe we're playing too much right now 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.600
 I would say little verticalize I have seen 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.990
 of the positive things I've seen things 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.660
 negative ie result does not count for anything 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 certainly today we saw each other again and win like this 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:43.119
 however, it expands on the plant 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.830
 defensive dispute the performance 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.229
 of the performance of Lazio 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.330
 thinks ill fly over but I do not singles 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.740
 I speak a team altogether I think 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.690
 who did very well on the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.210
 second balls on the aggression phase 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.280
 no we played very high pressure 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.710
 very often from behind even with the goalkeeper 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.259
 no thing we didn't do last year 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.300
 because I would like to answer so many 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.070
 football phenomena you can talk about 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.470
 very easy i think a coach 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 good and I'm not must optimize 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.540
 what he has available 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.730
 so if one wants a cook to do it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.739
 the nurse thinks it's hard work too 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.959
 if both are dressed in white no 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.959
 maybe based on what one is looking for 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.850
 to optimize last year was played 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.790
 in a way this year it was played in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.049
 differently because we have organ 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.640
 different tactical arguments in 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.030
 how we have different interpreters 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.730
 here are two without the championship instead 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.380
 to positive notes where he wants to see 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.150
 improvements on what focuses 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.400
 in fact making a team must improve 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.140
 on all the departments I am a surveyor of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.079
 doubt we have any difficulty in the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.430
 pre stage on preventive when 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.579
 we attack others maybe we do 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.610
 some mistakes because we work often 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.070
 in the shade area and sometimes in front 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.209
 to the support instead of staying behind 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.090
 at the back this is one of the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.819
 Arguments maybe we keep a little 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.620
 still the line does not verticalize 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.959
 very quickly when 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.760
 let's make negative transition though 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.909
 this is also part of the transition 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.349
 positive I ask, but this is a part 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.810
 also that we are not very well yet 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.879
 on the legs, however, I mean I think that 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.280
 a school that plays soccer like 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.379
 team that builds a team that 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.290
 I hope it will entertain the public e 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.079
 keep the goal prefixed that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.609
 I make two infantino and bernardini names 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.500
 who came out were al 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.349
 what is the market of the art of seeing 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.810
 how close they are to the rity and benedini 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.310
 and we took a 97 for the beretti 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.949
 advertised throughout Europe that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.299
 they know less is a 97 is aggregated 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.000
 in the caps I read it in the newspapers 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.549
 I don't even know who he is then I asked is 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.120
 a boy from the infantino cap does not 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.859
 it is the profile that interests us therefore 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 I'm still looking for a striker 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.879
 yes we are looking for a striker e 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.590
 to also complete the under or department 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.590
 the battery under as you prefer
