hen we were so excited we forgot to take
the<00:02:28.780> batteries<00:02:29.200> out<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.560> missed<00:02:29.800> qualifying

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the batteries out we missed qualifying

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.280 
the batteries out we missed qualifying
by<00:02:30.640> about<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.330> second<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.410> half<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:35.230> was

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
by about a second and a half and it was

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.199 
by about a second and a half and it was
too<00:02:35.530> late<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.400> anything<00:02:36.520> about<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.880> but

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
too late to do anything about it but

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.990 
too late to do anything about it but
then<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.050> next<00:02:38.350> race<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.980> Sparky<00:02:39.550> came<00:02:39.760> to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
was petit Lamaze the first petit who was

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.110 
was petit Lamaze the first petit who was
and<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.270> one<00:02:43.450> its<00:02:43.630> class<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.800> spent<00:02:45.280> 20<00:02:46.090> minutes

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and at one its class it spent 20 minutes

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.840 
and at one its class it spent 20 minutes
in<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.750> pits<00:02:47.110> with<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.410> broken<00:02:47.970> suspension<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
in the pits with a broken suspension and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.690 
in the pits with a broken suspension and
we<00:02:51.850> were<00:02:52.090> really<00:02:52.870> enthused<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:54.250> went

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
we were really enthused and I went

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.840 
we were really enthused and I went
around<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:55.239> see<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:56.850> manufacturers

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
around to see the manufacturers

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.960 
around to see the manufacturers
automobile<00:02:58.630> manufacturers<00:02:59.440> with<00:02:59.739> this

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
automobile manufacturers with this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.400 
automobile manufacturers with this
concept<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.150> we<00:03:01.300> could<00:03:01.480> prove<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:01.840> a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
concept that we could prove that a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.050 
concept that we could prove that a
hybrid<00:03:02.890> could<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.610> perform<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.940> know

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
hybrid could really perform and you know

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.920 
hybrid could really perform and you know
could<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> basis<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.480> hybrid

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
could on the basis of the of the hybrid

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.250 
could on the basis of the of the hybrid
and<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.170> electric<00:03:11.860> motor<00:03:12.720> had<00:03:13.720> joined<00:03:14.080> with

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
and the electric motor had joined with

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.900 
and the electric motor had joined with
the<00:03:14.590> gasoline<00:03:15.130> motor<00:03:15.370> could<00:03:15.940> win<00:03:16.180> races<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the gasoline motor could win races and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.910 
the gasoline motor could win races and
haryana<00:03:18.910> talked<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.300> Holman<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.780> 1998<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.590> can

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.570 
tell you none of the OEMs or the
manufacturers<00:03:24.160> were<00:03:24.310> interested<00:03:24.910> in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
manufacturers were interested in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.589 
manufacturers were interested in
building<00:03:27.580> either

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
building either

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.149 
building either
and<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.700> wasn't<00:03:30.939> until<00:03:31.390> about<00:03:31.980> six<00:03:32.980> or

and so it wasn't until about six or

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.979 
and so it wasn't until about six or
seven<00:03:33.489> years<00:03:33.730> ago<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.239> hybrid<00:03:34.480> really

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
seven years ago that hybrid really

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.339 
seven years ago that hybrid really
started<00:03:35.379> becoming<00:03:36.870> something<00:03:37.870> everybody

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
started becoming something everybody

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.550 
started becoming something everybody
wanted<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.650> talk<00:03:38.889> about<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.519> at<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.819> time

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
wanted to talk about but at that time

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.789 
wanted to talk about but at that time
