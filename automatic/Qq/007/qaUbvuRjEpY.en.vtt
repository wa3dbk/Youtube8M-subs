talked<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> speed<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.110> he<00:01:25.170> gets<00:01:25.439> when

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
talked about the speed that he gets when

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.690 
talked about the speed that he gets when
he<00:01:25.650> comes<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.130> southern<00:01:26.369> ice<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
he comes up through southern ice and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
he comes up through southern ice and
when<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.909> puck<00:01:27.060> comes<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> him<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.350> he

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
when that puck comes to him you know he

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.039 
when that puck comes to him you know he
tends<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.009> weave<00:01:29.189> his<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.340> towards<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> net

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
tends to weave his way towards the net

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
tends to weave his way towards the net
almost<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.229> agile<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
almost in an agile kind of way so I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
almost in an agile kind of way so I
think<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.299> credit<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> goal<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.380> him<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
think we can credit that goal to him on

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
think we can credit that goal to him on
his<00:01:34.770> own<00:01:34.829> definitely<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.270> whole<00:01:36.750> team<00:01:36.930> really

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
his own definitely the whole team really

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.359 
his own definitely the whole team really
didn't<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> great<00:01:37.770> game<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
didn't have a great game and I think the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
didn't have a great game and I think the
hit<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> second<00:01:39.030> period<00:01:39.090> gave<00:01:39.360> them<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> lot

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
hit in the second period gave them a lot

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.060 
hit in the second period gave them a lot
of<00:01:39.750> momentum<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> fights<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.860> did

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
of momentum and the fights that we did

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.960 
of momentum and the fights that we did
see<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.549> something<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
see and that's something that really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
see and that's something that really
does<00:01:42.210> benefit<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> Royals<00:01:42.990> normally<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
does benefit the Royals normally in the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.499

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
the hit so I can't necessarily have a
