 Hello Lollipop Crochet by Bemochi 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.640
 Today's topic is about starting to knit on the base chain. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.000
 There are 3 ways to place the needle into the position of the chain. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 Each method has a slightly different job. 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.000
 Start with the chain structure 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.360
 If viewed from the front of the chain, 1 chain consists of 2 strands of silk. 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 This is called the front loop. 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 This line is called the back loop. 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.680
 Enough to return the work Will see a button 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 Called the back button 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.200
 Starting to knit on the base chain can be done in 3 ways. 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:40.900
 Type 1 spike the needle under the back loop and the back button 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.300
 Will get 2 rings like this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.120
 The work that came out would be like this. The base will bend out. 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.240
 Due to the tight base 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.760
 Method 2 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.280
 Pierce the needle under the loop after a single loop 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 The work will be more loose than the first method. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.540
 The last form, piercing the needle under the back button alone 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 By turning the work piece 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 Then thrust the needle under the back button 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.760
 This method also has a base that is not curved. Because the job is not tight 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 But different from Method 2 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.440
 This method has a chain that is similar to the top. 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.820
 But rather more difficult than the other two methods 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.880
 When knitting must choose one of the methods Do not knit all the patterns on the base chain. 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180
 Thank you for watching. 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 Crochet anyone can do
