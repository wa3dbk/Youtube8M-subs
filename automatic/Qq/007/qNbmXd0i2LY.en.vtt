00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.289
 good as you read on twitter and 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.150
 together we think it went up install because 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.129
 We have made photos on facebook or we have not 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.160
 raised one but because we were already old 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.740
 We have not moved out of the apartment but because the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.470
 another floor because the rent at the end 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.119
 they went up a lot and good more 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.099
 decided to move and then move in 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 this floor we have a problem we 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:36.040
 we see that we can not because it comes 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.560
 disappeared yes and apart that they have 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.330
 uploaded but it 's a very problem 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.710
 big 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.710
 but we do not know where it is we want here 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.160
 everywhere under the bed in 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.560
 a suitcase in a lot of places and it's 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.630
 that does not appear is a pretty situation 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.840
 frame because I had never been lost 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 a person person know never and where 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.500
 we do not know raises is that he had 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.509
 dead but carlos sobera would have hurt 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.170
 because I'm going to eat it all, it smells in a 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:11.230
 heap but not a lot of good a lot 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.360
 of dead sometimes a dead person for that reason 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.960
 total that in the end we thought that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.440
 same with the move 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.510
 in one of the accommodated boxes that measures 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.170
 is high to enter a box and the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 definitive 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.720
 where the mystery will be 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 take care take care in where is 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.020
 kevin kevin are you there is not there 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.600
 how good they do not fit 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.310
 the things that without kevin we do not know how to do 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.110
 nothing because basically he cooked the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.640
 that cleaned the one that did not massage that we 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.370
 It was the one that made us see that no 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.790
 cleaned those that did not help us much in 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.050
 home and we do not know what to do 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 over 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.860
 We do not know what to do because not because 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.510
 you do not know what 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.990
 if this happens before then it is 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.980
 series on top of the society that arrives on 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.030
 last chapter that remains and is lost 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.190
 age grace that I do not have to come not 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.790
 it's always going to be the last chapter as 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.590
 to close a plot of a series that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
 have not had points felt during 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.320
 all its emission then we will be able to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.970
 when we go as kevin has been lost 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.970
 but that has really been lost but 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:14.780
 that we live together that we do and 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.780
 we do well then 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.730
 juanma from below 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.910
 I saw the pan has broken it's broken it's not going 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.220
 is that they do not even go to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.220
 to last 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.870
 Hello 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.700
 it concludes that without 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.740
 kevin we are going to die because no 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.400
 we know how to do what we are going to die 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.370
 We really die 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.980
 already to close the final series as a final 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.440
 alternative of this follow as no 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.230
 series ends with a death or nothing 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.970
 of that but let's go in two days we're going to 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.950
 No we die we will record 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.569
 because it was too much for what we say that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.569
 I have decided 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.919
 five days with me and has also given the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.100
 yes I want a fool look that I told the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.350
 kitchen and we started hiding and juanma 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.630
 of the room or beds that we started 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.870
 match or yes yes yes for nothing that 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.940
 also operated that they are slow and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.919
 lately we have a lot of noise 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.840
 but very little and it seems that they are 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:49.300
 move or something that is looking for me 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:49.300
 very timidly and not so much because 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.380
 the ground either 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.380
 the happenings 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.650
 Well, look at 25 things for great things 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.750
 that without seeing I do not know how to maintain because 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.290
 they claim that he cooked that cleaned the 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.290
 massage 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.229
 heap of dead have died so 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.689
 we do not know we also get to the 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.689
 conclusion that as with plaster
