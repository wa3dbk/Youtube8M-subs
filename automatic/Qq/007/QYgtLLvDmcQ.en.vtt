00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
do that very fast so let's see you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.760 
do that very fast so let's see you
rolling<00:01:32.270> that's<00:01:32.870> actually<00:01:33.320> pretty<00:01:33.560> close

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
rolling that's actually pretty close

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.300 
rolling that's actually pretty close
that<00:01:34.010> one<00:01:34.100> was<00:01:34.250> actually<00:01:34.370> pretty<00:01:34.760> close<00:01:36.310> but

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
that one was actually pretty close but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130 
that one was actually pretty close but
again<00:01:37.550> it's<00:01:37.790> still<00:01:38.120> interesting<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:38.990> as

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
again it's still interesting like as

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.960 
again it's still interesting like as
soon<00:01:39.290> as<00:01:39.410> you<00:01:39.530> start<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.980> move<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.490> little<00:01:40.790> bit

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
soon as you start to move a little bit

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.630 
soon as you start to move a little bit
you're<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.930> popping<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.590> board<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.160> flat

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
you're not popping the board so flat

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.670 
you're not popping the board so flat
like<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.150> are<00:01:44.300> in<00:01:44.450> your<00:01:44.480> practice<00:01:45.050> step<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.440> it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
like you are in your practice step it it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
like you are in your practice step it it
starts<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.160> go<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.610> up<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.150> down<00:01:48.340> hmm<00:01:49.340> I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
starts to go more up and down hmm I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.190 
starts to go more up and down hmm I
think<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.120> just<00:01:50.180> need<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.480> take<00:01:50.780> your<00:01:50.930> time<00:01:51.140> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
think you just need to take your time a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.950 
think you just need to take your time a
little<00:01:51.320> slower<00:01:52.210> step<00:01:53.210> off<00:01:53.420> with<00:01:53.570> your<00:01:53.720> front

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
little slower step off with your front

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.260 
little slower step off with your front
foot<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.530> then<00:01:54.710> pop<00:01:55.070> your<00:01:55.400> back<00:01:55.940> foot<00:01:56.240> and

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
foot and then pop your back foot and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.240 
foot and then pop your back foot and
just<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.690> keep<00:01:56.870> your<00:01:57.110> board<00:01:57.290> more<00:01:57.560> flat<00:01:57.950> so

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
just to keep your board more flat so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
just to keep your board more flat so
that<00:01:58.610> one<00:01:58.850> practice<00:01:59.390> step<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.900> are

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
that one practice step that you are

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.780 
that one practice step that you are
doing<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.770> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> keep<00:02:01.460> your<00:02:01.610> board

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
doing that is going to keep your board

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.090 
doing that is going to keep your board
flat<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.110> time<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.470> see<00:02:03.650> what<00:02:03.770> happened

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
flat so that time you see what happened

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.950 
flat so that time you see what happened
is<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.220> pushed<00:02:04.610> your<00:02:04.790> back<00:02:05.030> foot<00:02:05.300> down<00:02:05.330> and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
is you pushed your back foot down and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.529 
is you pushed your back foot down and
your<00:02:06.140> board<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:06.620> went<00:02:07.460> straight<00:02:07.850> up<00:02:08.360> into

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
your board just went straight up into

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.970 
your board just went straight up into
the<00:02:08.659> air<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:10.250> again<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.759> same<00:02:10.970> right<00:02:11.240> there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the air and again the same right there

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.650 
the air and again the same right there
that<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.069> wasn't<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.430> bad<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.940> didn't<00:02:14.180> go<00:02:14.270> just

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
that one wasn't so bad it didn't go just

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.040 
that one wasn't so bad it didn't go just
straight

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
straight

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.260 
straight
up<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.290> hit<00:02:15.410> your<00:02:15.560> leg<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.920> fall<00:02:16.160> down<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:17.120> it

up and hit your leg and fall down but it
was<00:02:17.420> pretty<00:02:17.900> like<00:02:18.200> straight<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.540> know

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
was pretty like straight up you know

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.600 
was pretty like straight up you know
what<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.840> mean<00:02:21.050> no<00:02:21.500> I'm<00:02:21.560> saying<00:02:21.860> straight<00:02:22.370> up

cool so that's it right there now the
thing<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:25.640> trick<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.830> got<00:02:28.040> that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
thing with this trick is you got that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.700 
thing with this trick is you got that
part<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.880> down<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:29.420> good<00:02:29.780> it's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
part of it down and that's good it's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.680 
part of it down and that's good it's
kind<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.980> interesting<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.580> me<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.450> have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
kind of interesting to me that you have

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.350 
kind of interesting to me that you have
that<00:02:33.080> part<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.620> down<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.190> well<00:02:34.460> but<00:02:35.060> then<00:02:35.210> as

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
that part of it down so well but then as

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.820 
that part of it down so well but then as
soon<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.780> do<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.110> moving<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.560> little<00:02:36.710> bit

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
soon as you do it moving a little bit

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.610 
soon as you do it moving a little bit
you're<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:37.430> popping<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:38.030> totally<00:02:38.660> totally

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
you're just popping it totally totally

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.920 
you're just popping it totally totally
different<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> gonna<00:02:41.240> have<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.540> try<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.840> work

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
different so gonna have to try and work

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.290 
different so gonna have to try and work
out<00:02:42.110> what<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.410> do<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.880> other<00:02:44.030> thing

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
out what to do on that the other thing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.060 
out what to do on that the other thing
you<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.170> turn<00:02:45.380> your<00:02:45.560> head<00:02:45.800> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.930 
shoulders that's for sure you know what
I<00:02:50.480> think<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.840> main<00:02:51.110> problem<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.010> think<00:02:52.760> that

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I think the main problem is I think that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240 
I think the main problem is I think that
you're<00:02:53.090> not<00:02:53.240> concentrating<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
you're not concentrating on like you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.730 
you're not concentrating on like you
step<00:02:55.550> off<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.180> give<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.690> second<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.620> a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
step off you give it a second just a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.250 
step off you give it a second just a
second<00:02:58.160> as<00:02:58.340> soon<00:02:58.640> as<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.880> step<00:02:59.090> off<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.690> then

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
second as soon as you step off and then

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.530 
second as soon as you step off and then

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
popping up vertically it just goes just

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.180 
popping up vertically it just goes just
around<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.380> that's<00:03:36.739> what<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.160> should

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
around so that's what you should

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.000 
around so that's what you should
concentrate<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:38.000> very<00:03:38.630> thoroughly<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.739> just

concentrate on very thoroughly is just
doing<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.489> let's<00:03:40.970> check<00:03:41.180> out<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:41.480> slo-mo

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
doing that let's check out this slo-mo

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.890 
doing that let's check out this slo-mo
so<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.350> step<00:03:42.680> off<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.310> pop<00:03:44.270> it<00:03:44.420> around<00:03:44.660> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
so I step off and pop it around and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.479 
so I step off and pop it around and
notice<00:03:45.170> my<00:03:45.200> back<00:03:45.380> foot<00:03:45.830> stays<00:03:46.070> on<00:03:46.220> there<00:03:46.370> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
notice my back foot stays on there the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.300 
notice my back foot stays on there the
whole<00:03:46.700> time<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:47.870> one<00:03:48.140> smooth<00:03:48.590> motion<00:03:48.890> and

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
whole time so it's one smooth motion and

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.310 
whole time so it's one smooth motion and
just<00:03:49.459> concentrate<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.209> not<00:03:50.420> popping<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.110> down

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
just concentrate on not popping it down

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.740 
just concentrate on not popping it down
so<00:03:51.650> hard<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:52.670> leave<00:03:52.910> your<00:03:53.120> back<00:03:53.360> foot<00:03:53.630> on
