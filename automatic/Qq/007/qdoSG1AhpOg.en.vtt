00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.520
 Hello everyone, today I will show how to do 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 Orchid flower for folding one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.550
 flower art yourself take color paper 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.369
 square one-sided size 12 by 12 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.119
 centimeters we fold our square by 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.119
 diagonals 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.800
 and again 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.969
 we open the paper we did 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:55.000
 we put the middle line to this one 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:59.070
 side bend the triangle down and here 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 this side is also to sare not less 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.270
 now open the paper 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.539
 bending this side over to thorin 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.729
 so I let down the paper make a fold here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 she wrinkled ours now with 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.760
 On the other side, this side 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:40.150
 that's in the middle and do too 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.150
 fold 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.869
 2 fold there now to this line 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.229
 horizontally and bend this one 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.229
 the side 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.920
 here is a crease and on the other 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.920
 hand in exactly the same way 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.610
 we fold the paper diagonally now 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.670
 But on these folds we have butane 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.730
 from one side to the other we paper 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 lift into the depths like that we push and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 collect corner down here look how 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.810
 it folds from the other side exactly 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.420
 also on these two folds the paper 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.510
 pushing up and lowering the corner 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.510
 way down 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 top corner tip we should 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.170
 add up to this one 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.170
 dot 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.400
 we fold 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.349
 check 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.319
 up to this point we have developed 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:15.049
 triangle and our stocking 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.299
 we fold in half we got here 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.040
 such a figure here we have three petals 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.319
 here one two three 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.319
 turn down one petal 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.970
 and a friend on the other hand just as well 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.970
 symmetrically down 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:44.249
 raise these petals we have 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:47.450
 line folds here it is line now here 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:51.950
 this here side bends here boilers 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.950
 turn away the little triangle 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.920
 but 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.100
 here it is a diagonal fold 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.660
 open the paper and this diagonal 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.660
 fold the fold inward 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.850
 inside there were 2 triangles 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.209
 we press up and lay in this 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.209
 fold 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.010
 and so that they do not open with us do 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.490
 one more wto 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:34.360
 once again it turns up like this 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.660
 irregular long triangle he 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.170
 will keep our folds here 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.560
 the triangle we turn down now down one 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:50.250
 petal 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.250
 from the other side turn 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.210
 open the paper 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.220
 and press a little bit 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:15.720
 with and weird reveal petals again 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.720
 and pull up the paper a little bit 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.650
 Here is such a beautiful central 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.330
 we have a petal now 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.250
 turn the workpiece work with 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.400
 delicate petals here we have 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.750
 pockets finger insert into the pocket and 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:42.000
 gently pressed and turning on itself 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:45.800
 pull up the paper and lift up 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.400
 and on the other hand just the same pocket 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:56.569
 pressed a little petal and you returned 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:59.210
 smooth it over with your fingers 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:03.470
 so we got an orchid now on 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.940
 once again and all worked out and a little 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.940
 petals instead of those 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.040
 Now Canadians are so 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.510
 you can do a few 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.330
 flowers and strung them on thin 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.780
 wire and you will succeed . 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.780
 the judges
