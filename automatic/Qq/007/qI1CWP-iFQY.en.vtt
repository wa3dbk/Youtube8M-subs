 basically if they want to do this they 're going to 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.220
 go to settings then that's what here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.640
 let's go in there let's go down 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.280
 to see 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 itunes in app store inside there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 let's go down and here are the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.420
 cauterets weapons then this have 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 to pay then it 's like this the updates 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.769
 already the updates is fine because 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 it's off if you're learning how 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.370
 these greens then they will 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.500
 automatically update these things 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 how my boxes are updated 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.449
 automatically and a music 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.230
 my applications is everything here if I get low 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.720
 something on my ipad and I do not want it to appear 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.060
 on my iphone I want to pay because if I 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 and this is what that does is synced 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.740
 basically anything that gets off 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 you have come down in another in others like you 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.190
 ipod or ipad 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.900
 here is what updates come to us 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.520
 pay that if you do not want if it is that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.230
 they want to be updated 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.460
 automatically so you do not have 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.680
 to worry about you doing that 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.570
 then put on from here you can 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.660
 undertake if I have break 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 I suggest you do not do it simply 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.740
 turn it off is better 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.810
 this part of here will be released if it is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 they do not have unlimited data I suggest 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 pay this because this is going to use your 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.010
 data to download on iTunes stuff 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.330
 then preferable to turn it off equally 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.000
 here's the music thing then you have to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.000
 can turn them off or turn them on depends if 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.100
 they want to save their music in the cloud and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
 this is all for this tutorial if you have 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.150

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.320
