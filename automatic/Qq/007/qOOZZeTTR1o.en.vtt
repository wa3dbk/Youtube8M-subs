check out the the eighty-five percent

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.760 
check out the the eighty-five percent
that<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.950> says<00:01:27.130> there<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.929> battery<00:01:29.229> charge<00:01:29.500> is

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
that it says there the battery charge is

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.130 
that it says there the battery charge is
only<00:01:29.920> 70<00:01:30.369> point<00:01:30.610> five<00:01:30.819> six<00:01:31.030> percent<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.810> you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
only 70 point five six percent so you

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.770 
only 70 point five six percent so you
know<00:01:32.289> it's<00:01:32.500> 15<00:01:33.039> percent<00:01:33.310> down<00:01:33.759> from<00:01:34.539> what<00:01:34.660> it's

know it's 15 percent down from what it's
telling<00:01:34.929> you<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.500> we<00:01:35.740> see<00:01:35.920> problems<00:01:36.280> where

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
telling you and we see problems where

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.499 
telling you and we see problems where
people<00:01:36.640> have<00:01:36.729> put<00:01:36.849> battery<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:37.300> then<00:01:37.390> it'll

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
people have put battery and then it'll

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.440 
people have put battery and then it'll
cuts<00:01:37.720> out<00:01:37.899> with<00:01:38.080> 10%<00:01:38.560> 15%<00:01:38.890> 20%<00:01:39.190> ago<00:01:39.729> that's<00:01:40.240> why

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
cuts out with 10% 15% 20% ago that's why

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.389 
cuts out with 10% 15% 20% ago that's why
because<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.990> phone<00:01:41.229> readout<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.160> this<00:01:42.310> is

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
because the phone readout and this is

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.249 
because the phone readout and this is
all<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.550> battery<00:01:42.910> telling<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.300> phone<00:01:43.539> well

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
all the battery telling the phone well

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
couldn't believe this that you know it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.770 
couldn't believe this that you know it
looked<00:01:48.039> ban<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.789> looked<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.060> identical

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
looked ban you it looked it identical

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.809 
looked ban you it looked it identical
almost<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.380> one<00:01:50.500> that<00:01:50.649> that<00:01:51.340> we<00:01:51.399> supply

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
almost to the one that that we supply

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.839 
almost to the one that that we supply
but<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.690> reality<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.979> wouldn't<00:01:54.310> be<00:01:54.459> you<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.819> be

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
but in reality it wouldn't be you can be

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:55.650 
but in reality it wouldn't be you can be
further<00:01:55.090> from<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.330> truth

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
further from the truth

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.020 
further from the truth
so<00:01:56.110> well<00:01:56.349> there<00:01:56.830> we<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:57.099> now<00:01:57.580> what<00:01:57.880> i'm<00:01:57.940> going

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
so well there we go now what i'm going

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.880 
so well there we go now what i'm going
to<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.239> is<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.840> back<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.229> back<00:01:59.349> it<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.649> one

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
to do is is back to back it with one

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.339 
to do is is back to back it with one
that<00:02:00.039> we've<00:02:00.130> got<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:01.300> you'll<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:02.020> know<00:02:02.140> just

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
that we've got and you'll you know just

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.469 
that we've got and you'll you know just
to<00:02:02.410> prove<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> fact<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.179> that's<00:02:04.179> why<00:02:04.450> our

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
to prove the fact that that's why our

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.800 
to prove the fact that that's why our
batteries<00:02:05.459> cost<00:02:06.459> an<00:02:06.700> awful<00:02:07.090> lot<00:02:07.209> more<00:02:07.239> or<00:02:07.660> not

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
batteries cost an awful lot more or not

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.089 
batteries cost an awful lot more or not
an<00:02:07.869> awful<00:02:08.110> lot<00:02:08.200> more<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:08.530> sort<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:08.770> three<00:02:08.950> four

an awful lot more but sort of three four
times<00:02:09.280> more<00:02:09.429> than<00:02:09.489> cheap<00:02:09.789> battery<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.209> you

actually 3G batteries and 4s batteries

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.020 
actually 3G batteries and 4s batteries
so<00:02:26.319> far<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.129> that's<00:02:27.250> how<00:02:27.400> batteries<00:02:27.760> can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
so far so that's how batteries can

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.839 
so far so that's how batteries can
install<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> again<00:02:30.159> that<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.640> look

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
install it and again that they look

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.759 
install it and again that they look
identical<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:34.049> obviously<00:02:35.049> not

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
identical and but obviously not

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.470 
identical and but obviously not
so<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.579> powered<00:02:36.909> up<00:02:36.970> we'll<00:02:37.209> take<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.360> little

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
so it's powered up we'll take a little

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.990 
so it's powered up we'll take a little
bit<00:02:37.629> Marin<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> mean<00:02:39.610> we're<00:02:39.879> really

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.729 
bit Marin so I mean we're really
astonished<00:02:40.480> by<00:02:40.659> when<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.319> got<00:02:41.439> hold<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.650> these

it's just an absolutely incredible thing
to<00:02:56.620> see<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.129> fact<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.400> we'd<00:02:58.209> say<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> battery

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
to see the fact that we'd say a battery

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.300 
to see the fact that we'd say a battery
should<00:02:58.870> only<00:02:59.200> last<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.560> eighteen<00:02:59.889> months<00:03:00.129> of<00:03:00.220> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
should only last of eighteen months of a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.680 
should only last of eighteen months of a
regular<00:03:00.639> use<00:03:00.819> phone<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.239> will<00:03:01.329> use<00:03:01.510> ours

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
regular use phone we will use ours

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.819 
regular use phone we will use ours
regularly<00:03:02.109> normally<00:03:02.440> charge<00:03:02.650> them<00:03:02.799> overnight

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
regularly normally charge them overnight

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.039 
regularly normally charge them overnight
and<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.909> find<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.629> know<00:03:04.750> that

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
and to find out that you know that

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.379 
and to find out that you know that
battery<00:03:05.470> has<00:03:06.280> already<00:03:06.609> seen<00:03:06.819> its<00:03:07.030> full<00:03:07.209> life

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
battery has already seen its full life

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.020 
battery has already seen its full life
and<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:08.829> also<00:03:09.040> tells<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.489> find<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.849> it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
and it also tells you find that it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.050 
and it also tells you find that it's
sort<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.810> 10-15<00:03:11.470> percent<00:03:11.620> less<00:03:12.040> charge<00:03:12.370> then

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
sort of 10-15 percent less charge then

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.970 
sort of 10-15 percent less charge then
it<00:03:13.209> more<00:03:14.019> charge<00:03:14.230> than<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.560> got<00:03:14.859> in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it more charge than it's actually got in

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.369 
it more charge than it's actually got in
it<00:03:15.099> so<00:03:15.939> it's<00:03:16.299> all<00:03:16.389> about<00:03:16.420> cycle<00:03:16.930> count<00:03:17.139> really

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
it so it's all about cycle count really

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.890 
it so it's all about cycle count really
our<00:03:17.799> batteries<00:03:18.280> they<00:03:19.000> are<00:03:19.150> brand<00:03:19.450> new<00:03:19.599> they

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
our batteries they are brand new they

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.149 
our batteries they are brand new they
look<00:03:20.079> like<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.439> they<00:03:20.620> up<00:03:20.739> they're<00:03:20.889> brand<00:03:21.099> new

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
look like that they up they're brand new

people worry about that so they're

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.039 
people worry about that so they're
