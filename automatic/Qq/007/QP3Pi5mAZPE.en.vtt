and I talked to one of the guys that
work<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.149> recommended<00:00:48.420> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
work there and he recommended this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
work there and he recommended this
product<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> ion<00:00:50.789> color<00:00:51.120> brilliance

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
product it is the ion color brilliance

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
product it is the ion color brilliance
cream<00:00:52.050> leitner<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.710> says<00:00:53.309> its<00:00:53.550> enriched<00:00:53.940> with

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
wheat protein in argan oil so that's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
wheat protein in argan oil so that's
what<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.930> looks<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> at

what that looks like I got this at
Sally's<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.840> 12

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
Sally's I think this is probably like 12

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.080 
Sally's I think this is probably like 12
or<00:01:01.829> 13<00:01:01.859> dollars<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.600> inside<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.890> comes<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.610> by

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
or 13 dollars so inside it comes with by

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
or 13 dollars so inside it comes with by
the<00:01:06.150> box<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> comes<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> cream<00:01:07.500> leitner

the box it comes with the cream leitner

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
the box it comes with the cream leitner
which<00:01:08.070> obviously<00:01:08.460> I've<00:01:08.820> used<00:01:09.240> half<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
which obviously I've used half of it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.210 
which obviously I've used half of it
comes<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:10.350> applications<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> way

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
comes with two applications by the way

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.969 
comes with two applications by the way
four<00:01:11.880> packs<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.689> activator<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> have

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
four packs of the activator so I have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
four packs of the activator so I have
one<00:01:14.250> application<00:01:14.580> left<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> case<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.479> ever<00:01:15.540> want
