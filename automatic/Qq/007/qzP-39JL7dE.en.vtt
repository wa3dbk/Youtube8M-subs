 when the boy smooch the girl 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.010
 car listen to it on the radio 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.280

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.080
 has broken out 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.429
 the story is quite different from the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.929
 Boy wants to help get the girl 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.000
 stay in the park and then she stops like that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.350
 such a flock the noise on the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 things have been beheaded 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.750
 no slit with a hook 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810
 before that was 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.830
 the prospective lawyer risk for 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.770
 and now 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.489

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.920
 year, four friends were a mystery 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.720
 then we should have something going on wine has it 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.270
 yes, but not all secrets remain 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.840
 dead and buried 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.909
 nobody has sent that nobody knows 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 what you did last summer 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.090
 they thought they would live a new life 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 begin 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.000
 and that ran instead it ends in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 a dead end 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 nobody tried to kill themselves 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 the nice police would be easy 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 can kill and the mistake you make 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.120
 made it was an accident it was not 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.870
 accident it was murder if you still have it 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.600
 lived 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.409
