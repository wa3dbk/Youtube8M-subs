00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like something you would see in a video

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 
like something you would see in a video
game<00:01:05.540> instead<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.080> hey<00:01:07.229> here's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

little thing but still pretty cool
here's<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.630> looks<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here's what looks like this is one that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.060 
here's what looks like this is one that

yo Tommaso actually posted on his
twitter<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> MPC<00:02:04.259> village

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
twitter this is what the MPC village

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
twitter this is what the MPC village
looks<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> savanna<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.479> believe<00:02:07.200> this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
looks like in a savanna I believe this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.300 
looks like in a savanna I believe this
is<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.899> that's<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.039> path

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
is and that's what the the little path

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.559 
is and that's what the the little path
looks<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> savanna

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
looks like in the savanna

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.770 
looks like in the savanna
so<00:02:12.719> looks<00:02:13.650> pretty<00:02:13.890> cool<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.659> bit

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
