remembering which way it goes I marked

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.100 
remembering which way it goes I marked
mine<00:00:37.400> so<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> knew<00:00:38.120> which<00:00:38.300> way<00:00:38.510> was<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.809> back

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
mine so I knew which way was the back

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.439 
mine so I knew which way was the back
that<00:00:39.530> way<00:00:39.739> around<00:00:40.100> then<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.150> push

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
that way around then you have to push

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.329 
that way around then you have to push
the<00:00:41.809> brass<00:00:42.050> insert<00:00:42.769> our<00:00:43.989> turn<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.170> around<00:00:45.339> put

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
the brass insert our turn it around put

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.520 
the brass insert our turn it around put
it<00:00:46.430> back<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:48.260> opposite<00:00:48.710> way<00:00:50.409> keeping<00:00:51.409> your

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
it back in the opposite way keeping your

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.859 
it back in the opposite way keeping your
hole<00:00:51.739> up<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:52.699> your<00:00:52.909> set<00:00:53.119> screws<00:00:53.479> not<00:00:53.689> going<00:00:53.809> to

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
hole up so your set screws not going to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.719 
hole up so your set screws not going to
be<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.080> this<00:00:54.229> side<00:00:54.500> anymore<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.339> going<00:00:55.549> to<00:00:55.580> be

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
be on this side anymore it's going to be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.090 
be on this side anymore it's going to be
on<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.059> side<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.379> side<00:00:57.650> that<00:00:57.680> you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
on this side now the side that you

on this side now the side that you
marked<00:00:58.400> with<00:00:59.330> your<00:00:59.680> texture<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.920> need<00:01:01.129> to

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
marked with your texture you need to

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.969 
marked with your texture you need to
grind<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:02.150> little<00:01:02.210> flat<00:01:02.809> spot<00:01:03.229> on<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:03.680> side

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
grind a little flat spot on that side

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.749 
grind a little flat spot on that side
now<00:01:04.570> opposite<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.780> other<00:01:06.110> side<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.430> have<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
now opposite the other side you have to

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.280 
now opposite the other side you have to
put<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.000> flat<00:01:08.360> bit<00:01:08.600> which<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.900> bit<00:01:09.110> you've

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
marked into the set screw and that sets

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.480 
marked into the set screw and that sets
it<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.070> right<00:01:13.189> way<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:14.950> then<00:01:15.950> tighten<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
where the hole is and tighten it up I

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.880 
where the hole is and tighten it up I
leave<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.630> bit<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:53.960> pipe<00:01:54.170> these<00:01:54.440> are<00:01:54.590> already

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
leave this bit of pipe these are already

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.740 
just cut the excess pipe off there and
that's<00:02:12.950> how<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.190> put<00:02:13.489> your<00:02:13.640> g<00:02:13.849> boson<00:02:14.390> quite

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that's how you put your g boson quite

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.989 
that's how you put your g boson quite
easy
