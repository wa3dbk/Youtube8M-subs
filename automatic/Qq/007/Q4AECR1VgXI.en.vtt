another larger lamp this one was sold on
eBay<00:00:03.330> as<00:00:03.510> 24<00:00:04.140> watts<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:05.580> worm<00:00:05.790> weight

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
eBay as 24 watts and it's worm weight

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.850 
eBay as 24 watts and it's worm weight
and<00:00:06.299> I'll<00:00:06.629> just<00:00:06.750> plug<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:09.650> here's<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and I'll just plug it in here's the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.839 
and I'll just plug it in here's the
parameter<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.620> 24<00:00:14.099> volt<00:00:14.309> lamp<00:00:14.490> looks

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
parameter and the 24 volt lamp looks

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.950 
parameter and the 24 volt lamp looks
quite<00:00:15.150> bright<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> draws<00:00:16.880> 12.3<00:00:17.880> watts<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.359> not

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
quite bright and draws 12.3 watts so not

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.060 
quite bright and draws 12.3 watts so not
really<00:00:19.470> 24<00:00:19.920> watts<00:00:20.130> after<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.689> and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
really 24 watts after all and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
really 24 watts after all and
interesting<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.090> quite<00:00:24.269> happy<00:00:24.480> at

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
interesting this that I'm quite happy at

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
interesting this that I'm quite happy at
that<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.439> very<00:00:25.890> bright<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.250> it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that because it's very bright and it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
that because it's very bright and it's
going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> keep<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.150> run<00:00:27.359> cooler<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.740> I'm

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
going to keep it run cooler that but I'm

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.259 
going to keep it run cooler that but I'm
it's<00:00:29.279> interesting<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.150> aluminum

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it's interesting this is got aluminum

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's interesting this is got aluminum
fins<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.170> inside<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.949> plastic<00:00:32.790> casing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
fins and inside of this plastic casing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
fins and inside of this plastic casing
so<00:00:33.480> let's<00:00:33.660> am<00:00:33.899> let's<00:00:34.380> open<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.160> shall<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:37.730> at

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
so let's am let's open it up shall we at

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.520 
so let's am let's open it up shall we at
that<00:00:38.969> power<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.660> guessing<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that power I'm guessing it's not a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.900 
that power I'm guessing it's not a
capacitive<00:00:41.070> dropper<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.520> probably<00:00:41.820> going

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
capacitive dropper it's probably going

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.250 
capacitive dropper it's probably going
to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.270> switch<00:00:42.629> mode<00:00:42.809> power<00:00:42.840> supply

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:58.010 

so<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> come<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.219> oh<00:00:57.020> very

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
so it's not going to come off oh very

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.880 
so it's not going to come off oh very
clear<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.469> unscrews<00:00:59.190> oh<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
clear that unscrews oh and then that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
clear that unscrews oh and then that
falls<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:04.939> nice<00:01:05.939> heat<00:01:06.210> sink<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.960> little

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
falls out nice heat sink and a little

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.399 
falls out nice heat sink and a little
switch<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.740> power<00:01:08.010> supply<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> back

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.679 

let's<00:01:13.409> say<00:01:13.619> unwrap<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.460> Mississippi<00:01:15.299> engine

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
let's say unwrap that Mississippi engine

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
let's say unwrap that Mississippi engine
I<00:01:16.070> can<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:18.360> just

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I can always there actually I might just

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.620 
I can always there actually I might just
cut<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> wires<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.880> cruel<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
cut the wires in that if I'm cruel to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
cut the wires in that if I'm cruel to
start<00:01:21.900> ripping<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.409> lamp<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> bits<00:01:23.009> although

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
start ripping this lamp to bits although

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.390 
start ripping this lamp to bits although
I<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:23.880> said<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.600> why<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> bought<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I think said that that's why I bought it

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.620 
I think said that that's why I bought it
let's<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> tip<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.420> at

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
let's see I can take the tip off at

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
let's see I can take the tip off at
first<00:01:28.340> like<00:01:29.340> no<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.970> let's<00:01:30.600> cut

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
first like no you know what let's cut

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
first like no you know what let's cut
the<00:01:30.930> wire<00:01:31.110> bring<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the wire bring it right out you can

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
the wire bring it right out you can
always<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:35.970> maker<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.780> joining<00:01:37.020> leash

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
always do some maker or joining leash

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.410 
always do some maker or joining leash
Roland<00:01:37.680> air<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.250> back<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:41.030> we<00:01:42.030> go

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.130 

so<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:48.290> glad<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.380> teeth<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:51.140> look

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so I'm glad that teeth is really a look

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
so I'm glad that teeth is really a look
that<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.409> certainly<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.890> captain<00:01:53.520> tip<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that is certainly not captain tip it's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.430 
that is certainly not captain tip it's
just<00:01:54.270> generic<00:01:54.689> sticky<00:01:55.170> tape<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
just generic sticky tape I think

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.500 
just generic sticky tape I think
I'm<00:01:56.950> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.220> have<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.430> get<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.730> knife<00:01:58.270> into

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
I'm going to have to get the knife into

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:15.300 
I'm going to have to get the knife into
this<00:02:11.190> shorter<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.370> capacitor<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.130> case

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
this shorter that capacitor just in case

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.050 
this shorter that capacitor just in case
it's<00:02:15.460> getting<00:02:15.760> nasty<00:02:15.880> surprises<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.790> looks

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
it's getting nasty surprises so it looks

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.630 
it's getting nasty surprises so it looks
like<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> fairly<00:02:19.840> typical<00:02:20.200> power<00:02:21.070> supply<00:02:21.580> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
like a fairly typical power supply to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.440 
like a fairly typical power supply to
college<00:02:22.210> it's<00:02:22.420> got<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> chip<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
college it's got a chip in there now the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.330 
college it's got a chip in there now the
chip<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.960> recess<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.890> between<00:02:27.040> other

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
chip is recess there between other

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.590 
chip is recess there between other
components<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.000> mean<00:02:28.150> I'll<00:02:28.270> be<00:02:28.300> able<00:02:28.540> to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
components I mean I'll be able to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:45.820 
components I mean I'll be able to
actually<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.140> read<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.400> about<00:02:30.940> gurgle

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.040 

I<00:02:46.180> may<00:02:47.180> not<00:02:47.300> be<00:02:47.480> able<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.630> read<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.930> because

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
I may not be able to read it because

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.680 
I may not be able to read it because
it's<00:02:48.260> not<00:02:48.440> an<00:02:48.650> umber<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:52.360> don't<00:02:53.360> think

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
it's not an umber on it I don't think

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
it's not an umber on it I don't think
it's<00:02:53.810> got<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.960> number<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.350> it

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's got a number on it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:15.480 
it's got a number on it
oh<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.800> know<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.160> know<00:03:03.550> it's<00:03:04.550> not<00:03:04.790> gonna<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.360> it

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.400 
though this transformer may know of that
many<00:03:51.730> connections<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.660> may<00:03:58.840> actually<00:03:58.990> just

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
many connections so it may actually just

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.540 
many connections so it may actually just
be<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> buck<00:03:59.890> regulator<00:04:01.890> which<00:04:02.890> means<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
be a buck regulator which means that the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.710 
be a buck regulator which means that the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
output of that let's say just means it

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
output of that let's say just means it
may<00:04:07.870> not<00:04:08.080> have<00:04:08.320> our<00:04:08.350> direct<00:04:08.740> connection<00:04:09.160> rode

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
through not that it's exposed so it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.350 
through not that it's exposed so it
doesn't<00:04:11.350> really<00:04:11.470> matter<00:04:13.740> then<00:04:14.740> on<00:04:15.130> these<00:04:15.400> type

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360

don't<00:04:47.920> think<00:04:48.130> that's<00:04:48.340> 100%<00:04:49.030> necessary<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.070> it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
don't think that's 100% necessary but it

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.760 
don't think that's 100% necessary but it
would<00:04:51.220> probably<00:04:51.250> have<00:04:51.700> helped<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:53.380> take<00:04:53.590> the

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
hot it gets a normal operation and maybe

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.990 
hot it gets a normal operation and maybe
I'll<00:05:20.200> put<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.830> thermocouple<00:05:21.370> on<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:21.850> there

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
I'll put a thermocouple on it and there

check that out really sure yeah so an

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.500 
check that out really sure yeah so an

all<00:05:31.530> technically<00:05:32.530> speaking<00:05:32.920> you<00:05:33.160> could<00:05:33.310> put

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
all technically speaking you could put

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.670 
all technically speaking you could put

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
your fingers and on to the heatsink but

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.400 
your fingers and on to the heatsink but

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
across that yes coming at the usual 50

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.460 
across that yes coming at the usual 50
volts<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:19.110> area<00:06:20.110> and<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:21.100> was<00:06:21.190> about<00:06:21.370> 12<00:06:21.790> watts

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
volts of area and it was about 12 watts

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.590 
volts of area and it was about 12 watts
so<00:06:23.470> and<00:06:24.120> 12<00:06:25.120> Watts<00:06:25.360> divided<00:06:26.200> by<00:06:26.730> 50<00:06:27.730> volts<00:06:28.150> the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
so and 12 Watts divided by 50 volts the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.800 
so and 12 Watts divided by 50 volts the
current<00:06:28.630> is<00:06:29.260> going<00:06:29.380> to<00:06:29.470> be<00:06:29.640> run<00:06:30.640> about<00:06:30.790> 240<00:06:31.600> but

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
current is going to be run about 240 but

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.050 
current is going to be run about 240 but
divided<00:06:32.320> by<00:06:32.500> 2<00:06:32.560> because<00:06:32.860> those<00:06:33.340> pairs<00:06:33.670> of<00:06:33.760> LEDs

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
divided by 2 because those pairs of LEDs

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.160 
divided by 2 because those pairs of LEDs
and<00:06:34.180> parles<00:06:34.510> asking<00:06:34.810> about<00:06:34.900> 120<00:06:35.710> mil<00:06:35.860> emeriti

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
and parles asking about 120 mil emeriti

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.690 
and parles asking about 120 mil emeriti
which<00:06:38.170> is<00:06:38.320> pretty<00:06:38.590> typical<00:06:39.010> of<00:06:39.220> sports<00:06:39.520> the

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
which is pretty typical of sports the

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.840 
which is pretty typical of sports the
LED<00:06:40.290> yes<00:06:41.290> an<00:06:41.560> interesting<00:06:42.160> lamp<00:06:42.400> it's<00:06:42.610> quite

LED yes an interesting lamp it's quite

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.280 
LED yes an interesting lamp it's quite
nice<00:06:43.030> let<00:06:43.240> me<00:06:43.360> just<00:06:43.540> stick<00:06:43.870> that<00:06:43.930> back

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
nice let me just stick that back

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.330 
nice let me just stick that back
together<00:06:44.530> access<00:06:45.070> quite<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.400> nice<00:06:45.610> lamp<00:06:45.940> indeed
