00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:10.910
 Well then Wakozu engine power shield 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.910
 First of all , I will explain the characteristics of one objective oil leak 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.440
 This is Yes soaking in the rubber of the oil seal through the engine par shield 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.640
 It is mayor 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.420
 Though it is the same new part 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 5 minutes swell by putting on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.460
 This will clean oil leaks 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.070
 Followed by 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 Oilers and oil drops that occur in the engine 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.770
 Do an experiment 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.770
 This is genuine assistance that is usually used 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 Here 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.210
 I have a hole 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 This is the inside of the engine in the car 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.100
 It represents the state in which the leaking oil is leaking in many places 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.100
 I will try this for a moment 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.600
 Oil will come out like this 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.020
 Next is this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 We are stuck the engine par seal to the engine oil 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.350
 Add 2 to something similar to your skin 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 Just shake it on the radio 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.579
 Say earlier 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.580
 There is almost no leak like this
