to get around you can totally get around
fine<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:57.050> think<00:04:57.320> it's<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.650> better

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
fine and I think it's a better

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.300 
fine and I think it's a better
investment<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.550> buy<00:04:58.729> even<00:04:59.690> if<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.050> pay<00:05:00.310> $700

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
investment to buy even if you pay $700

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.100

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
it I think in the end it'll still be

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.010 
it I think in the end it'll still be
cheaper<00:05:10.099> than<00:05:10.220> let's<00:05:11.090> say<00:05:11.150> paying<00:05:11.539> for<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> more
