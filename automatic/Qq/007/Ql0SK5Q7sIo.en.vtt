times and then swing four to six times
you<00:01:57.580> want<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:57.940> explosive<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.080> want<00:01:59.260> to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
you want to be explosive and you want to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.930 
you want to be explosive and you want to
go<00:01:59.470> as<00:01:59.680> fast<00:02:00.010> as<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:06.729> after

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
go as fast as you can right after

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.990 
go as fast as you can right after

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
throwing the medicine ball you swing as

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:44.890 

the<00:02:31.280> idea<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.610> use<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> whole<00:02:32.420> body

followed by their normal racket at
maximum<00:02:53.940> speed<00:02:59.360> here<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.690> use<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.700> kid's

normal with the light racket and then

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.320 
normal with the light racket and then
try<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.519> same<00:03:17.730> thing<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.180> your

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.160 

it's<00:03:23.519> important<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.930> balls

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
it's important to have all the balls

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.000 
it's important to have all the balls
together<00:03:26.269> so<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.870> repeat<00:03:28.799> those

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
together so that you can repeat those

00:03:29.010 --> 00:04:05.449 
together so that you can repeat those
swings<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.940> after<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> other<00:03:30.569> one
