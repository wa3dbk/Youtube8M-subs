00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 Mazda's cx 3 gaining popularity in the compact suv 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:15.180
 I tried to collect the impression of the owner who has already been delivered what kind of car actually 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.270
 I think that you can refer to 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.190
 Kato's opinion 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:26.480
 I think that diesel engine sound for the transfer from gasoline-powered vehicles is a concern 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:31.850
 It is said that the natural sound smoother diesel engine specific rattle 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 I was wondering if I could adopt the world's first adoption system to reduce knocking cherry blossoms. 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.520
 Even if you don't attach the Smoother, you don't have to worry about the engine noise, so don't even attach it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.620
 I feel there is no big difference 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.010
 Suzuki's opinion 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.649
 I was worried that the width of the car was large 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.910
 I live in a residential area but there is no problem at all 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:59.079
 When arranging the Demio looks big, but with respect to operation 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.610
 I felt almost the same as Demio 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:10.380
 Rest assured that you can easily manage 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 The first impression of running Mr. Yoshida's opinion engine is so quiet that it is misunderstood as a gasoline car 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.140
 was 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.780
 There is almost no feeling of diesel even when running 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 The sense of torque is comparable to the 1.6 liter turbo of gasoline 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.700
 The feeling of acceleration did not seem to accelerate unlike the gasoline car and it was a feeling that an unexpected speed was given 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.789
 Mr. Takemoto 's opinion 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:41.810
 Good to notice they are accelerated by the torque sense of diesel has not been a good acceleration 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:48.590
 It is driving performance that will be speed 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:51.030
 Winding high speed curve winding mountain road very uncomfortable without roll 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 It is a stable run 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:00.869
 Only the opinion of 4 owners could be told this time 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.940
 Though it is a diesel car as a general rule, the running is stable and quiet 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:10.100
 It turned out that it was a finished car that acceleration was not inconvenient . 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 Please by all means try to consider
