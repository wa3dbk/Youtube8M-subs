00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.440
 volkswagen is dismantling itself with the 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.080
 new generation of golf the seventh has 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.269
 released the gti version with 220 horses 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.730
 and an evolution of this with 10 horses 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.160
 more creating the most benefit gti of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.050
 the whole saga having won the world 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.080
 of rallies has released the limited version 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.330
 pole r world rally championship with 220 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.970
 horses and to commemorate it they have created 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.770
 2,500 units and for those who 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.840
 We want benefits with heaven for 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.930
 roof take away an eye with golf 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.210
 cabrio r the r is the cabrio golf more 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.490
 powerful to date and if you have 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.930
 guessed is also the convertible with 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.340
 more horses of all the history of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.200
 volkswagen 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.750
 but we believe that this car has a trick 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.670
 It is not a r as it has us accustomed 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.190
 the brand with its sporty character a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.400
 both extreme and its traction at four o'clock 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.710
 wheels we consider it more an evolution 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.660
 The GTI has no traction at four o'clock 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.270
 wheels because it would increase the weight a lot 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.129
 that already exceeds 1,600 kilos and 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.500
 especially because the differential 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.110
 back is not here behind so 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.900
 the power goes to the ground only with 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.760
 the front wheels 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.220
 but the truth is that it does it quite 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.750
 well we can give gas with confidence in 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 closed curves that do not lose traction 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.250
 even at high rates 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.980
 in volkswagen do not get scared by 265 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.170
 horses on a single axis and not for having 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
 mounted an electronic differential but 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 because they have worked a lot in the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.110
 suspensions have worked them 25 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.080
 millimeters and they have three modes of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.300
 normal comfortable functioning and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.280
 sports we are going to make a comparison 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.440
 so you can see the difference between 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 suspension in comfort mode and mode 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.520
 We are going to make the same curve to the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 same speed first with the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.320
 suspensions in comfortable mode and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.690
 then in sport mode although in mode 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 comfort are already hard but very nice 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.009
 in sport mode the car is much more 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.009
 quick reactions and rotates more plane 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.130
 in our country the series mounts and is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.380
 what has to carry the surname r many 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.630
 we would settle for the gti and even 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.670
 much less is much more rational without 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.430
 stop being pretty sporty and also 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.500
 it costs about twelve thousand euros less as 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 We explain the higher price the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 r version carries a standard equipment 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.800
 far superior to the gt and concretely some 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.420
 Six thousand euros higher in elements 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640
 like the heated leather seats 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.250
 with the r emblem the 19 rims 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.620
 inches older brakes 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 dimensions and with specific clamps in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 Black color for special hits for 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.390
 the needles of the blue clocks 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.209
 with what we have about 6,000 euros 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.400
 for the greatest power and is that for very 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.400
 well that sounds the gti this snoring 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.980
 It is unique from the r 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.180
 six thousand euros for a lot of snoring 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.510
 women threw their hands to the head 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.430
 but if my husband does it for free tests 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.080
 apart in this car have worked a lot 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
 the acoustics so that it sounds especially 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.280
 sporting is technically the engine of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.130
 gti but the block has been reinforced 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.800
 engine and cranks the turbo blows at 1.2 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.060
 bars have new electronics and account 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.790
 standard with automatic gearbox 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.360
 double sgx clutch the same as 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.360
 ride the gti 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 so how much does it accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.410
 in 64 seconds and has the speed 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.040
 maximum self-limited at 250 kilometers 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.780
 hour 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.660
 and standardizes an average consumption of 8.2 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.910
 liters to the heavens and all this being able 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.769
 remove the hood in 9 seconds and with the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.019
 Car running less than 30 kilometers 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.569
 per hour is a very simple hood of 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.849
 save and use but very elaborate with 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.489
 three types of fabrics well combined for 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.319
 offer insulation and aerodynamics together 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.670
 with the comfort and rigidity of your 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.670
 structure of four crossbars 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.480
 this combination of convertible roof 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.500
 sports performance and roar of 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.129
 engine is provided by the few cars 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.129
 enjoy the top you see 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.810
 or not
