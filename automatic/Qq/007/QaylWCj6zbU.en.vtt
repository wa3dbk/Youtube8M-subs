 home the students who have finished 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.420
 the school year has the possibility 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.069
 to try a seafaring sport e 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.569
 especially to learn what they are 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.489
 the fundamental values ​​of the navy 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.470
 military but in general of who goes for 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.690
 sea ​​those of the solidarity of the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.090
 crew work script of 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 group and above all respect for the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.850
 sea e 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.850
 and the environment 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.060
 this indeed common case has led to us 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.250
 how do you look at choosing this type of 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.920
 investment and continue over time with 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.760
 This investment caskets are 12 years 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.010
 that we are in the industry we have become 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.700
 probably the marker that offers the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.890
 greater complement to the sea 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.650
 by sponsoring others 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.359
 because there is this kind of continuity that 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.819
 made it into the regattas 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.819
