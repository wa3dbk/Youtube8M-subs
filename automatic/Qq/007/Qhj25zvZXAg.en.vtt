laziness<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.450> effort<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
laziness it was just so much effort and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
laziness it was just so much effort and
it<00:00:50.280> wasn't<00:00:50.489> wasn't<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:53.489> my

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it wasn't wasn't down for that so and my

hair is very thin and very straight

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
hair is very thin and very straight
naturally<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.629> impossible<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.410> do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
naturally so it's like impossible to do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
naturally so it's like impossible to do
anything<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.609> fine<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.000> straight<00:01:00.449> hair

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
anything with fine and straight hair

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
anything with fine and straight hair
after<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.219> washed<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.359> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
after you just washed it and it's so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020 
after you just washed it and it's so
frustrating<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.650> annoying<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.729> that's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
frustrating and just annoying so that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
frustrating and just annoying so that's
why<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> stopped<00:01:06.689> washing<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.200> hair<00:01:07.380> everyday

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
why I stopped washing my hair everyday

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
why I stopped washing my hair everyday
and<00:01:08.090> obviously<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.810> from

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and obviously when you just go from

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.670 
and obviously when you just go from
washing<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.010> hair<00:01:11.159> everyday<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.680> skipping

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
washing your hair everyday to skipping

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
washing your hair everyday to skipping
one<00:01:13.830> day<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.369> hair's<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.820> freak<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
one day your hair's gonna freak out and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.980 
one day your hair's gonna freak out and
get<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.470> oily<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
get all oily and that's because when you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
get all oily and that's because when you
wash<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.259> hair<00:01:19.619> everyday<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.310> actually

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
wash your hair everyday you're actually

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.039 
wash your hair everyday you're actually
stripping<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.869> its<00:01:22.020> natural<00:01:22.259> oils

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
stripping it of all its natural oils

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
stripping it of all its natural oils
therefore<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.710> scalp<00:01:26.159> automatically<00:01:26.820> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
therefore your scalp automatically just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.859 
therefore your scalp automatically just
produces<00:01:27.479> new<00:01:27.810> oils<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:29.130> oils<00:01:29.549> because

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
produces new oils and more oils because

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
produces new oils and more oils because
it's<00:01:30.869> trying<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.549> back<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's trying to get back when it's just

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.730 
it's trying to get back when it's just
been<00:01:33.750> stripped<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.930> learned<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
been stripped of and so I learned all of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850 
been stripped of and so I learned all of
this<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:39.110> researching<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.500> training

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
all that kind of stuff and after that I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.050 
all that kind of stuff and after that I
just<00:02:45.030> started<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:46.470> I'd<00:02:47.430> wash<00:02:47.849> my<00:02:47.879> hair<00:02:48.299> like

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
just started like I'd wash my hair like

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.789 
just started like I'd wash my hair like
once<00:02:51.060> every<00:02:51.390> four<00:02:51.690> days<00:02:51.930> or<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.620> then

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
once every four days or one and then

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.009 
once every four days or one and then
once<00:02:52.980> every<00:02:53.280> five<00:02:53.489> days<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.660> basically

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
once every five days and I basically

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.399 
once every five days and I basically
just<00:02:55.260> worked<00:02:55.680> myself<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.670> now<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.989> go

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
just worked myself up to now I can go

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.670 
just worked myself up to now I can go
this<00:02:58.620> long<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.159> my<00:02:59.400> hair<00:02:59.640> doesn't<00:03:00.060> produce

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
this long and my hair doesn't produce

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.009 
this long and my hair doesn't produce
crazy<00:03:01.680> amounts<00:03:02.159> of<00:03:02.250> oil<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.599> kind<00:03:03.900> of

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
crazy amounts of oil and it just kind of

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.190 
crazy amounts of oil and it just kind of
is<00:03:04.579> used<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.120> guess<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.989> makes

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
is used to it I guess if that makes

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.520 
is used to it I guess if that makes
sense

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
sense

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.539 
sense
um<00:03:08.329> but<00:03:09.329> there<00:03:09.480> were<00:03:09.629> are<00:03:10.069> there<00:03:11.069> are<00:03:11.280> some

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
um but there were are there are some

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.430 
um but there were are there are some
tricks<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:12.060> picked<00:03:12.359> up<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.290> sure

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
tricks that I picked up on and I'm sure

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.289 
tricks that I picked up on and I'm sure
everyone<00:03:13.950> knows<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:16.019> they<00:03:16.169> do<00:03:16.230> work

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
everyone knows this but they do work

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.699 
everyone knows this but they do work
basically<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.480> days<00:03:18.720> where<00:03:19.079> my<00:03:19.109> hair<00:03:19.470> just

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.110 
favorite it's a little bit pricey I just
get<00:04:06.329> at<00:04:06.449> shopper's<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.109> think<00:04:07.319> it's<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:08.120> ten

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
get at shopper's I think it's like ten

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.349 
get at shopper's I think it's like ten
to<00:04:09.389> fifteen<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:11.220> kind<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.669> range<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.299> a

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
to fifteen that kind of range so it's a

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.629 
to fifteen that kind of range so it's a
little<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.720> pricier<00:04:13.319> for<00:04:13.590> drugstore<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.310> guess

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
little bit pricier for drugstore I guess

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.199 
little bit pricier for drugstore I guess
but<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.930> works<00:04:16.530> wonders<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.250> again<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.789> usually

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
but it works wonders and again I usually

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.020 
but it works wonders and again I usually
put<00:04:18.389> this<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.660> at<00:04:18.810> night<00:04:19.079> because<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.949> is<00:04:20.159> it

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
put this on at night because it is it

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.089 
put this on at night because it is it
does<00:04:21.180> come<00:04:21.390> out<00:04:21.419> white<00:04:21.719> like<00:04:22.469> powdery<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
does come out white like powdery and

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.060 
does come out white like powdery and
stuff

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
stuff

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.300 
stuff
and<00:04:24.630> yeah<00:04:25.630> that's<00:04:25.900> basically<00:04:26.110> what<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> do<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
and yeah that's basically what I do and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.930 
and yeah that's basically what I do and
I've<00:04:28.270> seen<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:29.050> big<00:04:29.380> improvement<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:30.160> my<00:04:30.490> hair

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
I've seen a big improvement in my hair

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.850 
I've seen a big improvement in my hair
and<00:04:32.430> yeah<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.460> mean<00:04:33.940> it's<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:35.260> much<00:04:35.320> easier<00:04:35.470> to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
and yeah I mean it's so much easier to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.490 
and yeah I mean it's so much easier to
work<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.070> when<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.610> know<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:36.880> like<00:04:37.390> I<00:04:37.690> have

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
work with when you know you like I have

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.000 
work with when you know you like I have
some<00:04:38.740> structure<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.280> my<00:04:39.550> hair<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:39.880> some

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
some structure to my hair and some

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.430 
some structure to my hair and some
dirtiness<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:42.970> that's<00:04:43.600> what<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.870> do<00:04:43.960> and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
dirtiness to it and that's what I do and

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.330 
dirtiness to it and that's what I do and
it's<00:04:45.100> I've<00:04:46.000> seen<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.420> lot<00:04:46.710> better<00:04:47.710> improvement

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it's I've seen a lot better improvement

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.720 
it's I've seen a lot better improvement
in<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:48.580> hair<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:50.310> obviously<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.490> isn't

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
in my hair and so obviously this isn't

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.820 
in my hair and so obviously this isn't
for<00:04:52.000> everyone<00:04:52.240> if<00:04:52.660> you<00:04:53.110> don't<00:04:53.380> want<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.710> go

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
for everyone if you don't want to go

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.200 
for everyone if you don't want to go
through<00:04:54.070> training<00:04:54.220> your<00:04:54.550> hair<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:55.000> if<00:04:55.060> you're

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
through training your hair and if you're

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.610 
through training your hair and if you're
not<00:04:55.590> if<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.740> don't<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.420> dirty<00:04:58.420> hair<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:59.170> don't

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
not if you don't like dirty hair I don't

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.250 
not if you don't like dirty hair I don't
know<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.220> guess<00:05:00.670> there's<00:05:00.910> most<00:05:01.720> people<00:05:02.080> don't

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
know I guess there's most people don't

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.770 
know I guess there's most people don't
but<00:05:03.010> if<00:05:03.310> it's<00:05:03.820> something<00:05:04.150> you're<00:05:04.270> into<00:05:04.720> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
but if it's something you're into I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.990 
but if it's something you're into I
would<00:05:04.930> highly<00:05:05.860> recommend<00:05:05.890> it<00:05:06.550> because<00:05:06.580> it

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
would highly recommend it because it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.800 
would highly recommend it because it
saves<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.930> lot<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.140> time<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:09.330> water<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.660> all

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
saves a lot of time and water and all

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.470 
saves a lot of time and water and all
that<00:05:10.840> fun<00:05:11.260> stuff<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.100> just<00:05:12.340> makes<00:05:13.300> your

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480
