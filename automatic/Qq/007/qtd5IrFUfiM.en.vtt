00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.470 

in<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:04.799> case<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.339> see<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.850> patient<00:00:06.270> has

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
in this case we see that the patient has

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.320 
in this case we see that the patient has
some<00:00:06.750> severe<00:00:07.200> decay<00:00:07.620> both<00:00:08.370> between<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.090> teeth

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
some severe decay both between the teeth

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.190 
some severe decay both between the teeth
and<00:00:09.540> around<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> gum<00:00:10.830> line<00:00:11.929> it's<00:00:12.929> very

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and around the gum line it's very

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.849 
and around the gum line it's very
important<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.460> decay<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:15.059> removed

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
important that all the decay be removed

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859 
important that all the decay be removed
otherwise<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.760> continue<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.570> grow

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
otherwise it will just continue to grow

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.670 
otherwise it will just continue to grow
under<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.650> filling<00:00:20.010> material<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:21.680> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
under the filling material in this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.640 
under the filling material in this
sequence<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.960> checking<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.260> decay

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
sequence we see checking for decay

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.460 
sequence we see checking for decay
around<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.430> gum<00:00:26.640> line<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:28.109> very

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
around the gum line and it's very

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.540 
around the gum line and it's very
important<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> check<00:00:29.279> every<00:00:29.970> tooth<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:34.550> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
important to check every tooth in this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.930 
important to check every tooth in this
case<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:36.390> drilling<00:00:36.840> was<00:00:37.170> necessary<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
case some drilling was necessary for the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.619 
case some drilling was necessary for the
complete<00:00:39.329> removal<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:40.020> decay<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:42.420> might

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
complete removal of decay you might

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.350 
complete removal of decay you might
notice<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.469> drill<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.550> light<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
notice that the drill has a light in it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.560 
notice that the drill has a light in it
which<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.469> gives<00:00:47.160> us<00:00:47.340> better<00:00:47.730> vision<00:00:50.570> in

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
which actually gives us better vision in

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990 
which actually gives us better vision in
this<00:00:52.110> case<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.039> blue<00:00:53.370> rubber<00:00:53.640> dam

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
this case we see that a blue rubber dam

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
this case we see that a blue rubber dam
has<00:00:54.360> been<00:00:54.629> applied<00:00:55.079> around<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> teeth<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
has been applied around the teeth in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.650 
has been applied around the teeth in
order<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.820> isolate<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> saliva

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
order to isolate them from the saliva

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
order to isolate them from the saliva
next<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.780> conditioning<00:01:01.440> solution<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.190> being

thicker more viscous layer of resin

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.280 
thicker more viscous layer of resin
you'll<00:01:41.130> notice<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.290> inside

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you'll notice that it's put in inside

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.130 
you'll notice that it's put in inside
what<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.680> call<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> crown<00:01:44.340> form<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> going

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
what we call a crown form which is going

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.899 
what we call a crown form which is going
to<00:01:46.259> replace<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.520> actual<00:01:47.759> form<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> tooth

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
to replace the actual form of the tooth

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.770 
to replace the actual form of the tooth
the<00:01:50.909> excess<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.799> scraped<00:01:52.799> away<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.780> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the excess is scraped away and it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
the excess is scraped away and it's
sculpted<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> shape<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> original

the tooth is shaped with hand
instruments<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:16.710> eventually<00:02:17.090> drills

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.100 

we<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:26.550> continued<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> finishing<00:02:27.840> process

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we then continued the finishing process

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.850 
we then continued the finishing process
with<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> series<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.630> disks<00:02:33.260> after<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.410> disking

strips to smooth the areas between the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.900 
strips to smooth the areas between the
teeth<00:02:45.710> you'll<00:02:46.710> note<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.310> still<00:02:47.640> a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
teeth you'll note that this still a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.480 
teeth you'll note that this still a
space<00:02:48.390> between<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.990> teeth<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> we<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:50.340> now

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
space between the teeth and we are now

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.000 
space between the teeth and we are now
going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.940> proceed<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.630> close<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.140> space

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.980 

what<00:02:59.010> we're<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.610> do<00:03:00.000> essentially<00:03:00.630> is

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
what we're going to do essentially is

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.830 
what we're going to do essentially is
the<00:03:01.620> same<00:03:01.860> process<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.270> tooth<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the same process to the tooth on the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.020
