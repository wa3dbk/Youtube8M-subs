00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
torchlight one like a real full MMO but

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.100 
torchlight one like a real full MMO but
so<00:01:00.339> many<00:01:00.430> people<00:01:00.550> asked<00:01:01.089> just<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.780> version

that we decided it's a better idea to

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.690 
that we decided it's a better idea to
make<00:01:05.140> torchlight<00:01:05.560> 2<00:01:05.770> very<00:01:06.310> simple

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
make torchlight 2 very simple

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.810 
make torchlight 2 very simple
multiplayer<00:01:07.240> game<00:01:07.509> we<00:01:08.200> made<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.820> torchlight

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
multiplayer game we made a torchlight

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.730 
multiplayer game we made a torchlight
one<00:01:10.090> was<00:01:10.330> like<00:01:10.479> one<00:01:10.720> city<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> dungeons

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
one was like one city and the dungeons

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.440 
one was like one city and the dungeons
underneath<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.580> now<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.790> world<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.240> much

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
underneath so now the world is much

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.240 
underneath so now the world is much
bigger<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:14.110> go<00:01:14.229> over<00:01:14.440> land<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.950> different

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
bigger you go over land to different

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.669 
bigger you go over land to different
cities<00:01:15.460> there's<00:01:16.179> all<00:01:16.479> new<00:01:16.660> dungeons<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.380> so

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
cities there's all new dungeons and so

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.230 
cities there's all new dungeons and so
the<00:01:17.800> world<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.130> much<00:01:18.280> bigger<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:19.000> feels

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
the world is much bigger and it feels

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.630 
the world is much bigger and it feels
like<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> more<00:01:20.200> complete<00:01:20.500> world<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.399> it's<00:01:21.520> sort

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
like a more complete world so it's sort

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.940 
like a more complete world so it's sort
of<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.820> halfway<00:01:22.179> step<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.690> an<00:01:22.780> MMO<00:01:23.140> but<00:01:23.830> it's

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
of a halfway step to an MMO but it's

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.290
