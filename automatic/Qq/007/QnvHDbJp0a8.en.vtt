00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.090
 according to my theories about snes remix n64 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 Today remix and remix gamecube follows the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.759
 remix the most successful nintendo 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 console for a long time 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.450
 Nevertheless, I want to say that I am 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.529
 that is extremely unlikely 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.060
 Alone if you look at that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.560
 screen of this remix player looks 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 it's such a thick frame 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 surrounded and I believe in gamecube uni 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.800
 it does not look so intoxicating and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 that's why I do not believe it there but 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 we face still together which 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.460
 games would be like a remix for 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 would probably now be available 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 nintendo wii banias remix not around 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 the licenses of third party games 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.789
 endeavor that means bad cards for 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 Sonic justins guitar hero disney micky 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.140
 epic monster hunter resident evil 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 raymond call of duty red steel harvest 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 moon and everything that goes with it 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 but he does not need it yet 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.690
 just like the gamecube has the like on 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.160
 so many nintendo carita in the morning 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.699
 Now let's see if there are three 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 remixes with a damn lot of games beginning 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 Of course that must be wii sports 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.760
 and wii play zelda twilight princess 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.510
 of course I am aware of the gamecube 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 let out 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.159
 to give it to the wii that does not have 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 so much comes to zelda skyward sword 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 but still princess herself is trolling 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.509
 this would not remix on gamecube 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 bring but like remix wario ware 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.070

 Mario Party 8 and Mario and Sonic It 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 give three pieces and put the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.040
 beautiful and share 1 mario in every remix 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.230
 and sonic pasta or just as great 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.710
 paper mario and wii fit is like remix 1 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.870
 really fat the second remix of the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.880
 last 2007 title is left cross 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.710
 Training so I've just got a 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 zelda play consistently see that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.760
 represents zelda in the second remix then 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 of course, the absolute mega 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.620
 Kracher here with super smash bros brawl 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.680

 agers animal crossing is on wii music 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.230
 a bit of the outsider got me 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.510
 many have not bought much that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.830
 bfm is not worth it for a like ratings 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 also new super mario bros wii 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.990
 make our thing the new punch out and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.880
 wii sports so I think we too mx2 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.730
 can really see each other 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.260
 we have the latest games of the foura 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.030

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.940
 to play the world so have 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 came out super mario galaxy 2 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.350
 donkey kong country returns metroid 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.940
 kirby and the magical yarn mario sports 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.570

 fever is also a nintendo wii 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.440
 it could but it could still just 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.720
 from what do you think was on the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.910
 third remix nice with donkey kong with 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.850
 samus with mario with kirby twice kirby 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.630
 Although if you can not just come back 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.480
 That's why I like it 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.850
 I will not alone view remix that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.630
 we too a bit too presumptuous 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:31.600
 you have to look at the world 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.790
 imagine view is of course nonsense 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.020
 but if you're upset maybe 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.030
 gameboy and gmx and the srx still wanted 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.880
 To see and hear more you write the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.970
 kombis otherwise thank you for 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.050
 watch and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.450
 if I forgot something 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.700
 Disney comics should always write 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.850
 this is a conditional eno games 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.800
 beautiful philosophy but decisive 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.390
 I would like that I would like me 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.610

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.420
