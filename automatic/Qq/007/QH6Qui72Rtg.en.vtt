00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
struggle wherever you want and I would

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.130 
struggle wherever you want and I would
recommend<00:00:31.009> doing<00:00:31.220> that<00:00:31.430> first<00:00:31.820> now<00:00:32.689> after<00:00:32.870> you

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
recommend doing that first now after you

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.620 
recommend doing that first now after you
go<00:00:33.260> around<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.829> just<00:00:34.550> get<00:00:34.910> everything<00:00:34.940> you're

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
go around and just get everything you're

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.120 
go around and just get everything you're
probably<00:00:35.960> going<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.230> want<00:00:36.290> to<00:00:36.500> start<00:00:36.829> killing

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
probably going to want to start killing

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.300 
probably going to want to start killing
stuff<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.750> would<00:00:39.440> recommend<00:00:39.470> at<00:00:40.100> lower

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
stuff so I would recommend at lower

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.700 
stuff so I would recommend at lower
levels<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:40.910> get<00:00:41.090> power<00:00:41.330> weapons<00:00:41.810> power

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
levels you get power weapons power

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.440 
levels you get power weapons power
weapons<00:00:43.190> are<00:00:43.310> pretty<00:00:43.580> much<00:00:43.700> weapons<00:00:44.150> which

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
weapons are pretty much weapons which

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.310 
weapons are pretty much weapons which
provide<00:00:44.870> power<00:00:45.670> now<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.150> power<00:00:47.390> allows<00:00:48.140> you

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
provide power now the power allows you

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.980 
provide power now the power allows you
to<00:00:48.470> deal<00:00:48.620> more<00:00:48.830> damage<00:00:48.890> over<00:00:49.610> time<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:50.870> will

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
to deal more damage over time so it will

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.450 
to deal more damage over time so it will
allow<00:00:51.200> you<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.440> kill<00:00:51.680> things<00:00:51.920> quicker<00:00:52.220> at

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
allow you to kill things quicker at

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.210 
allow you to kill things quicker at
lower<00:00:52.670> levels<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:54.200> can<00:00:54.530> just<00:00:54.890> get<00:00:55.100> on
