00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
the diesel engine and that's not

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.370 
the diesel engine and that's not
surprising<00:01:51.370> but<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:52.270> little<00:01:52.870> extra<00:01:53.140> sound

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380

damping I can really hear the engine a

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
lot especially in first gear pickup but

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.890 
lot especially in first gear pickup but

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
that's the one big negative for me that

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.680 
that's the one big negative for me that
it's<00:02:02.320> very<00:02:02.530> obvious<00:02:03.010> diesel<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.300> lot<00:02:04.600> of
