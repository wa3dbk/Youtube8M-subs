00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.230 
this out and it comes out like I said a
pretty<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.760> ways<00:02:11.940> they

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
pretty good bit of a ways they

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.460 
pretty good bit of a ways they
um<00:02:15.280> yeah<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:17.240> went<00:02:17.930> ahead<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.200> put<00:02:18.350> some

um yeah so I went ahead and put some

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
um yeah so I went ahead and put some
MSF's<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.280> here<00:02:19.490> since<00:02:19.730> they're<00:02:19.910> fairly<00:02:20.180> large

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and you can see approximately what it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.080 
and you can see approximately what it
holds<00:02:24.320> but<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.370> holds<00:02:25.930> 12<00:02:26.930> MSF's<00:02:27.740> full<00:02:28.430> MSF's

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
want to double stack it will definitely

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.360 
want to double stack it will definitely
fit<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.770> that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
fit like that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.050 
fit like that
also<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.660> next<00:04:26.690> drawer<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.500> mainly<00:04:28.370> put<00:04:28.790> I

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
also so the next drawer I mainly put I

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.270 
also so the next drawer I mainly put I
shadows<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.780> quite<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> bit<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.440> things<00:04:33.740> but

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
shadows it's quite a bit of things but

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.250 
shadows it's quite a bit of things but
you<00:04:34.580> know<00:04:34.699> these<00:04:34.910> are<00:04:34.970> ones<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.080> would

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
you know these are ones that I would

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.710 
you know these are ones that I would
like<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:36.710> know<00:04:36.889> not<00:04:37.699> stacked<00:04:38.120> upon<00:04:38.300> one

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
like you know not stacked upon one

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.330 
like you know not stacked upon one
another<00:04:38.750> especially<00:04:39.169> like<00:04:39.710> these<00:04:39.949> two<00:04:40.190> right

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
another especially like these two right

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.120 
another especially like these two right
here<00:04:40.660> these<00:04:41.660> are<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.139> mat<00:04:42.440> quads<00:04:42.740> and

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
here these are just the mat quads and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.430 
here these are just the mat quads and
then<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> Milani<00:04:43.729> ones<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.270> did<00:04:44.600> throw<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.229> this

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
then the Milani ones I did throw in this

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680 
then the Milani ones I did throw in this
little<00:04:45.740> blush<00:04:46.340> over<00:04:46.820> here<00:04:47.060> or<00:04:47.270> these<00:04:47.419> two

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
little blush over here or these two

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.320 
little blush over here or these two
blushes<00:04:48.139> just<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.979> guys<00:04:49.070> can<00:04:49.130> see<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:50.120> it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
blushes just so you guys can see that it

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.900 
blushes just so you guys can see that it
will<00:04:50.510> fit<00:04:50.540> if<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.620> look<00:04:51.800> over<00:04:51.949> here<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.550> looks

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
will fit if you look over here it looks

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.890 
will fit if you look over here it looks
a<00:04:53.090> little<00:04:53.240> bit<00:04:53.479> overlapped<00:04:54.080> on<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.900> this

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
a little bit overlapped on the on this

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.980 
a little bit overlapped on the on this
part<00:04:57.169> but<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.680> still<00:04:58.039> does<00:04:58.340> close<00:04:58.940> so<00:04:59.780> there's

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
part but it still does close so there's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.020 
part but it still does close so there's
still<00:05:00.110> room<00:05:00.470> as<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.190> see<00:05:01.490> there's<00:05:01.789> no

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
still room as you can see there's no

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.779 
still room as you can see there's no
problem<00:05:02.539> closing<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.130> can<00:05:04.550> actually

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
problem closing it so you can actually

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.700 
problem closing it so you can actually
double<00:05:05.330> stack<00:05:05.810> blushes<00:05:06.560> also<00:05:07.190> in<00:05:07.430> these

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
double stack blushes also in these

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.409 
double stack blushes also in these
smaller<00:05:09.710> drawers<00:05:10.070> right<00:05:10.400> here<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:11.090> that's<00:05:11.270> a

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
smaller drawers right here so that's a

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.540 
smaller drawers right here so that's a
good<00:05:11.570> thing<00:05:11.630> if<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.440> have<00:05:12.620> tons<00:05:12.979> of<00:05:13.130> blushes

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
good thing if you have tons of blushes

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.370 
good thing if you have tons of blushes
and<00:05:13.699> you<00:05:13.789> want<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.030> storm<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.570> away<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.350> that

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
and you want to storm that away so that

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.279 
and you want to storm that away so that
is<00:05:16.160> that<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.940> then<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.570> really<00:05:17.900> like<00:05:18.050> this

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
is that and then I really like this

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.670 
is that and then I really like this
drawer<00:05:18.590> down<00:05:18.830> here<00:05:19.160> it's<00:05:19.340> pretty<00:05:19.840> wide<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.260> want

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
drawer down here it's pretty wide I want

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.670 
drawer down here it's pretty wide I want
to<00:05:21.770> say<00:05:21.919> it's<00:05:22.070> about<00:05:22.310> three<00:05:22.760> inches<00:05:23.180> maybe

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
to say it's about three inches maybe

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.589 
to say it's about three inches maybe
deep<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.979> I<00:05:25.699> actually<00:05:26.300> filled<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.139> with<00:05:27.169> my

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
deep and I actually filled it with my

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.930 
deep and I actually filled it with my
NYX<00:05:29.599> palettes<00:05:30.349> because<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:31.070> actually<00:05:31.250> had<00:05:31.789> them

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
NYX palettes because I actually had them

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.629 
NYX palettes because I actually had them
in<00:05:32.180> these<00:05:32.810> other<00:05:33.139> containers<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.130> these<00:05:34.340> we

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
in these other containers and these we

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.719 
in these other containers and these we
all<00:05:34.760> know<00:05:34.940> they're<00:05:35.150> not<00:05:35.180> durable<00:05:35.930> well<00:05:36.860> they

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
all know they're not durable well they

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.180 
all know they're not durable well they
may<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.120> but<00:05:38.599> they<00:05:39.080> don't<00:05:39.289> hold<00:05:39.530> all<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.950> stuff

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
may be but they don't hold all the stuff

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.670 
may be but they don't hold all the stuff
that<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:40.400> wanted<00:05:40.639> to<00:05:40.849> hold<00:05:41.120> so<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.870> guess<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:42.590> a

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
that I wanted to hold so I guess it's a

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.580 
that I wanted to hold so I guess it's a
little<00:05:42.710> bit<00:05:43.010> my<00:05:43.190> fault<00:05:43.460> but<00:05:44.090> um<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:45.110> pallets

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
little bit my fault but um the pallets

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.940 
little bit my fault but um the pallets
the<00:05:45.800> full<00:05:45.979> pilots<00:05:46.370> are<00:05:46.910> about<00:05:47.150> this<00:05:47.330> size<00:05:47.950> so

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
the full pilots are about this size so

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.620 
the full pilots are about this size so
you<00:05:48.979> stand<00:05:49.340> them<00:05:49.520> up<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:49.970> there's<00:05:50.330> pretty

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
you stand them up and there's pretty

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.650 
you stand them up and there's pretty
much<00:05:51.910> leaves<00:05:52.910> you<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.060> little<00:05:53.270> bit<00:05:53.389> of<00:05:53.479> more

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
much leaves you a little bit of more

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.409 
much leaves you a little bit of more
room<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.669> you<00:05:55.669> get<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:55.880> drift

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.050 

and<00:06:01.419> you<00:06:01.659> see<00:06:01.900> how<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.500> stack<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:03.219> on<00:06:03.430> top<00:06:03.819> and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
and you see how I stack this on top and

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.580 
and you see how I stack this on top and
there's<00:06:04.240> still<00:06:04.509> a<00:06:04.539> little<00:06:04.659> bit<00:06:04.840> more<00:06:05.169> room<00:06:05.349> and

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
there's still a little bit more room and

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.450 
there's still a little bit more room and
it<00:06:06.400> still<00:06:06.789> closes<00:06:07.360> pretty<00:06:07.990> well<00:06:08.259> so<00:06:08.979> that<00:06:09.219> just

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
it still closes pretty well so that just
