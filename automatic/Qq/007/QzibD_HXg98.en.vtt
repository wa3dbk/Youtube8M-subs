side<00:01:08.580> grass<00:01:08.939> texture<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> fastest

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
side grass texture and it's the fastest

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
side grass texture and it's the fastest
so<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> also<00:01:11.520> tells<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
graphics faster and then we have fast in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
graphics faster and then we have fast in
