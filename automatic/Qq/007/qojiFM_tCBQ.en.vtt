00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.269
 channel and welcome one and he and he 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 I'm here in a new video and as you see 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.420
 it's a little information video this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 is a video information for the live 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.690
 what will I do next and make this video 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 because it's not a normal direct but 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 it will be a special live and I would like 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.779
 tell everyone so you are good 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 a little bit prepared and six conscious 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 what we are going to do in the live 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 tonight as you see guys are missing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 six hundred peak subscribers for 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 200,000 and although they are enough I have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 the hope of arriving on the day of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 today I think so, so if we get there 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
 or good we will stay very close but 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.950
 good for that reason he decided to organize this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.379
 small direct then to the night in the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 which then I will play with you 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.540
 mainly to minecraft and now 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 explain a little bit what we will do and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.750
 we will play in premium in non-premium in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 Both of you I'll tell you a little bit but 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.379
 well let's start with parts in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 first place guys let's tell you the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.879
 time and is that the direct will be at 11 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.989
 of the Spanish time night you can if not 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.090
 you know the time of your country is very 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 simple you just have the video of the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 direct in the description and vice if you see 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.640
 how good will he put what remains so that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 get up there will be three 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 hours at the time I'm 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.240
 watching this video so it's just 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.820
 when the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
 regressive when that which puts in about 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.520
 numbers that go down when that account 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.020
 get to zero will start the direct 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 then do the calculations of how many 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 hours remain with respect to your country 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.060
 more or less worth it but as I say that the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 Spanish solution one hour a little bit 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.039
 late for Spain but good that either 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 is not bad to do a live like that 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.009
 I think that's fine too 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 styles guys that is direct to 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.189
 nothing is a special simply is a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 direct good as well as it says in the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.259
 title to the 200 thousand charm and is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.700
 so nothing all perfect after 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.350
 we will do good the main thing of the direct 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 it will be that we will be when an hour in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 premium servers and another hour in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 non-premium servers or this is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 Attention, well, well, I want to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
 I can play with all of you and I know that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 some do not have prizes not you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.090
 Worry about the live one will be two hours 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.619
 and the first hour will be in premium and the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.720
 Second hour will be in non premium 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.429
 I just hope so so that I do not 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.409
 there is no problem for all 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.240
 can play all and can play with the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.709
 as many people as possible and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.390
 also guys now yes yes I 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.679
 I would like to ask you a small favor this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 video if you do not want no need to 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.009
 I say a lot of support, although I know that a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 beats are always appreciated but you see 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.100
 to direct and supports it and above all 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
 while we are live that what 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.269
 share with your friends why 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.159
 this live is to try to get to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.510
 the large number the 200,000 subscribers 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.780
 that really is something that makes me 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.790
 very many illusion so nothing 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.950
 guys and more one of said this I tell you 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.569
 that we will play those mini games and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 We're not going to have a great time 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.340
 we will play mini games as we go 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.840
 Suddenly a serious survival or a trip 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.310
 that is, it depends but we are going to 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.439
 to have a great time together is going to be a 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 great night especially so what was said 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.469
 you have the streaming link in the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.359
 description please 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.829
 go over and support it with your like that 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.629
 start when the account will reach zero 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.680
 because I know there are a lot of people that seem 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.819
 very obvious because he realizes the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.319
 screen but a lot of people once I 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.209
 questions when it starts and sometimes it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.470
 Tired even to wait so not him 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.810
 have to start when the account 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.400
 regressive reach zero so said 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.079
