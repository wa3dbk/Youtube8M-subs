because<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.230> another<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> ways

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
because that's another one of the ways

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.349 
because that's another one of the ways
that<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.789> use<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.650> foil<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:29.970> just

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that you can use the foil with so i just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
that you can use the foil with so i just
cut<00:00:30.570> these<00:00:30.720> strips<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.560> three<00:00:32.130> quarters

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
cut these strips down to three quarters

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.410 
cut these strips down to three quarters
of<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.790> inch<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:33.620> 4<00:00:34.620> inches<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:36.180> i'm

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
of an inch by 4 inches and then i'm

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 
of an inch by 4 inches and then i'm
taking<00:00:36.450> won<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.770> backing<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.640> side<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
taking won the backing off one side and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
taking won the backing off one side and
then<00:00:39.600> sticking<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.379> strips<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> piece

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
then sticking the strips on to a piece

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.020 
then sticking the strips on to a piece
of<00:00:41.550> black<00:00:42.149> card<00:00:42.629> stack<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.489> i'm<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
of black card stack and i'm going to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
of black card stack and i'm going to
apply<00:00:45.180> four<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:45.960> strips<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> there

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
apply four of these strips on to there

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520 
apply four of these strips on to there
so<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.640> lining<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.690> kind

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so I'm just lining them up and I'm kind

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.200 
so I'm just lining them up and I'm kind
of<00:00:49.620> eyeballing<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.640> spacing<00:00:51.090> between<00:00:51.239> them

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
of eyeballing the spacing between them

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
of eyeballing the spacing between them
so<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.680> strip<00:00:56.219> left

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so as you can see I have one strip left

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.869 
so as you can see I have one strip left
to<00:00:56.910> apply<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:59.340> will<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to apply there and then these will be

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.860 
to apply there and then these will be
really<00:01:00.359> sticky<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.829> apply<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.850> foil<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really sticky and I can apply my foil to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.190 
really sticky and I can apply my foil to
those<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:05.180> when<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.240> use<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> sticky<00:01:06.930> embossing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
those I when I use the sticky embossing

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.410 
those I when I use the sticky embossing
powder<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.950> notice<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
powder you notice that not all of it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.039 
powder you notice that not all of it
stuck<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
stuck that well to it but this is a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.710 
stuck that well to it but this is a
completely<00:01:13.590> different<00:01:14.040> result<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.509> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
completely different result so I'm going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.630 
completely different result so I'm going
to<00:01:15.750> take<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.110> foil<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> line<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.610> up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to take my foil and kind of line that up

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
to take my foil and kind of line that up
just<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> edge<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
just so that it's on the edge and that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.539 
just so that it's on the edge and that
way<00:01:19.590> I'm<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.920> wasting<00:01:20.189> any<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.330> foil<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
way I'm not wasting any of my foil so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
way I'm not wasting any of my foil so
I'm<00:01:23.640> sticking<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.659> place<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I'm sticking that down into place and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.420 
I'm sticking that down into place and
then<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.250> take<00:01:26.520> my<00:01:26.759> bone<00:01:27.330> folder<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.110> just

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
then I will take my bone folder and just

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.330 
then I will take my bone folder and just
rub<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.820> over<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> will

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
rub it all over that and then that will

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
rub it all over that and then that will
make<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.299> foil<00:01:33.750> stick<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.159> adhesive<00:01:38.630> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
make that foil stick to the adhesive you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.469 
make that foil stick to the adhesive you
can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> actually<00:01:41.310> comes<00:01:41.670> off<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can see it kind of actually comes off a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
can see it kind of actually comes off a
lot<00:01:42.720> easier<00:01:42.990> than<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> sticky

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
lot easier than it with the sticky

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
lot easier than it with the sticky
embossing<00:01:44.310> powder<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> was<00:01:45.780> done<00:01:45.960> then

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
embossing powder so when I was done then

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.170 
embossing powder so when I was done then
I<00:01:46.259> lifted<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.850> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I lifted that up and you get that really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.039 
I lifted that up and you get that really
gorgeous<00:01:48.689> foil<00:01:49.470> shine<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.240> stuck<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.810> lot

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
gorgeous foil shine and it stuck a lot

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
gorgeous foil shine and it stuck a lot
better<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> sticky

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
better than it did to the sticky

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
better than it did to the sticky
embossing<00:01:54.390> powder<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.500> I'd<00:01:55.799> consider<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
embossing powder so I'd consider this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.569 
embossing powder so I'd consider this
way<00:01:56.880> uh<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.770> clean<00:01:59.159> image

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
way uh you get a more clean image

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
way uh you get a more clean image
whereas<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> sticky<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.229> bossy<00:02:01.500> powder

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
whereas with the sticky and bossy powder

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.550 
whereas with the sticky and bossy powder
it<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.180> vintage<00:02:03.560> antiquey

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it was more of like a vintage antiquey

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.600 
it was more of like a vintage antiquey
foiled<00:02:05.100> look<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:07.039> it's<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.489> both

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
foiled look so it's good for both

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
foiled look so it's good for both
purposes<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.170> depending<00:02:10.560> on

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
purposes because you know depending on

this<00:02:17.310> foil<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.299> see<00:02:18.450> myself<00:02:18.599> using

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
this foil and I can see myself using

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.890 
this foil and I can see myself using
this<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.549> adhesive<00:02:21.239> more<00:02:21.510> than<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
this with the adhesive more than the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500 
this with the adhesive more than the
sticky<00:02:22.290> embossing<00:02:22.560> powder<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.299> really<00:02:24.299> want<00:02:24.450> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
sticky embossing powder I really want to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.110 
sticky embossing powder I really want to
try<00:02:24.860> putting<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.129> adhesive<00:02:26.700> down<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> sheet

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
try putting the adhesive down on a sheet

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.839 
try putting the adhesive down on a sheet
of<00:02:27.299> paper<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.959> then<00:02:28.260> applying<00:02:28.980> my<00:02:29.220> foil<00:02:29.489> and

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
of paper and then applying my foil and

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.670 
of paper and then applying my foil and
then<00:02:29.940> die<00:02:30.299> cutting<00:02:30.599> out<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.200> which<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:31.500> think

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
then die cutting out of it which I think

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.619 
then die cutting out of it which I think
would<00:02:31.769> be<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.280> cool<00:02:32.730> look<00:02:32.940> as<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:33.360> so

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
would be a really cool look as well so

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.170 
would be a really cool look as well so
you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:34.230> word<00:02:34.470> dies<00:02:34.799> or<00:02:35.250> anything

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
you can do like word dies or anything

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.119 
you can do like word dies or anything
like<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.140> possibilities<00:02:38.099> are

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
like that just the possibilities are

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.699 
like that just the possibilities are
truly<00:02:38.340> endless<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.690> way<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.140> don't<00:02:40.440> have

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
truly endless in this way you don't have

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.860 
truly endless in this way you don't have
to<00:02:40.859> invest<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.670> laminator<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.480> another

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
to invest in a laminator or another

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.250 
to invest in a laminator or another
printer<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.980> foiled<00:02:44.400> look<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:46.200> I'm

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
printer to get that foiled look so I'm

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.660 
printer to get that foiled look so I'm
just<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> keep<00:02:46.739> applying<00:02:47.099> those<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.549> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
just going to keep applying those to the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.869 
just going to keep applying those to the
other<00:02:47.849> two<00:02:48.209> strips<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.349> then<00:02:50.159> once<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.519> finish

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
other two strips and then once I finish

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.270 
other two strips and then once I finish
up<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.450> will<00:02:52.019> have<00:02:52.260> my<00:02:52.650> background<00:02:55.099> so<00:02:56.099> go<00:02:56.220> ahead

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
up I will have my background so go ahead

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.500 
up I will have my background so go ahead
and<00:02:56.430> lift<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.849> up<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.299> there's<00:02:57.450> a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and lift that up and then there's a

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
and lift that up and then there's a
little<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.989> left<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.470> my<00:02:59.340> foil<00:02:59.609> sheet<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.090> i

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
little bit left on my foil sheet so i

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.819 
little bit left on my foil sheet so i
can<00:03:00.299> use<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.959> different<00:03:01.230> project<00:03:01.409> but

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
stamped and played around with it but I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.869 
stamped and played around with it but I
didn't<00:03:25.019> actually<00:03:25.109> use<00:03:25.319> em<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.949> a<00:03:26.010> card<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.730> this

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
didn't actually use em on a card so this

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.789 
didn't actually use em on a card so this
is<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> first<00:03:27.389> time<00:03:27.540> i'll<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.870> using<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.620> for

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
is the first time i'll be using it for

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.580 
is the first time i'll be using it for
that<00:03:29.449> so<00:03:30.449> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.079> there's<00:03:31.260> three

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that so you can see there's three

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
that so you can see there's three
different<00:03:31.769> separate<00:03:32.760> ink<00:03:33.030> pads<00:03:33.359> in<00:03:33.720> what<00:03:33.870> you

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
different separate ink pads in what you

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.500 
different separate ink pads in what you
want<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:35.549> ink<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.329> kind

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
want to do is just ink that up and kind

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.369 
want to do is just ink that up and kind
of<00:03:36.599> move<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.989> slightly<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.919> down<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.370> your

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
of move it slightly up and down on your

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.960 
of move it slightly up and down on your
block<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.680> way<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.040> helps<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.669> colors

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
block that way it just helps the colors

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.670 
block that way it just helps the colors
blend<00:03:42.299> together<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:42.989> don't<00:03:43.169> get<00:03:43.440> just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
blend together and you don't get just

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.460 
blend together and you don't get just
like<00:03:43.859> three<00:03:44.280> different<00:03:44.970> colors<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.959> makes<00:03:46.230> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
like three different colors it makes it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.789 
like three different colors it makes it
truly<00:03:46.980> more<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.459> an<00:03:47.579> ombre<00:03:48.030> look<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:49.680> i'm

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
truly more of an ombre look so then i'm

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.129 
truly more of an ombre look so then i'm
stamping<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.430> down<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.940> then<00:03:51.000> i<00:03:51.840> went<00:03:51.989> ahead

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
stamping that down and then i went ahead

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.530 
stamping that down and then i went ahead
and<00:03:52.349> fussy<00:03:53.040> cut<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.400> image<00:03:53.730> out<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:54.269> looks<00:03:54.449> a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and fussy cut that image out it looks a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.509 
and fussy cut that image out it looks a
little<00:03:54.660> splotchy<00:03:55.109> now<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> will<00:03:55.980> smooth

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
little splotchy now but it will smooth

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
into a ball in my fist and then place it

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.640

secure it into place and then you won't
even<00:04:34.600> see<00:04:34.870> those<00:04:35.020> staples<00:04:35.500> because<00:04:35.919> my
