for a run after the gym and I was

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
for a run after the gym and I was

would be a good opportunity for us to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910 
would be a good opportunity for us to
talk<00:00:25.769> about<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.670> current<00:00:27.000> sort<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.689> diet<00:00:28.349> setup

to have like maximal fat loss this is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
to have like maximal fat loss this is

this<00:00:43.110> night<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> pretty<00:00:43.890> low<00:00:44.129> carb<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.700> feel

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
this night is pretty low carb I feel

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.639 
this night is pretty low carb I feel
like<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.300> function<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> low<00:00:46.379> carb

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like I function pretty well in low carb

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.229 
like I function pretty well in low carb
I<00:00:46.739> generally<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.160> good<00:00:47.280> energy<00:00:47.370> for

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I generally have good energy for

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.410 
I generally have good energy for
training<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> fat<00:00:50.489> loss<00:00:50.670> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
training and I see a lot of fat loss but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.340 
training and I see a lot of fat loss but
it's<00:00:51.539> still<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.840> something<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> want

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it's still not something that you want

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
it's still not something that you want
to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> real<00:00:53.370> long<00:00:53.610> time<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.600> honestly

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to do for a real long time but honestly

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
to do for a real long time but honestly
the<00:00:55.379> diet<00:00:55.770> doesn't<00:00:56.070> end<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.340> being<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.760> super

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the diet doesn't end up being like super

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
the diet doesn't end up being like super
low<00:00:57.539> carb<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.680> still<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.219> carbs

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
low carb because I still get some carbs

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
low carb because I still get some carbs
from<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> vegetables<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> especially<00:01:01.050> like

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
from the vegetables and especially like

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
from the vegetables and especially like
carrots<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.770> stuff<00:01:01.980> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> high<00:01:02.399> carb<00:01:02.699> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
carrots and stuff kind of high carb but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
carrots and stuff kind of high carb but
um<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.080> eating<00:01:04.409> any<00:01:04.619> any<00:01:05.189> grains

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
um I'm not really eating any any grains

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
um I'm not really eating any any grains
or<00:01:06.240> any<00:01:06.479> stars<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.960> anything<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
or any stars or anything like that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.890 
or any stars or anything like that
and<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.100> helps<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> cut<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.720> body

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and that helps me to cut that on body

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
and that helps me to cut that on body
faster<00:01:10.260> than<00:01:10.439> I've<00:01:10.530> learned<00:01:10.770> over<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> years

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
faster than I've learned over the years

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
faster than I've learned over the years
but<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> experiment<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
but you're gonna have to experiment and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.710 
but you're gonna have to experiment and
find<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.310> works<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.790> uh<00:01:14.850> mmm<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
find out what works for you but uh mmm I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
find out what works for you but uh mmm I
did<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> show<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:16.950> doing<00:01:17.159> for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
did want to show you what I'm doing for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
did want to show you what I'm doing for
right<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.330> gonna<00:01:18.479> show<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.750> my

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
right now I'm not gonna show you like my

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
right now I'm not gonna show you like my
whole<00:01:19.049> days<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.560> eating<00:01:20.000> necessarily<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
whole days of eating necessarily but I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
whole days of eating necessarily but I
will<00:01:21.420> essentially<00:01:21.750> show<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> everything<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
will essentially show you everything I

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.740 
will essentially show you everything I
eat<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> day<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.509> really

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
eat for the day because I only really

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
eat for the day because I only really
eat<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:24.990> two<00:01:25.170> different<00:01:25.439> kinds<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.009> meals

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
eat like two different kinds of meals

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
eat like two different kinds of meals
but<00:01:26.909> um<00:01:27.060> essentially<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> guess<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.409> get

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but um essentially so I guess I get

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
but um essentially so I guess I get
started<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.100> um<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.670> I'd<00:01:30.119> rather<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.540> my

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
started what um what I'd rather start my

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.830 
started what um what I'd rather start my
day<00:01:30.689> off<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:32.299> recently<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.450> least<00:01:33.479> I've

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
day off with is recently at least I've

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
day off with is recently at least I've
been<00:01:34.020> doing<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> guess<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> first

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
been doing um well I guess the first

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.190 
been doing um well I guess the first
things<00:01:36.750> first

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
things first

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
things first
I<00:01:37.290> guess<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.590> start<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.829> day<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
I guess I start my day off with a

going to be this so I will have one sir
I<00:03:49.280> will<00:03:49.489> have<00:03:49.549> probably<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.150> don't<00:03:50.239> know

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
I will have probably I don't know

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.319 
I will have probably I don't know
probably<00:03:50.780> 12<00:03:51.230> ounces<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.769> chicken<00:03:51.980> or<00:03:52.639> some

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.690 
probably 12 ounces of chicken or some
sort<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.569> meat<00:03:53.780> but<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.859> not<00:03:55.069> 12<00:03:55.340> ounces
