00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.110
 Moscow, April 8 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.170
 on passing under the crossbar after 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 female 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.889
 which automatically turns from 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.299
 the creator of the quiz spouses so 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.549
 it is our shadow complex 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.310
 we have a complex 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.909
 very successful compilation of ideas 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.169
 of such for example as super tax mitrovitsy 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.289
 research 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.779
 and even if it is a contra game built on 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.869
 engine online wife 3 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.349
 all the experts in a peaceful way while she 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.010
 very cleverly treats his 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.140
 in triple difference in 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 most of the shadow complex remains 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 classic two-dimensional of course 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.020
 Russian trench to be investigated 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.039
 huge base of their terrorists 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.620
 with a bunch of committed 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 with these alternative options getting into 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.180
 rooms happen nice bonuses 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.670
 which 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.950
 mined by only three definitely 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.530
 weapons 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.199
 with all sorts of upgrades having not 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.410
 Is it easier to attribute but with 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.960
 there are moments when 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600
 comprehensively and west 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.740
 before and at all 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.840
 here with a flowers engine that is, we 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 ran ran along the plane left 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.090
 right saw turret stalin took 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.579
 pilot games suddenly 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.159
 turned into a third-person shooter 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.850
 let them stationary or for example a 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 in Prague are beginning to blame not only 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 i.e. culture decorations from the audience 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.430
 it all looks absolutely magical 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.240
 causes from two positive emotions 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.340
 Iran has some of its own 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.280
 indescribable magic that sort of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.380
 how do we play such a pichugin winds 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.900
 action adventure but he 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.520
 how was this very conditional project 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 at the base I am very far 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.310
 then automatism from the crater precisely because 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.539
 this i considered complex bloomed 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.369
 detachment precisely in terms of the leader 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.630
 used very 3 game about very 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.400
 beautiful 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.860
 that is, everything and this project could calmly 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.750
 go down on the discs people would buy 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.900
 one of it is normal money and and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.540
 all were satisfied here everything is very 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.430
 cool model characters their not 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.610
 afraid to show near her bronze 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.110
 the rates are the only gripe that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.800
 cause the game is animation all animation 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.920
 made manual from behind this place she 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.159
 looks good for example 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.329
 times prices when occurs 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.349
 melee between 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.939
 and no enemies in places and for example in 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.560
 time 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.459
 swimming jumps with the same screensavers 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.610
 Oleg the mudrak you can see what he did to all this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.489
 hands she managed to find it suitable 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.730
 saw very realistic 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.739
 but with all this the decorations themselves account 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.120
 cool there I do not know I judge how clarity 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 melting water in general is magical to me 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.049
 circles remain under water and everything floats 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.239
 the wings work as physics and in general everything 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.819
 very cool so can be short 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.960
 I'll tell you what is common to CSKA 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.580
 chateau complex so for example 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.870
 study of locations and fees grades to us 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.390
 came straight super and cover 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.300
 he even when we enter the steel supercar 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.559
 allowing you to run very fast 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.429
 estimated runaway countries 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:04.639
 once a year 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.939
 the metro is under direct citation due 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.779
 borrowing plagiarism but at the same time 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.919
 how the plagiarized cap is perceived from 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.659
 roes 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.599
 no it's 5 to 6 years old 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.760
 in short, plus pumping only prices if and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.480
 protocol goals 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.550
 it was clear what you pumped 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.220
 there it is pumped here a little bit 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.700
 recently that is, we get some 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.049
 broken came accuracy there characters 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.379
 increased but 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.129
 I personally put Bashar Asad behind bars 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.099
 so be it for everyone 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.469
 and shoots obkom trend 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.419
 got completely crazy and 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.449
 mad shootout with clouds of enemies who 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.469
 start to crawl her over all parts of the screen and 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.680
 excellent and nontrivial at times 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.709
 even in a duel with the bosses it was possible 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.969
 say that just called shot 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.139
 half an hour from the machine throw 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.319
 grenades but sometimes you need to apply 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.650
 docking as for example you need to do villages with 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.439
 Gup talka which regiment can 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.399
 make 5 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.829
 his joke is to see if uefa is on the sidewalk 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.579
 not even a fan of the retriever 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.680
 so that the complexes must be downloaded at least by 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.879
 one version look 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.049
 like it but instead of whom voted 300 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:10.869
 is available 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.730
 column 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.209
 a small part of the game 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.979
 urban money 1200 microsoft points of 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.579
 each of them 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.590
 of course everything is beautiful 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.530
 all play with fire at all interesting level 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.020
 bone so try maybe 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.850
 You'll like it
