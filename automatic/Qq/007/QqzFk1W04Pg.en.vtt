00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.790 

but<00:01:15.060> survival<00:01:15.540> depends<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:15.960> numbers<00:01:16.440> so

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
but survival depends on numbers so

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.070 
but survival depends on numbers so
someone<00:01:17.160> made<00:01:17.370> our<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.760> champs

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
someone made our little champs

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.550 
someone made our little champs
irresistible<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.350> opposite<00:01:19.770> sex<00:01:21.560> now

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
irresistible to the opposite sex now

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.040 
irresistible to the opposite sex now
we're<00:01:22.950> talking<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.910> mating<00:01:24.570> that's<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> case

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050

of<00:01:27.550> course<00:01:27.880> there's<00:01:28.150> strength<00:01:28.450> in<00:01:28.630> numbers

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
of course there's strength in numbers

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:38.340

but<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.560> strength<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.040> shop<00:01:30.370> weaponry<00:01:30.880> to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.390 

ironically<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.590> led<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.830> what<00:01:40.040> we<00:01:40.159> call

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
ironically this led to what we call

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.440 
ironically this led to what we call
civilization<00:01:42.220> but<00:01:43.220> civilization<00:01:43.640> meant<00:01:44.270> more

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
civilization but civilization meant more

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.560 
civilization but civilization meant more
competition<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:45.350> just<00:01:45.649> about<00:01:45.770> everything

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
competition for just about everything

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.999 
competition for just about everything
happily<00:01:47.570> someone<00:01:47.930> pulled<00:01:48.170> our<00:01:48.320> species<00:01:48.710> aside

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
happily someone pulled our species aside

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.950 
happily someone pulled our species aside
and<00:01:49.189> said<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.850> guys<00:01:50.030> need<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.330> chill<00:01:50.360> out<00:01:50.689> and

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.020 
starships and they set out to conquer
the<00:02:02.600> galaxy<00:02:04.360> but<00:02:05.360> what<00:02:05.539> they<00:02:05.720> never<00:02:05.990> realized
