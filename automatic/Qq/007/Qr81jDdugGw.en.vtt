00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.430
 Yes 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.740
 and god everyone I hope you 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.420
 have well and today we find ourselves 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.010
 in a new video of the clash of 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.880
 laurent so today we will talk about 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.950
 how to mount masters hdv 7 and 8 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.970
 or maybe nine but it's okay 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.760
 concern small hdv is just 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.310
 before playing down you say you have 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.770
 saw the new intro so I found 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 already more stylish then to say that ten 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.359
 second unlike the other who 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.219
 lasts 20 seconds and she was 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:44.329
 nice to watch one so was 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:52.010
 really boring to watch so cuckoo 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:55.089
 michel bravo jacky michel agree and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.329
 well bah thanks to thouars the cowboys 1 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.760
 so I will not give it a quick but 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.920
 at least the little tricks I 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.110
 know to mount master easily 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.750
 so I'm not a run pro but I 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.900
 may still be able to help you 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.670
 so firstly for hdv 7 and 8 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 so I'm going to talk to you especially 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.990
 if you want to laugh at master I'll 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.610
 advise you to put your hdv 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.800
 outside so why the outside 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.540
 because people are going to you 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.320
 attack that your hdv alone I am 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.710
 persuaded and you will lose 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.330
 kind five trophies instead of you 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.380
 take a three star that will you 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.320
 cost 15 trophies which I think so 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.680
 three times less trophy lost 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.800
 so that's it's all the same 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.570
 Goodbye after the technique of attac 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.330
 I advise you to snipe and the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.580
 rather long technical hdv 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.340
 and then very well known especially so that I 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.470
 do not think you're learning something 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.060
 where I advise you to do 50 % in 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.950
 archi barba good I know you have 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.000
 5 5 archers and barbaric and this HDV 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.680
 archer 4 and bars and barbarian 4 so that's 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.860
 not necessarily obvious that's why 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.060
 I advise you either your barbarian king 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.390
 or spells and phu tho and now 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.830
 so I have a little better explain for 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.290
 those who were not very good 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.269
 including the age of the exteriors is very 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.160
 simple in fact simply put 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.060
 his hdv outside to lose less 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.790
 of teachers is therefore usually 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.470
 you put your hdv outside vougay 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.660
 disconnected for 10 minutes 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.410
 we will go straight to attack your 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.850
 age had so everyone's going 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.120
 attacking your age was a priority 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.370
 especially bullets of the age snipers had to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.769
 and you will lose a star then 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.900
 that if you feel your hdd for 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.660
 the ages dv7 you do not necessarily have a 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.000
 hyper strong village hdv this sasp and m 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.640
 all quietly and so you go 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.230
 you take three stars it is better 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.670
 to take a star we are well 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.010
 okay even though his age of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.570
 outside is not done by all the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.340
 world and we can find it weird but 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.510
 it is a technique used by people 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.239
 to go in champion then after I 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.299
 advise you to make three attacks 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.760
 of connection so have the attacks of 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.260
 connection so when you log on 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.620
 clash of plant you arrive in a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.910
 session so login you play 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.950
 like half an hour I do not know 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.810
 a lot of disconnect reconnect you 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.670
 the next day and well the time that you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.470
 go connected it's called a 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.380
 session so there you 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.000
 in my opinion you already know all that and 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.450
 so while you are connected so 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.520
 the best part is to stay 45 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.220
 connected minutes so the time to do 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.290
 three barbarian archers attacks without 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.090
 to boost his barracks 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.410
 I think in meat and finally because 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.040
 like that it's profitable you did to 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 about five trophies per attac and 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.360
 since you lose only five trophies 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.100
 five trophies by attac do you 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.359
 three it's fifteen trophies you 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.100
 lose five trophies during 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.140
 disconnections that's ten trophies two 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.090
 bonus and so you win trophies 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.070
 per day it may be slow for 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.470
 some but like that you are sure 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.630
 to get master so it was a small 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.250
 video because I had been asked 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.510
 question here in the general one 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.130
 had asked me I had said that I 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.400
 would do a little video on it so 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.560
 only three tips snipe help hdv 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.360
 Barbarian archers to aim for 50% 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.480
 win trophies make three attacks 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.460
 in a in a connection so 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.130
 I hope this little video you 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.750
 will have pleased and helped you so you 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.370
 hdv 7 and 8 to mount master and me eh bah 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.770
 I tell you it rained in a next 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.890
 cash flow video tried him all the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.890
 world
