 growth you have experienced 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.030
 this festival good last year already 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.580
 they really showed muscle to start something 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.190
 like this is not easy last year 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.870
 were around 17,000 people this 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.510
 year on the second day according to comments 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.610
 the organization have already overcome that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 number with which I can only say that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.390
 It has been an absolutely resounding success 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 it's not easy to organize something like 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.690
 this this is what puts us know 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.090
 very well because we are fortunate 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.050
 travel and see other festivals and in the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 way in which you are projecting 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.950
 this the truth is that it looks like 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.989
 become something very big for 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.600
 we are a pleasure and an honor to be able 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.910
 support companies that do these things 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.739
 the more from the small heart 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.200
 because we are from Malaga this is done in 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.420
 Malaga and it really is something that we do not 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.890
 especially motivates in this edition 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.810
 we have also had the presence of 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.150
 11 lots this morning goodbye one 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 masterclass in which the capacity was for 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.209
 650 people and they stayed 100 in the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.760
 door 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.959
 Now we have another masterclass on 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.600
 about design comes our sun and 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.070
 designers víctor a new new signing 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.720
 what we have done in gozón comes 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.860
 directly from silicon valley well 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.780
 then you have to work with 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.590
 we will explain how it works 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.390
 this equal 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.060
 Larger you dismiss the organization 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.459
 that there are no tickets left with 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.800
 which resounding success so much for came 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.790
 polly as for us for button and the 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 true that we are very happy to 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.330
 be able to be here 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.160
 by nvidia sebastián and yearbook 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.870
 was with pc components telling us 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.610
 all the news about your new 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.610
 product envy and the tablet 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.350
 without a tablet is the last product of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.630
 nvidia is basically an android tablet 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.630
 but that carries the most advanced chip of the 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.900
 market actually takes a 7 v of 4 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.030
 nuclei plus one of 2.2 gigahertz but 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.730
 that does not want without nothing has a part 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.210
 interesting graphic what we did with 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.400
 the tablet is to carry the architecture of 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.800
 nvidia kepler which are the graphics of 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.060
 desk let's say the latest geforce 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.860
 gtx the titanic as well take the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.530
 architecture same thing but to a tablet 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.720
 what is interesting with no tablet is 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.080
 that we can play or games 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.270
 optimized for tegra k1 or a 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.720
 games directly in streaming from 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.880
 a pc and play them up to 1080p 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.550
 but on the tablet just like on a pc 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.280
 the one that is the same that can be in 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.950
 the office in a room whatever 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.080
 also interesting with the tablet is that 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.450
 comes with the ability to record 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.970
 gameplays and upload them to tweets that's 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.650
 quite important people see it as 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.529
 a tablet but the truth is a 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.629
 revolution 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.939
 that allows you to record gameplays 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.779
 directly on a tablet is crazy 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:45.119
 that all at 1080p without any problem of 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:48.179
 performance while you play obvious 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:51.149
 You play a half life 2 optimized at 1080p 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:54.059
 more than 40 images per second or 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:57.349
 you're playing the last whats down from 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.349
 your desktop PC 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.149
 I found the truth of envy 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.429
 is that what is in the market what 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.289
 better than it exists now it's true that by 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:15.029
 now there is still a lack of content to be able to 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.159
 explode to the maximum will only be 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.169
 online and few games left is bonus 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.080
 but for streaming and the rest is 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.089
 perfect awesome we already have a 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800
 device that is portable that is no longer 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.779
 you need are we are playing is 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.089
 center our sofa can already be in 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.069
 your own room in the yard at home 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.509
 of your water vapor level then for 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.159
 me the truth that is very simple and very 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.769
 practical and when taking everyone 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:40.019
 sides the portability that is what is 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:41.849
 fashionable today the thing to be worn 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.979
 the stable mobiles of more it was time that 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.979
 for gamers we also had something 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.259
 of spectacular portability 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.269
 awesome is a practical word and 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.139
 if I had to describe a word 

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:59.490
 entertained in good novelty very 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.749
 Complete and innovative and it is very well 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.749
 I think it's magnificent 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.250
 an event that enjoys very good health and 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.050
 that will have a great journey we are 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.340
 sure that next year you will see 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.340
 increased participation
