again<00:01:49.759> when<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.359> comes<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.689> viewing<00:01:50.930> angles

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
again when it comes to viewing angles

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.950 
again when it comes to viewing angles
the<00:01:52.100> redmi<00:01:52.399> 2<00:01:52.549> manages<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.180> edge<00:01:53.329> ahead<00:01:53.750> and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the redmi 2 manages to edge ahead and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.469 
the redmi 2 manages to edge ahead and
the<00:01:54.799> redmi<00:01:55.070> 2<00:01:55.189> is<00:01:55.250> also<00:01:55.520> brighter<00:01:56.000> meaning

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the redmi 2 is also brighter meaning

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.660 
the redmi 2 is also brighter meaning
it's<00:01:56.689> better<00:01:57.109> visible<00:01:57.530> outdoors<00:01:57.950> if<00:01:58.490> I'm
