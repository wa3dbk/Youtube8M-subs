00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 Alejandro for the first time, good afternoon 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.740
 good afternoon 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.080
 Then we talked about singing stopped the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.440
 intermediate of the run the first bull 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.660
 that has demanded I think I take care of it almost more 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.320
 the second that has not broken forward 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.150
 this has had that background until the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.040
 satisfied moment the truth that 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.380
 happy not in the afternoon has been missing 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.210
 more in everything not 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.800
 and I believe that with this bull of reached 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.730
 to the moments that I want as a bullfighter 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.760
 reducing it at a very nice rate to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.829
 me and also, well, very meaningful and very 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 tight not the truth that I'm very 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.430
 happy with the outside job 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.720
 We sensed that there could be surprises 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.269
 been the chiqueros door in the first 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.159
 bull that percent has spent a little while 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.379
 there because everything has doubted enough 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.479
 but then let's see how it is possible 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.899
 sing and we will treat you well you love 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.920
 buy bullfighting in front of the face of 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.799
 bull because there has also been a moment 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.350
 that was practically the beat of the 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.989
 are from the song when it's not the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.900
 I really like the beat 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.730
 by bulerÃ­a and 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.850
 in fact I think that bullfighting contains 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 that music what happens that many times 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 the artist who needs to sing stops 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.830
 that I go to buy many times to the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.140
 bullfighters sing us flamenco yes and it's not 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.640
 the same thing because you carry a script and without 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.610
 But as there I had the bull and 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.100
 I've felt and I've come out like this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.900
 the truth I had not prepared but I 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.130
 has come out we have spoken many times 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.560
 when I knew that you had to put a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.720
 little bit of chaos or disorder within 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.310
 this great order that is the world of the bull 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 I think the afternoon if he's having 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.990
 at least little dots of disorder and 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.210
 chaos that is greatly appreciated if even what 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.870
 of anti-bullfighting is funny 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.560
 the truth that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.110
 that there have been very special moments 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.579
 all the people in the square are 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.159
 satisfied and is living a 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.570
 very beautiful show hopefully invite 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.490
 the other texts of arms in the many 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.490
 thank you and continue to thank you
