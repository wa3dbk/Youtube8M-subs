00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
here this is a cadaverous night and i'm
not<00:00:36.930> sure<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> language<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
not sure what the language is but this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.459 
not sure what the language is but this
is<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.600> cadaverous<00:00:40.079> night<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:41.040> mirage<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
is a cadaverous night from mirage and

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
is a cadaverous night from mirage and
what<00:00:43.469> makes<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.920> card<00:00:44.250> interesting<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
what makes this card interesting is the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.500 
what makes this card interesting is the
fact<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.250> am<00:00:47.520> still<00:00:47.820> beer<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
fact that we have am still beer on the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
fact that we have am still beer on the
back<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.469> adds<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.980> whole<00:00:50.010> new<00:00:50.370> dimension

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
back so this adds a whole new dimension

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
back so this adds a whole new dimension
to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> phrase<00:00:51.449> called<00:00:51.719> drafting<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.860> have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and done very poorly so it kind of makes

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
and done very poorly so it kind of makes
me<00:01:54.570> wonder<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.470> truly<00:01:56.009> some<00:01:56.189> am

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
chant and the interesting thing too is

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.740 
chant and the interesting thing too is
because<00:02:08.950> these<00:02:09.130> cards<00:02:09.550> are<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.060> horribly<00:02:10.450> cut

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750

I<00:02:10.960> can<00:02:11.410> even<00:02:11.620> kind<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.190> tell<00:02:12.430> where<00:02:12.880> they<00:02:13.150> were

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
I can even kind of tell where they were

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.630 
I can even kind of tell where they were
on<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.720> sheet<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.650> funny<00:02:14.860> thing<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.100> if

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
on the sheet and the funny thing is if

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.790 
on the sheet and the funny thing is if
you<00:02:15.820> look<00:02:16.240> at<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.420> very<00:02:16.750> top<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.260> car<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you look at the very top of the car you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.410 
you look at the very top of the car you
can<00:02:17.950> see<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.490> little<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.940> white<00:02:19.120> here

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
can see just a little bit of white here

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.420 
can see just a little bit of white here
and<00:02:19.570> then<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.470> actually<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:21.220> the

now the thing about this is I really
told<00:02:39.280> no<00:02:39.640> whole<00:02:40.300> lot<00:02:40.600> about<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.140> history<00:02:41.320> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
told no whole lot about the history of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.350 
told no whole lot about the history of
these<00:02:41.770> cards<00:02:42.250> other<00:02:42.490> than<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.940> fact<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
these cards other than the fact that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.380 
these cards other than the fact that
these<00:02:43.620> made<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.980> public<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.730> with

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
these made it to the public with with

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.910 
these made it to the public with with
the<00:02:46.420> help<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:47.050> wizards<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> coast

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the help of a wizards of the coast

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.850 
the help of a wizards of the coast
employee<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.790> there<00:02:49.240> are<00:02:49.300> very<00:02:49.600> few<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.620> far

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
employee and there are very few so far

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.380 
employee and there are very few so far
as<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.070> know<00:02:51.130> there<00:02:51.490> are<00:02:51.520> six<00:02:51.850> different<00:02:52.060> ones

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
as I know there are six different ones

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.830 
as I know there are six different ones
and<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:54.100> only<00:02:54.370> thing<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:55.060> seems<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.540> make

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and the only thing that seems to make

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.230 
and the only thing that seems to make
some<00:02:56.230> reasonable<00:02:56.920> sense<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.460> this<00:02:57.640> card<00:02:58.000> is

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
some reasonable sense with this card is

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.560 
some reasonable sense with this card is
the<00:02:58.810> fact<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.250> cardi<00:03:00.250> Monday<00:03:00.580> they<00:03:01.300> make

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the fact that cardi Monday they make

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.050 
the fact that cardi Monday they make
they<00:03:02.350> make<00:03:02.500> other<00:03:02.680> things<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.370> regular

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
they make other things like regular

they make other things like regular
playing<00:03:04.390> cards<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.560> most<00:03:05.800> sensible<00:03:06.520> thing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
playing cards so the most sensible thing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.630 
playing cards so the most sensible thing
and<00:03:07.150> which<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.900> cannot<00:03:08.440> fully<00:03:08.830> back<00:03:09.100> up<00:03:09.370> but<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and which I cannot fully back up but the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.540 
and which I cannot fully back up but the
most<00:03:09.910> sensible<00:03:10.420> thing<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:11.020> at<00:03:11.350> one<00:03:12.070> point

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
most sensible thing is at one point

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.060 
most sensible thing is at one point
which<00:03:12.880> would<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.180> been<00:03:13.239> mid<00:03:13.750> mid<00:03:14.230> 90s<00:03:14.680> around

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
which would have been mid mid 90s around

which would have been mid mid 90s around
Mirage<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:16.270> were<00:03:16.330> actually<00:03:16.930> making<00:03:17.320> am

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
still beer playing cards again I can't

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.140 
still beer playing cards again I can't
be<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> hundred<00:03:22.630> percent<00:03:22.780> sure<00:03:23.080> about<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.620> but

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
be a hundred percent sure about that but

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.699 
be a hundred percent sure about that but
that<00:03:25.150> seems<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.600> be<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.720> only<00:03:25.870> logical

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
that seems to be the only logical

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.160 
that seems to be the only logical
conclusion<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.060> why<00:03:28.480> they<00:03:28.810> would<00:03:28.989> actually

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
conclusion as to why they would actually

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.010 
conclusion as to why they would actually
have<00:03:29.650> something<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:31.630> they

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
have something like that and then they

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.080 
have something like that and then they
just<00:03:32.350> for<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.680> hell<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.100> put<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.850> with<00:03:33.910> some

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
just for the hell of it put it with some

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.570 
just for the hell of it put it with some
