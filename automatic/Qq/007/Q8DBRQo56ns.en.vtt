00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 John Lasseter asked me for an idea 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 to develop computer games 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.800
 I thought that's a great world 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800
 to tell a story in it 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.859
 air is purely the knowledge closed 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.780
 we have four different worlds 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.520
 created

 so can speak 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.180
 and then there is the game centralstation 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.180
 they connect all worlds together 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.160
 to register something 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.510
 I hate that I often hear that 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.340

 are 80s 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.950
 There is a very simple one 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.400
 is from the design about the movements 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.750
 through to animation , the evil is the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.010
 I always want to break everything 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.010
 just not being angry anymore 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.020
 a rough game and very detailed 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.009
 Sugar rush even fast is a racing game 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.360

 mixed with japanese anime influence 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.270
 We took a lot of time to the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.450
 worlds really different too
