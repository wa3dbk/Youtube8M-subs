00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 your marching set of dishes and start here 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.070
 with this here it is an army sample 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 I have such a plastic bowl in it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.670
 is most of what i'm 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.850
 I use first to talk about what 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.460
 is inside then at the very bowl and 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.930
 so you already saw in one of the previous 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 video in a similar thing 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.640
 called spork only there she was 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.040
 collector's edition here is usually 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.040
 slightly unusual pink color in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.800
 principle so here it looks 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.629
 there is another such little thing you are 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.890
 also probably seen if you watched mine 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:59.430
 past video teaspoon so 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:01:04.460
 like a common tablespoon a bit 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 bent and what fit into this container 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:16.799
 it looks like this 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 like this here three appliance knife fork or 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.479
 spoon accordingly but i use 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.000
 only a spoon because because in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.380
 Basically, such 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.590
 the table knife and fork are not needed on the campaigns 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 besides, there are these things here and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:45.299
 ordinary knife any marching knife can 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 use as a table knife here is 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.770
 I have three kinds of spices sugar salt and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.770
 pepper and spices which I take with me 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.009
 such a bowl or rather a folding cup 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.890
 600 milliliters is very convenient 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.459
 fits in pocket side pocket 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.230
 pants 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:17.790
 Well of course in this bowl is not 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.690
 it is quite convenient to use here 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.840
 on the wall 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.620
 measured sands that is basically possible 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.890
 some group 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.680
 measure something liquid 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.250
 milliliters 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:41.950
 well here is a step of 100 milliliters extremely 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:45.069
 handy thing we go further myself this 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 here's a bowl of two parts this 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:52.750
 the lid and the bowl itself is naturally made 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.760
 from plastic that is to put on the fire 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.489
 impossible of course you can but she 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.700
 will melt 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.069
 on the cover there is a cutting board 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.060
 quite convenient that is, you can take 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.880
 cover cut something folded in a bowl 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.280
 or in the pan and thus cook 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.380
 food is one small minus it 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.010
 quite inconvenient to wash here in these 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:27.459
 especially in places it is often fat 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.269
 but in principle a very handy thing a lot 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.269
 just fit 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.010
 the next one on my list is a thermos bottle 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.230
 I'm so old already rumpled 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.230
 the thermostat is such a dent tangible but 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.280
 on his 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.160
 thermal insulation it does not affect 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.340
 that is, it also holds like a new thermos 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.340
 of the same kind 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:08.610
 written sunflower that is 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.440
 sunflower recommend such thermos on 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.320
 really very good thing if 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.130
 find buy don't think if 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.890
 you need a thermos 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:23.160
 naturally you will not regret 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.920
 Well, perhaps the last thing is another 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.490
 such a bowl is hanging on my 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.040
 backpack 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.700
 on the valve is also quite convenient 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.300
 plastic light there is also dimensional 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:45.570
 cutting in 50 milliliter increments of just 300 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:50.130
 milliliters is convenient for cooking 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.590
 food that is up to 50 with an accuracy of 50 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.010
 milliliters can measure anything 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.610
 whether it's cereal some kind of liquid something 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.910
 something else but again from it pretty 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.850
 conveniently and constantly at hand constantly 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.890
 backpack 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.090
 again made of plastic that is on 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.270
 I put a suit there are such things 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.740
 different colors 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:23.700
 eg Here is such a need to have these 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.810
 blue like this here is a bowl of green 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.140
 in principle, almost any color 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.840
 Here I have such an interesting such 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.519
 principle, no longer buy where this thing 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.979
 I was bought on 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:43.159
 between folk tales rally 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:46.249
 more precisely camp even if someone knows 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.929
 Volga Jimbore 22 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.259
 was last year here there such 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:55.039
 things were sold nowhere else 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:06:01.699
 saw well actually here this 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:04.129
