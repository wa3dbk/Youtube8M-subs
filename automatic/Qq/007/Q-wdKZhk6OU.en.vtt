is<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.460> much<00:01:45.640> evidence<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.329> for<00:01:46.810> many

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
is so much evidence here for many

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.989 
is so much evidence here for many
theories<00:01:47.799> many<00:01:48.100> different<00:01:48.460> things<00:01:48.579> I<00:01:48.789> want<00:01:48.939> to

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
theories many different things I want to

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.149 
theories many different things I want to
talk<00:01:49.149> about<00:01:49.299> them<00:01:49.569> individually<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.859> let's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
talk about them individually so let's

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.550 
talk about them individually so let's
start<00:01:51.340> off<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.409> fingerprints<00:01:53.409> at<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
start off with the fingerprints at the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.380 
start off with the fingerprints at the
top<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.399> page<00:01:54.609> if<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.060> look<00:01:55.240> at<00:01:55.359> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
top of the page if you look at the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.569 
top of the page if you look at the
fingerprints<00:01:56.020> there<00:01:56.619> there<00:01:57.189> are<00:01:57.340> two

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
fingerprints there there are two

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.039 
fingerprints there there are two
different<00:01:57.880> fingerprints<00:01:58.299> right<00:01:58.600> here<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
different fingerprints right here and

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.510 
different fingerprints right here and
one<00:01:59.100> of<00:02:00.100> them<00:02:00.219> says<00:02:00.520> no<00:02:00.850> match<00:02:01.060> found<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.829> I

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
one of them says no match found now I I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.129 
one of them says no match found now I I
have<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:03.969> feeling<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.539> one<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:05.079> these

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
have a feeling that one of these

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.289 
have a feeling that one of these
fingerprints<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.889> actually<00:02:06.249> Stanley<00:02:06.789> stands

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
fingerprints is actually Stanley stands

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.809 
fingerprints is actually Stanley stands
twin<00:02:07.749> and<00:02:08.020> there<00:02:08.770> are<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.310> many<00:02:09.399> theories

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
twin and there are so many theories

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.910 
twin and there are so many theories
about<00:02:09.970> Stan<00:02:10.390> having<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.110> twin<00:02:11.260> it's<00:02:11.650> like

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
about Stan having a twin it's like

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.030 
about Stan having a twin it's like
really<00:02:12.490> it's<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.799> good

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
really it's just it's a really good

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.350 
really it's just it's a really good
theory<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:16.260> also<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.799> see<00:02:18.099> right<00:02:18.640> right

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
theory and also if you see right right

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.160 
theory and also if you see right right
behind<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
behind the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.710 
behind the
Prince<00:02:20.470> there<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> map<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.490> it's<00:02:22.390> really

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
Prince there is a map and it's really

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.150 
Prince there is a map and it's really
hard<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.380> picture<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.890> gotta

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
hard to see in this picture you gotta

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.580 
hard to see in this picture you gotta
watch<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.300> actual<00:02:25.480> teaser<00:02:26.080> trailer

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
watch in the the actual teaser trailer

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
watch in the the actual teaser trailer
but<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.880> says<00:02:28.540> new<00:02:28.930> jay<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:31.450> new<00:02:31.810> jay

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
but it says new jay and that new jay

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.080 
but it says new jay and that new jay
actually<00:02:32.920> means<00:02:33.099> new<00:02:33.310> jersey<00:02:33.760> because<00:02:33.910> you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
actually means new jersey because you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
actually means new jersey because you
can<00:02:34.239> see<00:02:34.390> from<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> shape<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.080> state<00:02:35.430> that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
can see from the shape of the state that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.390 
can see from the shape of the state that
he's<00:02:36.760> from<00:02:37.000> New<00:02:37.150> Jersey<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:39.130> knew<00:02:39.370> that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
he's from New Jersey so we knew that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.040 
he's from New Jersey so we knew that
grunkle<00:02:39.760> Stan<00:02:40.060> was<00:02:40.180> from<00:02:40.330> New<00:02:40.450> Jersey<00:02:40.630> by<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
grunkle Stan was from New Jersey by the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.290 
grunkle Stan was from New Jersey by the
jersey<00:02:41.560> vultures<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.069> one<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> flashbacks

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
jersey vultures in one of the flashbacks

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.940 
jersey vultures in one of the flashbacks
of<00:02:43.510> dreamscape<00:02:44.020> herbs<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.739> just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
of dreamscape herbs but this just

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.610 
of dreamscape herbs but this just
basically<00:02:45.520> confirms<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.780> now<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.319> want<00:02:47.590> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
basically confirms it so now I want to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.650 
basically confirms it so now I want to
get<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.950> radioactive<00:02:48.760> barrel<00:02:49.150> stolen

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
get to the radioactive barrel stolen

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.050 
get to the radioactive barrel stolen
this<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:51.750> made<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.989> original<00:02:53.739> theory<00:02:54.130> they're

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
this is I made a original theory they're

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.850 
this is I made a original theory they're
like<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.630> my<00:02:55.780> channel<00:02:56.170> i<00:02:56.230> made<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.440> theory<00:02:56.739> that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
like on my channel i made a theory that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.610 
like on my channel i made a theory that
the<00:02:57.700> apocalypse<00:02:58.150> upcoming<00:02:59.080> was<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.500> be

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the apocalypse upcoming was going to be

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.039 
the apocalypse upcoming was going to be
nuclear<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.549> portal<00:03:00.970> was<00:03:01.510> actually

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
nuclear and the portal was actually

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.160 
nuclear and the portal was actually
powered<00:03:02.590> by<00:03:02.769> nuclear<00:03:02.980> power<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.900> is

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
powered by nuclear power and this is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.920 
powered by nuclear power and this is
basically<00:03:05.709> proving<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:06.850> grunkle<00:03:07.090> Stan<00:03:07.480> uses

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
basically proving that grunkle Stan uses

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.640 
basically proving that grunkle Stan uses
the<00:03:08.519> radioactive<00:03:09.519> barrels<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.780> actually<00:03:11.260> fuel

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the radioactive barrels to actually fuel

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.289 
the radioactive barrels to actually fuel
the<00:03:11.890> portal<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.120> really

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
the portal and this is really

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.090 
the portal and this is really
interesting<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.560> puts<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.920> whole<00:03:15.069> new

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
interesting because it puts a whole new

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860 
interesting because it puts a whole new
perspective<00:03:15.549> on<00:03:15.910> what's<00:03:16.150> coming<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.569> what's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
perspective on what's coming up what's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.320 
perspective on what's coming up what's
going<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.110> happen<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:17.950> apocalypse<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.670> I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
going to happen in the apocalypse and I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.390 
going to happen in the apocalypse and I
just<00:03:19.540> think<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.049> was<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:20.560> cool<00:03:20.830> how

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
just think that it was really cool how

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.030 
just think that it was really cool how
that's<00:03:21.640> actually<00:03:22.060> happening<00:03:22.209> now<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.900> as<00:03:23.860> you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
that's actually happening now and as you

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.300 
that's actually happening now and as you
see<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.459> says<00:03:24.730> seismic<00:03:25.359> activity<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.290> we<00:03:27.130> know

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
see it says seismic activity and we know

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.880 
see it says seismic activity and we know
this<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.790> portal<00:03:28.269> shaking<00:03:29.170> around<00:03:29.290> making

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
this is the portal shaking around making

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.300 
this is the portal shaking around making
everything<00:03:30.280> shake<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:32.170> seems<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.160> it's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
everything shake it it seems like it's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.710 
everything shake it it seems like it's
an<00:03:33.430> earthquake<00:03:33.579> that's<00:03:34.120> why<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.359> government

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
an earthquake that's why the government

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.460 
an earthquake that's why the government
agents<00:03:35.200> got<00:03:35.380> strange<00:03:36.340> signals<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.239> if<00:03:38.140> you

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
agents got strange signals and if you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.280 
agents got strange signals and if you
see<00:03:38.769> this<00:03:38.950> report<00:03:39.459> card<00:03:39.730> there's<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.660> plus<00:03:41.019> a

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.610 
plus a plus in English math and science
but<00:03:44.500> phys<00:03:44.769> ed<00:03:44.980> there's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.370> d-minus<00:03:45.970> now<00:03:46.570> if<00:03:46.900> you

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
but phys ed there's a d-minus now if you

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.310 
but phys ed there's a d-minus now if you
think<00:03:48.310> about<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.640> does<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.329> report<00:03:50.049> card

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
think about it does this report card

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.009 
think about it does this report card
really<00:03:50.590> reflects<00:03:51.160> Stanford's<00:03:52.019> capabilities

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
really reflects Stanford's capabilities

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.770 
really reflects Stanford's capabilities
and<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:54.519> does<00:03:54.850> this<00:03:55.000> really<00:03:55.299> feel<00:03:55.750> like

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and that does this really feel like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.430 
and that does this really feel like
Stan's<00:03:56.440> report<00:03:56.920> card<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.959> one<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:58.989> my<00:03:59.170> theories

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
Stan's report card I one of my theories

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.530 
Stan's report card I one of my theories
is<00:03:59.769> that<00:03:59.799> this<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.459> actually<00:04:00.700> Stanley's

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
is that this is actually Stanley's

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.819 
is that this is actually Stanley's
report<00:04:02.049> card<00:04:02.290> stands<00:04:02.920> twin<00:04:03.750> because<00:04:04.750> all<00:04:05.079> the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
report card stands twin because all the

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.800 
report card stands twin because all the
evidence<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.519> we've<00:04:06.640> gathered<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.510> past

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
evidence that we've gathered in the past

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.710 
evidence that we've gathered in the past
is<00:04:08.140> that<00:04:08.829> Stanley<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.730> actually<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.239> smarter

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
is that Stanley is actually the smarter

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.240 
is that Stanley is actually the smarter
twin<00:04:10.900> he<00:04:11.859> he<00:04:12.370> was<00:04:12.519> even<00:04:12.760> reading<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.420> book

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
twin he he was even reading a book

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.680 
twin he he was even reading a book
during<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.640> wrestling<00:04:16.150> match<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
during the wrestling match in the

dreamscape or his flashback and during
that<00:04:19.959> flashback<00:04:20.320> grunkle<00:04:21.070> Stan<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.729> one

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
that flashback grunkle Stan was the one

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.500 
that flashback grunkle Stan was the one
fighting<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.979> him<00:04:23.979> grunkle<00:04:24.940> Stan<00:04:25.180> being<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
fighting so him grunkle Stan being the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.540 
fighting so him grunkle Stan being the
one<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.960> d-minus<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.889> physical

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
one to get a d-minus in physical

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.149 
one to get a d-minus in physical
education<00:04:27.610> would<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.539> be<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.740> wouldn't<00:04:30.070> make

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
education would just be it wouldn't make

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.230 
education would just be it wouldn't make
much<00:04:30.220> sense<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:31.000> we<00:04:31.390> know<00:04:31.510> Stanley

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
much sense and we know Stanley

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.360 
much sense and we know Stanley
is<00:04:32.330> really<00:04:32.599> smart<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.259> maybe<00:04:33.800> he's<00:04:33.979> not<00:04:34.130> good

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
is really smart so maybe he's not good

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.939 
is really smart so maybe he's not good
athletic<00:04:34.789> wise<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:36.199> is<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.620> really

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
athletic wise and this is just really

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.240 
athletic wise and this is just really
surprising<00:04:37.759> why<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.599> Stanley's<00:04:39.319> report<00:04:40.039> card

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
surprising why is Stanley's report card

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.870 
surprising why is Stanley's report card
there<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.490> don't<00:04:40.699> know<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:42.169> I<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:43.099> know<00:04:43.580> it's

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
there I don't know but I just know it's

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.029 
there I don't know but I just know it's
really<00:04:44.479> interesting<00:04:44.960> how<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.889> all

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
really interesting how this is all

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.430 
really interesting how this is all
coming<00:04:46.250> together<00:04:47.080> comment<00:04:48.080> below<00:04:48.169> your

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
coming together comment below your

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.920 
coming together comment below your
theories<00:04:48.860> on<00:04:48.889> this<00:04:49.190> stuff<00:04:49.449> because<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.479> just

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
theories on this stuff because I just

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.300 
theories on this stuff because I just
want<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.259> hear<00:04:51.349> what<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:51.500> guys<00:04:51.680> have<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:52.099> say

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
want to hear what you guys have to say

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.659 
want to hear what you guys have to say
and<00:04:52.520> if<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.599> see<00:04:53.930> at<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.259> very<00:04:54.560> edge<00:04:54.949> right

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
and if you see at the very edge right

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.790 
and if you see at the very edge right
next<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.120> report<00:04:56.449> card<00:04:56.660> there's<00:04:56.870> an<00:04:56.960> e<00:04:57.259> ly

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
next to the report card there's an e ly

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.680 
next to the report card there's an e ly
you<00:04:57.860> can<00:04:58.250> probably<00:04:58.580> only<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.030> ly<00:04:59.389> from

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
you can probably only see the ly from

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.320 
you can probably only see the ly from
here<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.440> it<00:05:00.560> says<00:05:00.740> ILY<00:05:01.310> now<00:05:02.030> you<00:05:02.090> may<00:05:02.300> think

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
here but it says ILY now you may think

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.300 
here but it says ILY now you may think
this<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.810> saying<00:05:03.020> Stanley<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.919> really

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
this is saying Stanley but I really

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.800 
this is saying Stanley but I really
don't<00:05:04.490> think<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:04.759> because<00:05:04.909> that's<00:05:05.419> not<00:05:05.630> how

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
don't think so because that's not how

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.350 
don't think so because that's not how
you<00:05:05.870> spell<00:05:06.020> Stanley<00:05:06.650> as<00:05:06.830> we<00:05:06.889> have<00:05:07.849> theorized

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
you spell Stanley as we have theorized

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.930 
you spell Stanley as we have theorized
so<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.319> probably<00:05:09.590> says<00:05:09.770> likely<00:05:10.370> or<00:05:10.610> not

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
so that probably says likely or not

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.230 
so that probably says likely or not
likely<00:05:11.389> or<00:05:11.569> something<00:05:12.050> like<00:05:12.169> that<00:05:13.030> alright<00:05:14.030> so

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
likely or something like that alright so

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.899 
likely or something like that alright so
in<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:14.509> part<00:05:14.870> at<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.080> end<00:05:15.229> of<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.590> teaser
