00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.469 
you know whatever is gonna go with you
on<00:01:38.650> your<00:01:38.710> date<00:01:38.890> strip<00:01:39.220> yep<00:01:39.520> yeah<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.030> maybe

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
on your date strip yep yeah and maybe

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.749 
on your date strip yep yeah and maybe
something<00:01:40.900> like<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.170> TA<00:01:41.439> crank<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.130> has<00:01:42.280> you

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
something like the TA crank that has you

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.340 
something like the TA crank that has you
know<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:43.030> real<00:01:43.180> elegance<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.840> but<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.200> can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
know a real elegance to it but it can

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.080 
know a real elegance to it but it can
take<00:01:44.470> probably<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.979> greatest<00:01:45.189> variety<00:01:45.820> of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
take probably the greatest variety of

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.520 
take probably the greatest variety of
chain<00:01:46.329> rings<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:46.720> can<00:01:46.899> imagine<00:01:47.049> sure

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
chain rings that you can imagine sure

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.219 
chain rings that you can imagine sure
and<00:01:48.369> there<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.850> think<00:01:49.390> that's<00:01:49.659> kind<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:49.930> what

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
and there I think that's kind of what

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.020 
and there I think that's kind of what
I'm<00:01:50.320> what<00:01:50.619> I'm<00:01:50.710> doing<00:01:51.070> yep<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.579> know<00:01:51.670> in<00:01:51.909> terms

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
I'm what I'm doing yep you know in terms

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.539 
I'm what I'm doing yep you know in terms
of<00:01:52.240> combining<00:01:52.390> old<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.930> new<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:54.280> fenders

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
of combining old and new these fenders

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.160 
of combining old and new these fenders
are<00:01:54.759> these<00:01:54.909> your<00:01:55.060> fenders<00:01:55.360> yeah<00:01:55.810> those<00:01:55.990> are<00:01:56.140> a

you know fit all kind of lends to the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.780 
you know fit all kind of lends to the
overall<00:04:07.680> goal<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.040> bike<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.490> it<00:04:08.580> worked

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
overall goal of the bike and it worked

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.100 
overall goal of the bike and it worked
and<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:08.970> think<00:04:09.000> it'll<00:04:09.270> work<00:04:09.330> well<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> build

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and I think it'll work well on the build

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.010 
and I think it'll work well on the build
and<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:11.040> mind<00:04:11.220> building<00:04:11.459> around<00:04:11.610> him<00:04:11.819> yep

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020
