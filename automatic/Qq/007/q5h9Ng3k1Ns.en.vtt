00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.050
 hi guys this video was shot specially 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.040
 for the channel outbid secrets 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 for the contest in general so i have under 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.870
 The hood has two main 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.250
 things about which I am now 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.059
 immediately literally show you and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.940
 tell all everything show in general what about 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.030
 than those who wish to believe it just 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.659
 can believe it who does not believe in 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.289
 that skeptics may just smile 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:03.109
 let's go now all show so look 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.789
 here and that is the meter flow from my audi 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:10.750
 a4 engine 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:15.310
 we see it on gas it's meter consumption 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.020
 take a second I already unscrewed it 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 take out the flow meter as we see it does not 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.000
 sieve 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:35.259
 considering you are Niels, this is the pipe 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.259
 delicious and here we see 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.960
 the very thing I told you about 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.640
 I have it attached if you 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.640
 see here she is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.510
 air flow regulator I do n't give it to you 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.480
 you just because he has me 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.600
 glued there it is such an iron thing 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:07.429
 its essence is to blow on the sensor 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 she blowing air flow whirls and 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.410
 unevenly hits the sensor when 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 sensor sees too much flow 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.900
 air he zombies over blends mix 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 gives 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.530
 less injection time ie he 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 reduces the injection time the second pieces it 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.110
 fuel hose magnets 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:40.470
 Here I have on on the rifle myself this 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:44.820
 thing that is their essence to polemize 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.720
 molecules how do you explain in general I'm 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:54.450
 holes have one charge electrons of another and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.600
 here is a set of magnets here is also a set 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.540
 magnets and they were like stretching 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.390
 i tear pull one way the molecules in 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 another in this regard are obtained 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.180
 microscopic literally on 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 molecular level space for 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.630
 air and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.230
 fuel becomes more when taken 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:24.700
 walls for fuel yes yes more better 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:32.470
 mixed with air because I them 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.740
 use let's go explain what's what 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.420
 general now I will explain to you what 's what 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.980
 these things that you showed under 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.230
 hood activators 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:50.770
 burning and adjuster of the air flow or 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.290
 in other words the adjuster regulator 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.650
 airflow and activator i 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:02.200
 use together why is this to the point for 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.970
 achievements more let's say more 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.650
 effectively for me, in general, the bottom do not judge 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.570
 strictly again skeptics smile 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.390
 don't believe it because skeptics him 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.299
 that you can't prove with any calculations 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.489
 not what numbers literally numbers i have 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.900
 No, I can not show them to you because 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.090
 my mine 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.310
 my car without a computer board 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.700
 I don't have it, I can't 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.020
 prove at best so here even 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.950
 I wish I could not show you 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.930
 numbers and numbers after fuel economy 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.500
 up is definitely present because 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.610
 any car from the factory to then he 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.410
 coming off the factory all 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.009
 adjustment literally adjustment 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.219
 engine 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.439
 the injection adjustments are relative 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:57.110
 they are on average 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.210
 Means there is some stock yes agree with 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.300
 it has a margin of five percent can 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.999
 be there three percent and when the sensor 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.919
 sees too much air flow 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:10.669
 more uneven sensor like 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:14.300
 strays and reduces injection time yes 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.389
 really so i tried 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.770
 my personal feelings machine is quieter 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:24.219
 the engine is a little quieter 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.409
 exhaust scent does not know maybe even 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:33.889
 again i don't have no hardware to 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:36.289
 measure it and what else is the machine 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:40.490
 goes quieter speak any 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:43.159
 I believed it and I bought it tried 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.949
 i no it's not an advertisement i don't advise anyone 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.580
 buy anything again inquiring minds 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:54.469
 have already paused and will choose slaughtered in 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.080
 search engine these words are the regulator in the flow 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:01.069
 air or air flow regulator 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.789
 and active ie activator and burning 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.769
 fuel and already literally on the site 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:11.149
 manufacturer and distributor and they already 

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:13.789
 read the information you need only 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:17.209
 believe for further updates 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.789
 stay on my channel this video also 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:22.699
 lay out on my channel it will be mine 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.529
 first video and what 's another very important 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:29.059
 thing 2011 I experimented with 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.639
 hydrogen fuel more precisely with gas 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:35.499
 Brown, I will briefly explain this gas 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:38.120
 which we get in the decay of water 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.830
 more precisely when the water breaks down into hydrogen 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.919
 and oxygen is this mixture is called 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.529
 Brown gas I can even something else 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:50.300
 show me under the hood, and that is, 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:53.029
 thing under my hood is leftovers 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.500
 this device there literally 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:59.960
 fuel heaters gas heater and 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.000
 and the intake manifold tube is all that 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.390
 left after my first experiences it 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.700
 there was something I had left photo i 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.700
 I will do this photo report seconds 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.040
 experiences were unsuccessful before the car 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.950
 worked 100% savings not 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.020
 reached and I just threw it all 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.680
 just a few more minutes 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.680
 attention 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:34.780
 here's a second fuel heater here 

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:40.930
 the fuel heater ships entered the gas 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:44.349
 Brown's court was entering Brown's gas plans were on 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.509
 on the coil it goes to the gearbox and here 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:50.409
 this thing and the words intake manifold 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:53.860
 here literally plastered hole and I 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:55.870
 I say I did experience, and of all details 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:01.530
 will be on my channel more gideon 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.530
 chop 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.219
 so good luck everyone
