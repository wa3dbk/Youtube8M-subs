whatever we can find in this rain gear

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.260 
whatever we can find in this rain gear
so<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.260> transducers<00:00:53.270> few

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so we get to use two transducers few

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
so we get to use two transducers few
speakers<00:00:54.809> yeah<00:00:55.649> five<00:00:55.949> pieces<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.370> cardboard

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
speakers yeah five pieces of cardboard

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.870 
speakers yeah five pieces of cardboard
one<00:00:57.629> cardboard<00:00:58.410> box<00:01:03.199> paper<00:01:04.199> towel<00:01:04.500> tubes

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.300 

cardboard<00:01:08.880> speakers<00:01:09.390> huh<00:01:09.630> okay<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.070> looks

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cardboard speakers huh okay it looks

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.830 
cardboard speakers huh okay it looks
like<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> boys<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.780> way

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
like the boys are going out of their way

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
like the boys are going out of their way
to<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.130> sound<00:01:14.460> like

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to make something to actually sound like

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
to make something to actually sound like
garbage<00:01:15.350> everyday<00:01:16.350> devices<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:17.159> smaller

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
garbage everyday devices get smaller

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
garbage everyday devices get smaller
lighter<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> less<00:01:18.659> expensive<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.470> build<00:01:19.619> all

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
lighter and less expensive to build all

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210 
lighter and less expensive to build all
of<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.729> makes<00:01:21.060> audio<00:01:21.509> quality<00:01:21.869> suffer<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of which makes audio quality suffer so

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
of which makes audio quality suffer so
how<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.520> these<00:01:23.640> guys<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.210> cardboard<00:01:24.840> safe

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
how will these guys make cardboard safe

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.870 
how will these guys make cardboard safe
then<00:01:25.619> obviously<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.280> gonna<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.580> digital

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
then obviously we're gonna use digital

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
then obviously we're gonna use digital
power<00:01:27.030> station<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.409> we'll

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
power station with to them up and we'll

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.990 
power station with to them up and we'll
make<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:28.920> sound<00:01:29.130> awesome

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.990 

yeah<00:01:36.350> no<00:01:37.350> tuning<00:01:38.070> tyria<00:01:38.340> done<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
yeah no tuning tyria done so you have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.050 
yeah no tuning tyria done so you have
you<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.409> pure

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
you have to you have to go on pure

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.620 
you have to you have to go on pure
acoustical<00:01:42.060> theory<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:44.299> area<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
acoustical theory here area of the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.680 
acoustical theory here area of the
cardboard<00:01:45.930> speaker<00:01:46.350> exactly

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.530 

I'm<00:01:51.690> going<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.200> harness<00:01:53.390> zero-point<00:01:54.390> energy

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I'm going to harness zero-point energy

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.930 
I'm going to harness zero-point energy
he's<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.770> harness<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> power<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
he's gonna harness the power of the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
he's gonna harness the power of the
pyramid<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.900> right<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.380> zero<00:01:58.680> zero

awesome<00:04:14.340> considering<00:04:14.820> with<00:04:14.940> what<00:04:15.150> we<00:04:15.270> started

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
awesome considering with what we started

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.670 
awesome considering with what we started
with<00:04:15.930> which<00:04:16.560> was<00:04:16.590> junk<00:04:18.350> cardboard<00:04:19.350> which<00:04:19.590> is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
with which was junk cardboard which is

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.160 
with which was junk cardboard which is
pretty<00:04:19.890> bad<00:04:20.100> using<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.150> DPS<00:04:21.540> technology

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
pretty bad using the the DPS technology

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.570 
pretty bad using the the DPS technology
I<00:04:22.200> was<00:04:22.350> able<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.680> find<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:23.130> resonant

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I was able to find the resonant

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.640 
I was able to find the resonant
frequency<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.120> cardboard<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.930> was<00:04:25.350> able<00:04:25.470> to

frequency of the cardboard I was able to

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.400 
frequency of the cardboard I was able to
find<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.610> know<00:04:26.670> what<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.450> flaws<00:04:27.720> were<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.230> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
find you know what the flaws were in the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.410 
find you know what the flaws were in the
speakers<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.550> after<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:36.120> know<00:04:36.150> a

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
speakers and you know after you know a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.270 
speakers and you know after you know a
few<00:04:36.690> hours<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:37.140> tuning<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.950> were<00:04:38.040> able<00:04:38.250> to

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
few hours of tuning you were able to

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.830 
few hours of tuning you were able to
erase<00:04:38.580> all<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:38.970> stuff<00:04:39.210> using<00:04:39.390> GPS

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
erase all that stuff using GPS

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.240 
erase all that stuff using GPS
technology<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.500> make<00:04:40.620> them<00:04:40.740> actually<00:04:40.920> sound

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
technology and make them actually sound

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.400 
technology and make them actually sound
like<00:04:41.310> speakers<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.180> think<00:04:42.690> good<00:04:45.020> yeah<00:04:46.020> but

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
like speakers and I think good yeah but

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.110 
like speakers and I think good yeah but
you<00:04:46.800> know<00:04:46.920> what<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.280> think<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.790> chimney

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
you know what I think that the chimney

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.910 
you know what I think that the chimney
had<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> lot<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.570> do<00:04:48.690> with<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.960> yeah<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.710> like

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
had a lot to do with it yeah and I like

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
my kitty cat feet yeah but I guess what

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.910

we<00:04:53.730> can't<00:04:53.970> agree<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.930> DPS<00:04:55.380> really

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
we can't agree on is that the DPS really

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.440 
we can't agree on is that the DPS really
is<00:04:56.010> what<00:04:56.220> made<00:04:56.490> those<00:04:56.670> things<00:04:56.940> sound<00:04:57.210> like
