00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.790
 in 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.820
 jo people turn your race because at another 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 new wrote to live rather all on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 number 3 in this series 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 should i try a live mole of languages ​​in it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.509
 free especially it is very difficult to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.789
 to get because of course it goes 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.009
 up to 30 and then in the previous episode 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 you saw what you get after that all the time 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.820
 the 30 goes so today we are in the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 clothing have come I understand this with 4 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
 kills behind and the e-series puzzle must 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 they pick him up in free from a i may 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.620
 do not stay in a certain place on the mat 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.120
 dominate so I just have to go around 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.829
 just run back and forth 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.110
 run and not remain in one place 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 and with that try to pick up the mole 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.650
 sometimes mp7 science and rapid speed like 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.510
 first person and I my sound one 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.920
 a bit harder because I have just arrived 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 away from blackops 2 and place or always 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 always pieces of hardam bollendorf 3 so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 if i can this guy chilly that here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.880
 runs more than I put here some noise 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 heard it naturally handy 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.050
 can you hear footsteps it is just mine 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 sound so also that better 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.649
 yorks also least likely there through all 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 on both sides you will come to the right 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.170
 then it comes around 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.790
 four other side nice and busy one who 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 okay here put my gates for reason 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 that sand destroyed me 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 indicate where to the enemy 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 because then you immediately see put 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.520
 this one tree nights both times that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.420
 point to cold makes every one of my 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 you throat again 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 so that root reason she is a super 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 Useful in foil especially only as one 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.320
 destroying a man you have nothing left 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 ambiente misti closed 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.930
 DJ works he no longer has to worry 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 that we just get the specialist bonus 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.830
 the game is leaking a little 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 kind of like a disadvantage but like us 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.740
 which have special bonus inside than 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 should it be ok now get him semtex 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.860
 in front so I have to see that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.570
 dodge and run far away to walk 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 so here nmi are very bad 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.080
 silly idea where he lied but if you do 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.450
 above with the type 25 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 mate come here please boy he 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.210
 shot someone and if he needs you 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.119
 destructor shoot you so someone else 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 when spider mite is now you need some coverage 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.240
 go looking but if that further neighbor 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.930
 Shoot also three so even one day 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 once over and I can not kill 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.640
 cunt so I have more time for your 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.069
 specialist bolivar 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.650
 this should succeed yes 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.049
 photos and texts of no he is coming 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.459
 is coming the is coming 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.230
 he will have the body plus your way I 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.969
 run away from a hare of hercules 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.019
 is anyway you can not kill him so 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.040
 what i do i just run ridiculous 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.049
 going that makes it difficult 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.189
 I do not feel risked opportunities 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.599
 that I will die so I just run 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.459
 away with him he will not find out 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.260
 masters good sign let him and leave 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.069
 earth where I just bring it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.030
 side of the folder 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.290
 but of course not too long in one place 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.519
 stops they get all the way again 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.719
 to the other side of the folder 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.799
 there is every corner that comes check you know 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.549
 but never if there is anyone somewhere that 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.989
 kempen 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.310
 you walk anyway once i am you 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.139
 no longer where it runs but and you walk 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.159
 somewhere 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.019
 he walks he again I hear him walking 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.599
 but of course that will stop you hear 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.549
 so also sit when you talk 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.989
 can camper pick up okay that happy 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.790
 dead but now what he did that guy 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.900
 but sometimes struggling 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.909
 case I know he did what 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.889
 he stood the Kempen so yes doesn't matter 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.560

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.129

 You don't mean that, man, he's there 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.050
 but can sit 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.050

 impossible to get it now we go 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.180
 just try that comeback completely 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.800
 to make what naturally came in the game 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.630
 while he was alone one already stood 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.860
 she could leave behind a horse so we 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.140
 now go from trying that come with too 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.160
 then we'll just close 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.720
 unfortunately we did not make it 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.180

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.400
 things are happening and people are killing people 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.960
 continue to know but point always ruined 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.000

 my tip to the kempen strek born 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.780
 running around 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.160

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.640
 corner but he also killzone 2 email 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.990
 everything because he sits in that corner and he 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.240
 is no longer going to come from German corners 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.430
 until they 've had it in them one 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.440
 corner so there is now away to the now 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.940
 luckily so that kind of campus look 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.100
 sex movie with someone once in their 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.620
 corner but they just continue to game to 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.350
 game game to gaming game to game the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.610

 for example, once must for menu 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.729
 I put on a lot of clothes to relax 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.870
 let's see where the game is ok then I'll go 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.970
 again and this is there too 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.550
 in the corner but this guy who was 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.020
 gods and 100% silently just moan 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.180

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.310
 tactics grandate it around on the one 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.570
 side of the folder 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.040
