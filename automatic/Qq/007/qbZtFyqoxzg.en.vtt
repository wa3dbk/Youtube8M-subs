happens<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.620> be<00:00:50.770> satin<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:52.300> I'm<00:00:52.420> going<00:00:52.510> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
happens to be satin and so I'm going to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.600 
happens to be satin and so I'm going to
do<00:00:52.719> sample<00:00:53.230> colors<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.770> here<00:00:54.010> because<00:00:54.219> this<00:00:54.489> is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
do sample colors on here because this is

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.990 
do sample colors on here because this is
a<00:00:54.640> custom<00:00:55.120> mix<00:00:55.360> mix<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.680> I'll<00:00:57.370> test<00:00:57.640> this<00:00:57.820> in

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
a custom mix mix and I'll test this in

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.380 
a custom mix mix and I'll test this in
the<00:00:58.090> light<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.480> see<00:00:58.510> how<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:59.020> turns<00:00:59.260> out<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.210> our

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
the light to see how it turns out so our

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.189 
the light to see how it turns out so our
first<00:01:01.600> step<00:01:01.899> is<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.350> find<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.399> color<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
first step is I find the color that the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600 
first step is I find the color that the
parents<00:01:05.199> like<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.680> child<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.189> this<00:01:06.430> one

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
go to our master color chart here and I

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.750 
go to our master color chart here and I
look<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.190> similar<00:01:12.549> color<00:01:12.760> number<00:01:13.240> 17<00:01:13.930> and

look for the similar color number 17 and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.950 
look for the similar color number 17 and
this<00:01:15.760> number<00:01:16.060> says<00:01:16.680> number<00:01:17.680> one<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:19.299> line<00:01:19.630> B

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
this number says number one to line B

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.490 
this number says number one to line B
and<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.740> number<00:01:21.070> twelve<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.000> top<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:23.260> go

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
and the number twelve to the top so I go

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.840 
and the number twelve to the top so I go
to<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.770> master<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:26.850> sample

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
to this master this is a sample

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.730 
to this master this is a sample

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
combination of these two is going to

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.710 
combination of these two is going to
make<00:01:47.520> purple<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:49.090> course<00:01:49.329> will<00:01:49.509> lighten

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
make purple and of course will lighten

make purple and of course will lighten
the<00:01:49.990> shade<00:01:50.229> depending<00:01:50.740> on<00:01:50.860> how<00:01:51.040> much<00:01:51.189> we<00:01:51.400> need

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the shade depending on how much we need

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.819

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
some of these little straps so I just

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.390 
some of these little straps so I just

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
pull in a little q-tip and this is our

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.759 
pull in a little q-tip and this is our
mix<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.849> here<00:02:34.879> as<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:36.109> remember<00:02:36.409> we<00:02:36.560> use

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
mix right here as you remember we use

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.369 
mix right here as you remember we use
number<00:02:37.189> 12<00:02:37.609> and<00:02:38.000> number<00:02:38.209> one<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.959> use<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
number 12 and number one I use it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.319 
number 12 and number one I use it
exactly<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:40.099> they<00:02:40.280> said<00:02:40.519> sometimes<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> have

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
exactly as they said sometimes you have

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.869 
exactly as they said sometimes you have
to<00:02:41.599> improvise<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.530> mix<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> colors<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> little

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
to improvise and mix the colors a little

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.550 
to improvise and mix the colors a little
differently<00:02:44.359> but<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.989> seems<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
differently but this one seems to be a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.440 
differently but this one seems to be a
great<00:02:45.859> shade<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.379> dark<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.239> glass

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
great shade it's a dark out of the glass

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.930 
great shade it's a dark out of the glass
but<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.989> won't<00:02:51.200> be<00:02:51.889> like<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.099> as<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.549> apply<00:02:52.819> it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
but it won't be like that as I apply it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.610 
but it won't be like that as I apply it
