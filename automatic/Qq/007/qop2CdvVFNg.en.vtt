00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
levels of choppiness there if we go

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
levels of choppiness there if we go
through<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> gallery<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.950> could

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
through the gallery here see if we could

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
through the gallery here see if we could
take<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> gallery<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.659> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
take a look at the gallery see if we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
take a look at the gallery see if we
could<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.110> pinch<00:01:40.380> gestures<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.130> how

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
could do some pinch gestures and see how

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
could do some pinch gestures and see how
that<00:01:41.280> handles<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.939> not<00:01:44.939> surprising<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that handles it so not surprising it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
that handles it so not surprising it
runs<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:47.009> smoothly<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:49.610> pretty<00:01:50.610> decent

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
runs pretty smoothly here pretty decent

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.840 
runs pretty smoothly here pretty decent
not<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> bad<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.610> acceptable<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
not that bad at all so acceptable for

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
not that bad at all so acceptable for
now<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.119> we'll<00:01:54.299> test<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.750> even<00:01:55.380> further

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
now but we'll test it out even further

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.219 
now but we'll test it out even further
later<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.670> let's<00:01:56.820> jump<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
later on so let's jump right to the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
later on so let's jump right to the
first<00:01:58.590> benchmark<00:01:58.979> test

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
first benchmark test

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.929 
first benchmark test
let's<00:02:00.090> run<00:02:00.270> quadrant<00:02:01.369> we're<00:02:02.369> ready<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.820> in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
let's run quadrant we're ready right in

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
let's run quadrant we're ready right in
a<00:02:02.969> couple<00:02:03.119> times<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> look<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:04.920> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
a couple times and if you look at this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.069 
a couple times and if you look at this
guy<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:06.299> managed<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.750> roughly

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
guy here we managed to get roughly

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.800 
guy here we managed to get roughly
around<00:02:07.310> 1800<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.660> for

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
around 1800 which is you know just for

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
around 1800 which is you know just for
benchmark<00:02:10.289> test<00:02:10.500> pretty<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:11.129> bad

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
benchmark test pretty pretty bad

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.430 
benchmark test pretty pretty bad
nowadays<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.870> devices<00:02:13.200> out

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
nowadays you have other devices out

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.890 
nowadays you have other devices out
there<00:02:13.650> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
there that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.410 
there that
easily<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.260> into<00:02:14.400> 3000<00:02:15.400> mark<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.239> let's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
easily get into 3000 mark so let's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.179 
easily get into 3000 mark so let's
quickly<00:02:16.599> run<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.049> one<00:02:17.349> more<00:02:17.560> time<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.950> see<00:02:18.129> if

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
quickly run this one more time to see if

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.000 
quickly run this one more time to see if
we<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:18.879> get<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.150> consistent<00:02:19.390> score<00:02:20.230> now<00:02:20.950> you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
we can we get a consistent score now you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.490 
we can we get a consistent score now you
tell<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.370> jumps<00:02:21.879> from<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.930> landscape

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
tell it jumps from a you know landscape

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
tell it jumps from a you know landscape
to<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> portrait<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.299> it's<00:02:25.510> full<00:02:25.689> screen<00:02:25.930> too

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
to a portrait and it's full screen too

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.630 
to a portrait and it's full screen too
you<00:02:26.349> could<00:02:26.500> set<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.829> to<00:02:26.860> whatever<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.400> want

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you could set it to whatever you want

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.479 
you could set it to whatever you want
there's<00:02:28.420> different<00:02:28.780> options<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.439> right<00:02:30.370> now

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
there's different options but right now

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.099 
there's different options but right now
we'll<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:30.670> let<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.030> do<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.209> has<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.870> here

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
we'll just let it do what has to do here

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.479 
we'll just let it do what has to do here
so<00:02:32.140> let's<00:02:32.530> let's<00:02:32.829> just<00:02:32.890> wait<00:02:33.159> for<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.430> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
so let's let's just wait for this to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.479 
so let's let's just wait for this to
load<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.150> see<00:02:34.569> what<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.840> gets<00:02:34.959> us<00:02:38.430> now<00:02:39.430> for

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
load up and see what it gets us now for

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.860 
load up and see what it gets us now for
a<00:02:39.640> gaming<00:02:40.000> device<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.420> gonna<00:02:40.629> be<00:02:40.689> something

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
a gaming device is gonna be something

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.479 
a gaming device is gonna be something
you<00:02:41.109> might<00:02:41.140> want<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.530> look<00:02:41.680> at<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:41.920> because

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
you might want to look at just because

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.390 
you might want to look at just because
like<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.359> Sony<00:02:43.569> Tablet<00:02:43.840> S<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.500> also<00:02:45.189> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
like the Sony Tablet S and also the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.970 
like the Sony Tablet S and also the
Xperia<00:02:46.000> Play<00:02:46.150> 40<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.049> playstation

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
Xperia Play 40 it is playstation

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
Xperia Play 40 it is playstation
certified<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.780> kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.959> makes<00:02:50.109> use<00:02:50.319> of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
certified and it kind of makes use of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.930 
certified and it kind of makes use of
the<00:02:50.530> two<00:02:50.709> touch<00:02:51.040> screen<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:51.760> two

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
the two touch screen and the two

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.509 
the two touch screen and the two
displays<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:53.019> there<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.409> top<00:02:53.620> being<00:02:53.889> where

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
displays on there the top being where

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.520 
displays on there the top being where
you<00:02:54.670> would<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:54.940> most<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.450> action<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you would see most of the action and the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.080 
you would see most of the action and the
bottom<00:02:56.889> is<00:02:56.920> normally<00:02:57.459> where<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.760> see<00:02:57.970> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
bottom is normally where you see the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.149 
bottom is normally where you see the
virtual<00:02:58.480> control<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.319> have<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.889> but

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
virtual control so you have that but

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.770 
virtual control so you have that but
it's<00:03:00.549> kind<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.730> awkward<00:03:00.909> we're<00:03:01.359> testing<00:03:01.689> it

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's kind of awkward we're testing it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.479 
it's kind of awkward we're testing it
out<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.079> because<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.500> one-inch<00:03:02.950> bezels

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
out just because of the one-inch bezels

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.490 
out just because of the one-inch bezels
on<00:03:03.639> both<00:03:03.879> sides<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.780> know<00:03:04.900> made<00:03:05.139> of<00:03:05.260> very

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
on both sides you know made of very

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.800 
on both sides you know made of very
hearts<00:03:05.769> actually<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> controls

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
hearts actually you get to the controls

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.640 
hearts actually you get to the controls
just<00:03:07.930> because<00:03:08.260> they're<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.409> little<00:03:08.470> bit

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
just because they're a little bit

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.770 
just because they're a little bit
further<00:03:09.010> away<00:03:09.189> as<00:03:09.639> your<00:03:10.209> group<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.689> know

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
further away as your group you know

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.280 
further away as your group you know

holding on to the italic the other thing

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.379 
holding on to the italic the other thing
is<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.920> probably<00:03:15.189> makes<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.639> you<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.359> a

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
is it probably makes for you know a

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.330 
is it probably makes for you know a
great<00:03:16.659> reading<00:03:17.019> device<00:03:17.439> just<00:03:17.739> because<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.160> its

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
great reading device just because of its

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.159 
great reading device just because of its
foldable<00:03:19.120> design<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.810> something<00:03:20.109> you

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
foldable design not something you

is just an 2:2 we have ran already so
we'll<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.229> show<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.409> the<00:04:26.529> results<00:04:26.950> that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
we'll just show you the results that

let's<00:04:29.260> go<00:04:29.530> back<00:04:29.770> here<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.750> see<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:31.810> we<00:04:31.930> get<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
let's go back here so see if we get the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.250 
let's go back here so see if we get the
scenario<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.210> looks<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.720> far<00:04:34.750> as<00:04:34.990> this

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260

sure<00:05:00.970> we'll<00:05:01.060> show<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.300> two<00:05:01.990> more<00:05:02.140> tests<00:05:02.560> yeah

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
sure we'll show you two more tests yeah

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.200 
sure we'll show you two more tests yeah
we'll<00:05:02.920> do<00:05:03.040> lint<00:05:03.280> pack<00:05:03.520> because<00:05:03.730> that's<00:05:03.910> pretty

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
we'll do lint pack because that's pretty

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.290 
we'll do lint pack because that's pretty
quick<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.830> let's<00:05:05.830> run<00:05:06.250> lint<00:05:06.550> pack<00:05:06.790> here<00:05:07.060> for

quick so let's run lint pack here for

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.330 
quick so let's run lint pack here for
Android<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:07.990> we'll<00:05:08.290> run<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> multi<00:05:09.010> thread

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.530 
Android and we'll run a multi thread
here<00:05:09.990> see<00:05:10.990> what<00:05:11.170> we<00:05:11.290> get<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:14.280> 50<00:05:15.280> million<00:05:15.790> flops

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
here see what we get so 50 million flops

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.370 
here see what we get so 50 million flops
and<00:05:17.430> take<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.760> three<00:05:19.150> point<00:05:19.390> three<00:05:20.230> point

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
and take it to three point three point

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.920 
and take it to three point three point
one<00:05:20.620> seven<00:05:20.950> seconds<00:05:21.670> I'm<00:05:21.850> not<00:05:22.000> bad<00:05:22.270> in<00:05:22.660> that

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
one seven seconds I'm not bad in that

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.180 
one seven seconds I'm not bad in that
area<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.470> run<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.280> one<00:05:24.460> more<00:05:24.580> time<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:26.190> there

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
area just run it one more time so there

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.470 
area just run it one more time so there
you<00:05:27.250> go<00:05:27.340> pretty<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.640> pretty<00:05:27.880> much<00:05:28.090> percent

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
you go pretty a pretty much percent

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.690 
you go pretty a pretty much percent
consistent<00:05:29.020> there<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.950> last<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.460> it's<00:05:30.580> gonna

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
consistent there and last one it's gonna

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.830 
consistent there and last one it's gonna
be<00:05:30.820> just<00:05:31.240> neo<00:05:31.810> core<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.700> normally<00:05:33.700> we'd<00:05:33.940> see

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
be just neo core and normally we'd see

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.740 
be just neo core and normally we'd see
roughly<00:05:35.350> a<00:05:35.440> score<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.800> you<00:05:36.400> know<00:05:36.520> 58<00:05:36.970> 60<00:05:37.450> frames

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
roughly a score of you know 58 60 frames

roughly a score of you know 58 60 frames
per<00:05:37.930> second<00:05:38.380> with<00:05:38.500> this<00:05:38.650> benchmark<00:05:39.460> test<00:05:39.730> hey

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
per second with this benchmark test hey

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.660 
per second with this benchmark test hey
I'll<00:05:40.060> see<00:05:40.120> how<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.360> handles<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:44.400> so<00:05:45.400> we'll<00:05:45.520> let

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
I'll see how it handles it so we'll let

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.360 
I'll see how it handles it so we'll let
it<00:05:45.820> play<00:05:46.060> see<00:05:46.780> if<00:05:46.840> we<00:05:46.960> get<00:05:47.140> no<00:05:47.470> good<00:05:47.950> only<00:05:48.160> do<00:05:48.280> it

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
it play see if we get no good only do it

00:05:48.370 --> 00:06:00.909 
it play see if we get no good only do it
one<00:05:48.610> screen<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:49.210> let's<00:05:49.600> wait<00:05:49.720> right<00:05:49.960> here

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919

as far as this the graphical components

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.619 
as far as this the graphical components
here<00:06:03.840> looks<00:06:04.080> nice<00:06:04.319> a<00:06:04.620> lot<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.490> shades<00:06:05.789> a<00:06:06.270> lot<00:06:06.539> of

here looks nice a lot of shades a lot of

down<00:06:13.349> with<00:06:13.500> its<00:06:13.680> operation<00:06:13.979> but<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.520> looks

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
down with its operation but it looks

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.550 
down with its operation but it looks
like<00:06:14.699> it's<00:06:14.909> maintaining<00:06:15.300> good<00:06:15.569> good<00:06:16.229> a<00:06:16.259> good

like it's maintaining good good a good
amount<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.830> fluidity<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:24.240> here<00:06:24.599> we<00:06:24.719> go<00:06:24.840> it

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
amount of fluidity so here we go it

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.159 
amount of fluidity so here we go it
should<00:06:25.050> be<00:06:25.349> wrapping<00:06:25.710> up<00:06:25.979> right<00:06:26.250> now<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:28.050> it

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
should be wrapping up right now and it

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.679 
should be wrapping up right now and it
