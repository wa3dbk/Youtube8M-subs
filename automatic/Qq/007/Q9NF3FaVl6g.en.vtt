 oval as a symbol for rest and relaxation 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.509
 in the bathroom was at the washbasins 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.179
 however, these are now retained 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.890
 lighter and contoured overall 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.420
 we have slightly reduced the higher one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.370
 but the vanity tops are still on 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.680
 nice deep and thus have a high 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 functionality 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 was 60 we can see here 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 Two wall-mounted vanities once 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.149
 70 and 1 x 50 cm both wall-bound 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.550
 Vanities now also with furniture 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.929
 combined 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 The washbasins are both with and 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.670
 also available without overflow 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 we have the fittings series laura specifically 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.109
 for the washbasin by avignon 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.839
 generation by an increased stand fitting 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 extended optional are valves with 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.650
 a ceramic cover available 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350
 this leads to everything being done 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.689
 a casting works 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 we have a completely new one 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.130
 furniture collection at avenue generation 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 Here is the highlight of the front this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.590
 is deformed in two sides and that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 once horizontally and once vertically 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 This one can also be nice if you 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.189
 nice to see the excerpts 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.409
 here we see how deformed the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.600
 front actually is herewith we have 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 the organic form of the table tries 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.420
 to record in order to create an overall picture 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.000
 to generate in the bathroom 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.430
 the interior layout was on with much 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.939
 love we designed here in one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.619
 two sockets that are always there 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.360
 Besides, we have for example a 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 So he has a fÃ¶hn both ways 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.829
 plugged in and get stuck 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.509
 can stow everything nice 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.149
 besides, we have one up here 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.590
 Nice speech and thus have the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 deformed friend used to more 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.369
 to create storage space 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.130
 also the sunken handles take the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.990
 form language again on the feet the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.900
 you can see here at the furniture 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.209

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.459
 Mirror also has an organic form 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.530
 Here is the highlight of the technique we 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.170
 can be a cold light in one 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.150
 change warm light everyone can himself 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 decide which Lichtenberg 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.170
 prefers the bathtub of a- b- and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.120
 also takes up the formal language again 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.010
 we currently have one in the assortment 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 tub with a ridge at this height 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.459
 the known one does not exist anymore 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.760
 we now have a tub of one 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.760
