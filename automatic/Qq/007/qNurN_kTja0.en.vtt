00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
how I'm like I probably have three which

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.170 
how I'm like I probably have three which
is<00:03:57.290> BS<00:03:57.650> or<00:03:58.070> I've<00:03:58.310> been<00:03:58.490> playing<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.820> game<00:03:59.000> the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
is BS or I've been playing the game the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.050 
is BS or I've been playing the game the
entire<00:03:59.300> time<00:03:59.810> and<00:03:59.840> only<00:04:00.110> got<00:04:00.350> three<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.060> don't

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
entire time and only got three I don't

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.390 
entire time and only got three I don't
stuff<00:04:02.390> it<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:03.020> gold<00:04:03.260> either<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.040> guess

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
stuff it with gold either so I guess

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.280 
stuff it with gold either so I guess
that<00:04:04.670> could<00:04:05.120> be<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.270> thing<00:04:05.570> like<00:04:05.810> if<00:04:05.960> I<00:04:06.080> just

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
that could be a thing like if I just

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.500 
that could be a thing like if I just
kept<00:04:06.560> stuff<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.010> stuff<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.310> stuff<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.670> maybe
