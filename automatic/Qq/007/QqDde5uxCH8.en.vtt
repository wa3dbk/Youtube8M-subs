00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
for the style I put my hair the evening

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.539 
for the style I put my hair the evening
before<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:13.139> putting<00:00:13.500> into<00:00:13.650> some<00:00:13.980> chunky

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
before by putting into some chunky

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730 
before by putting into some chunky
twists<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.480> morning<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.049> undid<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> twist

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
twists so that morning I undid the twist

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
twists so that morning I undid the twist
and<00:00:16.980> basically<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.850> stretch<00:00:18.090> them<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.449> just

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and basically just stretch them out just

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.490 
and basically just stretch them out just
to<00:00:18.990> give<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.410> less<00:00:19.680> defined<00:00:20.279> look<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to give it a less defined look so I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
to give it a less defined look so I
fluffed<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.850> basically<00:00:24.060> just

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
fluffed it out and I basically just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.689 
fluffed it out and I basically just
sectioned<00:00:24.869> part<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.920> hair<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> front

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
sectioned part of my hair in the front

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
sectioned part of my hair in the front
and<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.449> used<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.810> clip<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> secure<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and I used a clip to secure it so that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
and I used a clip to secure it so that
it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> used

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it was out of the way so then I used

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
it was out of the way so then I used
some<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.320> hair<00:00:34.530> butter<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.160> smooth<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
some of my hair butter to smooth the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.770 
some of my hair butter to smooth the
side<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> ham<00:00:36.980> put<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.300> secured

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

that<00:00:40.170> section<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.370> bobby<00:00:41.550> pins<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.299 

pushed<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> towards<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
pushed that towards the back as well and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
pushed that towards the back as well and
just<00:00:47.789> continue<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.539> fluff<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> out<00:00:48.989> a

just continue to just fluff it out a
little<00:00:49.289> bit<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.670> realized<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.149> actually

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
little bit and I realized I actually

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
little bit and I realized I actually
don't<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.750> enough<00:00:52.260> hair<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> front<00:00:52.980> at

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
least not as much as I wanted so I just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
least not as much as I wanted so I just
added<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.230> bit<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> hair<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:56.610> much<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
added a bit of hair how much is

completely<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.260> wanted<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
completely up to you but I wanted a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.639 
completely up to you but I wanted a
fuller<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.699> again<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.420> use<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> clip

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
fuller look so again I just use the clip

to<00:01:02.039> secure<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.850> away<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.970> then<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> repeated

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to secure that away and then I repeated

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
to secure that away and then I repeated
that<00:01:06.930> same<00:01:07.229> step<00:01:07.560> using<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:07.950> hair<00:01:08.130> button<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
