00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
windshield wiper a little diagnostic box

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
windshield wiper a little diagnostic box
and<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> bunch<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> pins<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.829> and

you can see that the in the lower the
the<00:00:40.680> diagnostic<00:00:41.489> box<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> divided<00:00:42.210> into<00:00:42.300> two

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the diagnostic box is divided into two

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.950 
the diagnostic box is divided into two
sections<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> top<00:00:43.410> section<00:00:44.840> second<00:00:45.840> one

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
sections in the top section second one

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
sections in the top section second one
in<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> far<00:00:46.620> left<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> only

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in from the far left and it's the only

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.139 
in from the far left and it's the only
one<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> pin<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
one with with a pin in there with a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
one with with a pin in there with a
metal<00:00:51.149> pin<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.809> area

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
metal pin in there in that area

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
metal pin in there in that area
so<00:00:52.770> anyways<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> second<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:54.000> sure<00:00:54.030> you

get the right one and this one you need
to<00:00:56.550> ground<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> anywhere<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> chassis<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to ground it anywhere on the chassis so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.389 
to ground it anywhere on the chassis so
what<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.289> done<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.620> run<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> wire<00:00:59.190> in

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
what I've done is just run a wire in

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.979 
what I've done is just run a wire in
there<00:01:00.050> put<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> piece<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> wire<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.989> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there put a piece of wire in there to to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.240 
there put a piece of wire in there to to
connect<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> box<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.070> ran<00:01:05.220> a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
there's a pause in between the two and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.860 
there's a pause in between the two and
you<00:02:13.569> read<00:02:13.720> those<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.050> put<00:02:14.200> them<00:02:14.350> together<00:02:14.440> and

look<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:56.680> 47<00:03:00.570> no<00:03:01.570> no<00:03:01.750> numerical<00:03:02.200> order<00:03:02.590> for

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
look up 47 no no numerical order for

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.560 
look up 47 no no numerical order for
some<00:03:03.160> dumb<00:03:03.430> reason<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.910> don't<00:03:04.090> know<00:03:04.180> either<00:03:04.329> and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
some dumb reason I don't know either and

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.720 
some dumb reason I don't know either and
then<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.989> okay<00:03:05.410> there's<00:03:05.590> 47<00:03:06.239> 40<00:03:07.239> 74<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:09.489> long

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
then not okay there's 47 40 74 for long

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.759 
then not okay there's 47 40 74 for long
or<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:11.310> slow<00:03:12.310> flashes<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.970> seven<00:03:13.360> quick<00:03:13.769> they

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
or for slow flashes and seven quick they

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.580 
or for slow flashes and seven quick they
go<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.040> there<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.400> ABS<00:03:16.329> wheel<00:03:16.750> speed<00:03:17.110> sensor

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
go in there and ABS wheel speed sensor

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.890 
go in there and ABS wheel speed sensor
output<00:03:18.070> missing<00:03:18.489> from<00:03:18.910> right<00:03:19.150> rear<00:03:19.360> ABS<00:03:19.720> so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
output missing from right rear ABS so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.210 
output missing from right rear ABS so
basically<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> right<00:03:20.470> rear<00:03:20.650> wheel<00:03:20.739> speed

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
basically the right rear wheel speed

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.940 
basically the right rear wheel speed
sensor<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:23.140> happens<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.650> went<00:03:23.859> to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
sensor and it just so happens I went to

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.259 
sensor and it just so happens I went to
the<00:03:24.070> wrecking<00:03:24.370> yard<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.730> other<00:03:24.760> day<00:03:25.060> and

right rear wheel off and check it out

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.010 
right rear wheel off and check it out
well<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> first<00:04:31.300> things<00:04:31.509> you<00:04:31.600> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> check

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
well the first things you want to check

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.900 
well the first things you want to check
if<00:04:32.139> it's<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.320> wheel<00:04:32.500> speed<00:04:32.770> sensor<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.430> Jack<00:04:33.759> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
brake off and turn the wheels by hand if

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.620 
brake off and turn the wheels by hand if
you've<00:04:39.490> got<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.669> sticking<00:04:40.060> parking<00:04:40.449> brake

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
you've got a sticking parking brake

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.839 
you've got a sticking parking brake
that'll<00:04:40.930> cause<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.440> wheel<00:04:41.860> speed<00:04:42.130> sensor<00:04:42.580> to

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
that'll cause the wheel speed sensor to

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.610 
that'll cause the wheel speed sensor to
lag<00:04:43.330> behind<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.840> other<00:04:43.960> ones<00:04:44.169> it's<00:04:44.410> going<00:04:44.560> to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
lag behind the other ones it's going to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.670 
lag behind the other ones it's going to
think<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.009> ABS<00:04:45.250> should<00:04:45.490> be<00:04:45.639> on<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.680> it's

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
think that the ABS should be on and it's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.529 
think that the ABS should be on and it's
gonna<00:04:47.889> triple<00:04:48.160> problem<00:04:48.550> same<00:04:49.150> with<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> front

spin by it counts those little teeth as

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.960 
spin by it counts those little teeth as
they<00:05:43.900> go<00:05:44.050> by<00:05:44.229> the<00:05:44.289> magnet<00:05:44.889> is<00:05:45.220> pulled<00:05:45.580> in<00:05:45.759> by

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
they go by the magnet is pulled in by

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.520 
they go by the magnet is pulled in by
each<00:05:46.150> tooth<00:05:46.419> as<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.750> goes<00:05:46.870> by<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.409> when

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
each tooth as it goes by and when

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.260 
each tooth as it goes by and when
there's<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.830> space<00:05:48.220> in<00:05:48.430> between<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:48.909> goes<00:05:49.030> back

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
there's a space in between it goes back

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.300 
there's a space in between it goes back
out<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:50.229> counts<00:05:50.349> the<00:05:50.590> revolutions<00:05:51.099> and

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
out and it counts the revolutions and

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.010 
out and it counts the revolutions and
that's<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.550> way<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:51.759> determines<00:05:52.539> whether<00:05:52.720> one

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
that's the way it determines whether one

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.360 
that's the way it determines whether one
wheel<00:05:53.229> is<00:05:53.440> spinning<00:05:53.740> faster<00:05:54.099> than<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.250> other

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
wheel is spinning faster than the other

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.430 
wheel is spinning faster than the other
if<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.210> have<00:05:55.240> different<00:05:55.509> sized<00:05:55.840> tires<00:05:56.110> than

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
if you have different sized tires than

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.589 
if you have different sized tires than
the<00:05:56.560> front<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.220> rear<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:58.180> could<00:05:58.419> cause

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
the front to the rear that could cause
