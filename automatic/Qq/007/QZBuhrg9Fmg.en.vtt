 Circuits Well, today we have a review 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.969
 such a mini column of times super voicing 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:14.480
 my super bass with built-in face with 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.120
 the receiver for under the channel which is not me 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.260
 phone tablet laptop 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.230
 now I need no reason let's 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.020
 consider the controls and myself 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.410
 the design of the plank column is made in 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.230
 so 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.930
 glossy color can even be said 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 great mirror can be clearly seen 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.160
 everything is seen here we have a speaker 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.030
 hidden speaker powerful music principle 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.660
 enough to listen now we connect 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.010
 themselves hear so on we go 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.160
 such a belt 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.649
 this is for smooth volume control 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.750
 pushing 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.860

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 deepens decreases increases 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.799

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.420
 inserted up to support up to 16 gigabytes 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:18.250
 microphone on 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.049
 charge indicator and condition here 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:29.299
 device or input aux it combined 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.540
 you can still plus connect through the connector 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:39.500
 headphones if it can be seen from below 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.229
 power button on and off so

 about three battery lasts 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.980
 three and a half hours watching what

 Fatma less if you listen more so 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.459
 the average will work longer charging 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.000
 like a regular phone 2 hours two s 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.030
 half of the computer will be longer 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.590
 charge from 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:29.530
 everywhere charging to local faster if 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:33.580
 scale but if you can charge super 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 powerful sound anya of course you don't have 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.500
 on the side it is good there is no distortion 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.979

 radio a little weak sp on radio but 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:57.270
 for more designed for bluetooth and for 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:58.830
 flash is the only flaw that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.800
 speakers she 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:07.050
