00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you're going to tap is because you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
you're going to tap is because you
really<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> deep<00:01:38.520> into<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.270> pore

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
really want to get it deep into the pore

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
really want to get it deep into the pore
so<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.130> even<00:01:41.729> tone

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so that you can make it one even tone

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
so that you can make it one even tone
because<00:01:42.899> remember<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.649> were<00:01:43.740> going

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because remember like if you were going

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.370 
because remember like if you were going
to<00:01:43.950> paint<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.520> canvas<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:46.200> make

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to paint a canvas you would first make

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
to paint a canvas you would first make
everything<00:01:46.740> white<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.090> color

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
everything white so it's all one color

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850 
everything white so it's all one color
and<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> colors<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.380> top<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.740> it

and then you put the colors on top of it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.249 
and then you put the colors on top of it
the<00:01:50.310> foundation<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:51.450> thing<00:01:51.840> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the foundation is the same thing so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620

that really pretty and it just gives you

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.290 
that really pretty and it just gives you
a<00:06:54.680> little<00:06:55.070> more<00:06:55.190> fullness<00:06:55.550> I<00:06:55.940> mean<00:06:56.150> you<00:06:56.240> don't

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
a little more fullness I mean you don't

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.460 
a little more fullness I mean you don't
have<00:06:56.480> to<00:06:56.570> do<00:06:56.660> this<00:06:56.780> every<00:06:57.020> day<00:06:57.050> but<00:06:57.350> certainly

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
have to do this every day but certainly

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.500 
have to do this every day but certainly
if<00:06:57.740> you're<00:06:57.860> going<00:06:58.130> out<00:06:58.280> at<00:06:58.430> night<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:59.330> can

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
if you're going out at night you can

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.040 
if you're going out at night you can
just<00:06:59.720> fill<00:06:59.930> in<00:07:00.169> like<00:07:01.100> that<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:01.760> you<00:07:02.690> have<00:07:02.870> to

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
just fill in like that and you have to

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.170 
just fill in like that and you have to
practice<00:07:03.260> doing<00:07:03.680> this<00:07:03.950> a<00:07:04.010> little<00:07:04.250> bit<00:07:04.460> but

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
practice doing this a little bit but

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.570 
practice doing this a little bit but
once<00:07:05.960> you<00:07:06.169> practice<00:07:06.410> it's<00:07:07.070> really<00:07:07.400> not<00:07:07.520> very

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
once you practice it's really not very

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.370 
once you practice it's really not very
hard<00:07:08.000> I<00:07:08.240> was<00:07:08.330> very<00:07:08.510> intimidated<00:07:08.810> to<00:07:09.169> do<00:07:09.260> this

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380
