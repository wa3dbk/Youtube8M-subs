that's<00:03:25.590> far<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.130> has<00:03:26.340> solar<00:03:27.090> damage<00:03:27.360> at<00:03:27.870> once

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
that's far it has solar damage at once

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.600 
that's far it has solar damage at once
again<00:03:28.200> will<00:03:28.530> plan<00:03:28.770> on<00:03:28.920> using<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.280> one<00:03:29.430> for

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
again will plan on using this one for

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.040 
again will plan on using this one for
the<00:03:29.700> next<00:03:29.850> round<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.209> testing<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.690> out<00:03:30.840> how

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
the next round and testing this out how

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.610 
the next round and testing this out how
it<00:03:31.260> goes<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.000> definitely<00:03:33.000> love<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
it goes and definitely love the the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.160 
it goes and definitely love the the
reason<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.950> love<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.340> one<00:03:35.550> is<00:03:35.700> because<00:03:36.170> when

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
reason I love this one is because when

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.050 
reason I love this one is because when
you<00:03:37.290> shoot<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.770> one<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.400> only<00:03:38.430> doesn't<00:03:38.850> let

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you shoot this one not only doesn't let

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.630

can<00:03:41.880> hold<00:03:42.090> three<00:03:42.300> shells<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.900> lets<00:03:43.020> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
can hold three shells so it lets you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.350 
can hold three shells so it lets you
carry<00:03:43.290> three<00:03:43.620> rockets<00:03:44.100> at<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.640> time<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.240> it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
carry three rockets at a time and it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.720 
carry three rockets at a time and it
also<00:03:45.600> lets<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.740> sub<00:03:47.220> type<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.550> like
