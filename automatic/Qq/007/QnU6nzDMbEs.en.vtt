00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 hello people and everyone interested in creating things in 3d 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.910
 I am thabit villena and I bring you a tutorial to install the 3d studio max 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.269
 9 on your pc 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.309
 but before I start I would like to clarify some things through three points 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.109
 point 1 on the 3d max that we are going to install 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.239
 1 This is a new version of the previous video with higher quality and more 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.060
 detailed in your instructions 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.270
 2 This version of the 3d studio max 9 is 32 bits and will run perfectly in 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.499
 Windows Xp 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.589
 some users report to me that it also runs in windows vista 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.580
 3 the trinary serial names that are provided here work only 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.810
 for this program since some users have not reported that 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.000
 they work in other previous versions including the downloadable demo of the site 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 official 4 verify that they do not have another version or demo of the 3d installed 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.360
 max in its thirteen since that prevents the installation or execution of this 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.210
 Program 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.540
 5 Make sure you have completely uninstalled any previous version or 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.090
 3d max demo since that also generates problems with the installation or 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.820
 execution of this program 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.810
 points 2 some indications for newbies on the pc and they are trying 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.690
 follow this installation 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.590
 1 to download this program you will need to download 6 files in raw format. 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.150
 which need a program called a while 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.220
 2 the six links to download the program are located in the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.000
 description of the video in your youtube window click on the text more 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.900
 information to see the full list of links 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.660
 3 once you have the six files and the winrar program 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.280
 there will be any of the six files and click on the button we will extract 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.200
 as seen in the image 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.230
 there they will choose the route where the program of decompression will be 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.230
 installation 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.560
 if you are wondering why because they are so many linux I will explain 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.400
 it would be impossible to upload in a single link 600 megawatts that users would 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.650
 will download 600 megawatts of blow would take them from six to eight hours in a 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 512 kbps connection 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.060
 imagine that 50 or 80 percent of the discharge of those 600 megawatts will be 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 will cut the connection or turn off your PC 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240
 obviously that is a total frustration 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 so if you cut the connection of a part of 6 then there is no problem you go back 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.479
 to download that same part 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.109
 everyone divides the programs to download in several links so that everything 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:16.329
 the world 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.289
 world can lower those that little by little 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.689
 point 3 on the contents of the folder of the 3d study max 9 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.459
 Inside the folder there will be 13 files but only three of them will not be interested. 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.189
 they 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.179
 1 z exact point 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.639
 with this we will install the program 3d studio max 9 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.919
 2 the text file called install hygiene 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.819
 there will come the written instructions on how to install this 3d max 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.899
 9 also includes three possible serial naners for when the installation 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:44.839
 I requested 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:49.579
 3 the exe file called 3d max 9 that I said mbaye esporte this will be the one 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.749
 They choose what we will use to register and authorize our installation 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.639
 now that they understood and understood all these points I am finished 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.989
 this first part 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.649
 if you have doubts you can write them in the youtube comments 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.939
 in the second part of the video I will show you how to install the program 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.709
 see you later 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.039
