00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.230
 hello, welcome to this class of 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.839
 English 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.810
 In this soul I'm going to talk about how 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:17.160
 build peaceful sentences in English in 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:22.120
 its most peaceful form a phrase is 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:27.340
 let us say, subject to a verb and 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:35.109
 a direct object for example in the phrase 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:37.030
 to and online the subject is what it means 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:43.510
 I 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:48.539
 the verb is a wiki that the verb likes and the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.100
 direct object is katz meaning cats 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.720
 in tauÃ¡ phrase 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.290
 ae laghi katz means I like 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.290
 cats 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:09.060
 and we can easily change the subject 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 for example that has already changed the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:21.660
 phrase for you like cats 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.940
 the old and we can also change the verb 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.510
 and put another verb in place of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.510
 olic 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.910
 so let's change the object directly and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:02:01.710
 Let's put pizza in place and the phrase 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:02:07.340
 will stay and now we will elaborate this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 sentence by placing an auxiliary verb 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:28.430
 means the phrase means and makes 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.430
 ever 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:47.209
 So let's change the auxiliary verb to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:47.209
 the verb that means sometimes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.770
 if you do not like pizza we can play 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.380
 the auxiliary verb again and let's put 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:04.890
 neva meaning I never ever like 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.830
 pizza is now to see how easy it is 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.790
 set up a peaceful phase in English and also 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.780
 set the direction of the sentence by adding a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 auxiliary verb or changing the subject o 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.209
 verb a direct object 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.880
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.880
 class a hug and see you soon
