00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.980
 good morning, we have breakfast today 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.100
 macaroni not just macaroni macaroni 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.110
 lovely 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.939
 Now we will boil in 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.279
 boiling salted water in general at the very 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.869
 business pasta for breakfast is stuff you 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.029
 I will say because pasta is slow 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.130
 carbohydrates slow carbohydrates is a lot 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.470
 energy and do not want to eat for a long time therefore 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.829
 nothing distracts us from our affairs 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.520
 id open id we boil them until the foam 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.269
 brewed 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.489
 cooking sauce with you is just fabulous 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.609
 Will I say that we have sauce today ? 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.190
 just royal this is shooting smoked 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.410
 meridia the thing is this is a product 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.170
 which is prepared without any 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.850
 use any preservatives there 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.800
 just from the street a little sea salt 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.190
 which is also very useful as the most important 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.409
 she rolls on slivers 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.840
 from the alder therefore it turns out gentle 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.700
 the delicate flavor is really 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.220
 delicacy and now we are based on this 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 salmon make a terrific sauce and so 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:24.200
 look take these slices and finely here 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:26.960
 we cut them into such straws 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.799
 small stewpot or even some 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.799
 such a cove 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:41.770
 here for example we warm up we add 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.180
 here a little butter 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:51.229
 well, that's how much is left just add 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.789
 somewhere a teaspoon let the butter melt 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:03.220
 opportunity to melt 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:03.220
 and add cream to butter 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:17.049
 in no case should the cream boil 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.810
 they just have to get hot while on 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.989
 low heat butter and cream 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.140
 warm thyme a few twigs 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.140
 thyme 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.510
 add right here to creamy 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:40.829
 oil sauce actually and this 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.829
 eat our sauce for our macaroni ff 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.299
 if thyme is not at hand that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.430
 quite possibly our latitudes can 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.620
 use dill salmon fine 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.780
 combined with dill 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.150
 cream with butter became hot but never 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.849
 In no case did we boil we add that 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.599
 These slices of our fish and more of the same 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.230
 our sauce was not returned to the fire just 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.090
 give the opportunity and salmon, too, warm up 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.319
 and soak in these creamy 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:21.400

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.590

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.090
 what else a couple of minutes and we will send them 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.760

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.900
