00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
finally have the horse rig for you so

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.830 
finally have the horse rig for you so
it's<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.029> bit<00:00:06.060> late<00:00:06.390> but<00:00:07.309> I<00:00:08.309> kind<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.179> had<00:00:09.450> some

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
it's a bit late but I kind of had some

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's a bit late but I kind of had some
issues<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.920> previous<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.849> recording

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
issues with my previous video recording

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.400 
issues with my previous video recording
software<00:00:12.750> chem<00:00:13.440> studio<00:00:13.980> ah<00:00:14.990> yeah<00:00:15.990> sorry<00:00:16.320> about

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
software chem studio ah yeah sorry about

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.790 
software chem studio ah yeah sorry about
that<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:18.090> yeah<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:19.710> i'm<00:00:19.859> using<00:00:19.920> OBS<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
that but yeah so now i'm using OBS and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.900 
that but yeah so now i'm using OBS and
yeah<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.160> appears<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.730> working

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
yeah that appears to be working

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.310 
yeah that appears to be working
relatively<00:00:24.660> well<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> rig<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.810> has

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
relatively well so on to the rig it has

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
relatively well so on to the rig it has
armor<00:00:32.070> which<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.550> turned<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.090> off

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
armor which can be turned on and off

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
armor which can be turned on and off
using<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> view<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.469> separate<00:00:37.980> bits

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
using the view it's in two separate bits

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.619 
using the view it's in two separate bits
because<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.980> have<00:00:40.980> two<00:00:41.399> separate<00:00:41.790> textures<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
because I have two separate textures so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.770 
because I have two separate textures so
that<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> armor<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:44.280> actually<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.820> shiny<00:00:45.120> if

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that the armor will actually be shiny if

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
that the armor will actually be shiny if
you<00:00:45.930> want<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> change<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.770> armor<00:00:47.160> type<00:00:47.370> from

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you want to change the armor type from

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.500 
you want to change the armor type from
gold<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> diamond<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.789> change<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
gold to diamond you can just change this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.160 
gold to diamond you can just change this
Gold's<00:00:52.350> 10<00:00:53.160> sorry<00:00:53.840> gold<00:00:54.840> 0<00:00:55.230> diamonds<00:00:55.800> one

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
Gold's 10 sorry gold 0 diamonds one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
Gold's 10 sorry gold 0 diamonds one
however<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.649> won't<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.219> change<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
however it won't actually change in the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.620 
however it won't actually change in the
Butte<00:01:00.570> viewport<00:01:01.530> until<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> restart<00:01:03.080> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
Butte viewport until you restart the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.330 
Butte viewport until you restart the
things<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> click<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
things so you could just click this and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.870 
things so you could just click this and
then<00:01:08.549> reset<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> that'll<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.070> reset<00:01:11.729> all

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then reset it and that'll just reset all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
then reset it and that'll just reset all
the<00:01:11.930> textures<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> stuff<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.280> also

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the textures and stuff you can also

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
the textures and stuff you can also
change<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> horse<00:01:15.299> type<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.320> i<00:01:16.350> might

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
change the horse type here so i might

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.570 
change the horse type here so i might
set<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:22.189> didn't<00:01:23.189> race<00:01:23.340> at

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
set it to one and then didn't race at

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
set it to one and then didn't race at
that<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.979> weird<00:01:26.750> all<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that time it's really weird all right I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.060 
that time it's really weird all right I
didn't<00:01:28.650> save<00:01:29.840> save

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
didn't save save

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.690 
didn't save save
no<00:01:32.840> wait<00:01:33.840> 0<00:01:34.470> 0<00:01:35.540> 1<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.780> minimum<00:01:37.370> save<00:01:40.700> yep

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
no wait 0 0 1 is the minimum save yep

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.719 
no wait 0 0 1 is the minimum save yep
and<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.510> changed<00:01:42.930> toward<00:01:43.200> zombie<00:01:43.470> horse

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.540 

you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.909> also<00:01:50.210> sorry<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> has<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:52.190> tail<00:01:53.190> which

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
you can also sorry it has a tail which

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.330 
you can also sorry it has a tail which
has<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:55.369> fabric<00:01:56.369> modifier<00:01:57.350> which<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.800> have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
has a fabric modifier which I have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.020 
has a fabric modifier which I have
currently<00:01:59.550> turned<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.729> click

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
currently turned off like if you click

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.389 
currently turned off like if you click
horse<00:02:03.390> tail<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.039> physics

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
horse tail and then go into the physics

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.330 
horse tail and then go into the physics
properties<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.660> turn<00:02:07.140> off<00:02:07.560> its<00:02:08.039> ring

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
properties you can turn off its ring

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
properties you can turn off its ring
debility<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> its<00:02:09.600> few<00:02:09.810> ability<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.500> you

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
debility and its few ability if you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.470 
debility and its few ability if you
don't<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.459> being<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.230> fabric<00:02:13.230> or<00:02:13.470> cloth

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
don't like it being a fabric or cloth

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.949 
don't like it being a fabric or cloth
but<00:02:15.530> otherwise<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.340> let<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> buffer

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.360 

apparently

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.580 

is<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.299> work<00:02:28.489> should<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.700> i<00:02:30.260> am<00:02:31.260> now

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
is it going to work should do i am now

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.089 
is it going to work should do i am now
it's<00:02:31.739> working<00:02:32.750> apparently<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.200> but

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
it's working apparently that's on but

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.789 
it's working apparently that's on but
yes<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.519> turns<00:02:35.819> off<00:02:36.060> whether<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.409> it

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
yes this turns off whether or not it

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.009 
yes this turns off whether or not it
renders<00:02:40.909> so<00:02:41.909> i'll<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.030> pull<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.599> it's<00:02:42.780> really

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
renders so i'll just pull so it's really

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:51.140 
renders so i'll just pull so it's really
lagging<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:48.920> okay<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.519> armatures

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
lagging and okay the armatures

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.530 
lagging and okay the armatures
relatively<00:02:51.810> simple<00:02:52.549> just<00:02:54.049> ik<00:02:55.049> bones<00:02:56.329> knee<00:02:57.329> ik

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
relatively simple just ik bones knee ik

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
bones jawbone ear bones bones for the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.330 
bones jawbone ear bones bones for the
straps<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> saddle<00:03:06.930> i<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.220> do

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
straps of the saddle i was going to do

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.599 
straps of the saddle i was going to do
it<00:03:08.459> fabric<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.349> that<00:03:10.349> didn't<00:03:11.129> turn<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.549> so

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
it fabric but that didn't turn out so

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:17.660 
it fabric but that didn't turn out so
well<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.090> i<00:03:12.450> changed<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.959> back<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:17.370> can't

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
well so i changed it back you can't

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.030 
well so i changed it back you can't
really<00:03:18.030> tell<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.599> on<00:03:18.750> any<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.500> ll<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.859> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
really tell it on any of the ll of the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.460 
really tell it on any of the ll of the
cut<00:03:20.310> types<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:21.060> horses<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.049> you've<00:03:22.290> actually

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
cut types of horses but you've actually

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.220 
cut types of horses but you've actually
got<00:03:22.829> nostrils<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.030> some<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.079> horses

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
got nostrils here so some of the horses

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.039 
got nostrils here so some of the horses
you'll<00:03:25.769> see<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.220> some<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.790> own<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.840> got

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
you'll see it on some you own you got

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.300 
you'll see it on some you own you got
ears<00:03:29.870> hooves<00:03:30.870> light<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.889> of<00:03:32.130> those<00:03:32.250> are

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
ears hooves light all of those are

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.150 
ears hooves light all of those are
extruded<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.359> that's<00:03:33.569> sort<00:03:33.810> quite<00:03:34.169> nice<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
extruded so that's sort quite nice the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920 
extruded so that's sort quite nice the
arm<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.519> three-dimensional<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
arm is three-dimensional and so is the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.390 
arm is three-dimensional and so is the
saddle<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:40.260> think<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.680> about<00:03:40.709> covers<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
saddle and I think that about covers it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.879 
saddle and I think that about covers it
