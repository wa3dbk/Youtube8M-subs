00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.889
 Here you can see the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.750
 Example of the quad core processor 1 4 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 gigahertz full hd playback and recording 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.270
 that means the thing can be full hd 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 record and then there are still many 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:55.489
