on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> other<00:02:01.229> side<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> same<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.299> back

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
on the other side the same way this back

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
on the other side the same way this back
is<00:02:03.899> sweeping<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> ball<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.009> over

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
is sweeping because the ball is over

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.410 
is sweeping because the ball is over
here<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.270> if

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
here but if

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 
here but if
the<00:02:06.479> bar<00:02:06.630> over<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.490> would<00:02:08.700> be

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the bar over here this back would be

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.320 
the bar over here this back would be
tight<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:11.280> forward<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.849> highlighted

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
tight this forward that's highlighted

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.140

here<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> very<00:02:12.930> important<00:02:13.760> sometimes<00:02:14.760> people

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
here is very important sometimes people

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.670 
here is very important sometimes people
who<00:02:15.209> are<00:02:15.300> playing<00:02:15.510> forward<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.380> that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
who are playing forward think that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.839 
who are playing forward think that
they're<00:02:16.920> up<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> score<00:02:17.819> goals

side away from the ball comes back and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.460 
side away from the ball comes back and
becomes<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> defender<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.270> other

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
becomes a defender just like the other

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
becomes a defender just like the other
facts<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.739> midfielders<00:02:29.340> back<00:02:29.520> here

this<00:06:02.760> talk<00:06:03.230> one<00:06:04.230> when<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.919> ball<00:06:05.100> is<00:06:05.130> on<00:06:05.370> this

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
this talk one when the ball is on this

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.610
