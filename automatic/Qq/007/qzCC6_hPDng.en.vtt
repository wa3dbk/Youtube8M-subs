00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.430
 no no 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.460
 but the fair world of carrara fishing does not 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.680
 could certainly miss one of the construction sites 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.520
 niche of the most demanding fishermen e 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 in this case the site to the field 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.210
 we are in company 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.480
 to the 21st 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480
 1 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 look at the grip mister has problems 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.579
 carbon 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.360
 mild designed thinking 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.550
 energy saving fiber 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.650
 carbon allows offering a figure 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.880
 very ria 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.600
 and that is counted 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.600
 for me 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.340
 lower then in courtyards management e 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.680
 obviously the reduced hottie is consumed 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.450
 compared to the competition but reduced in 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.480
 meaningful way we are talking about a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.480
 30 40 percent compared to that however 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.730
 of these times that of these times 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.130
 affects so much in terms of costs 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.159
 management 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.829
 and last but not least at the level of discourse 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 of environment pollution 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.490
 it is certain that one thing we have must 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.399
 also talk about this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 these terms here but let's talk about the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.510
 shipyard and especially of the boat 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.660
 because the boat is really a highlight 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.700
 of the sporting party in the sense that i 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.800
 best fishermen we can say that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.500
 they make these boats or at least the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.340
 threshold no you watch me leave 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 we produce four boats on the 19th 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.350
 25 30 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.659
 the feedback is very strong I say 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.690
 honestly, but just look at ours 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.650
 channels in ours 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.350
 in fact our seven page 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.570
 Facebook to almost 50 thousand followers 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.189
 and it is a huge response but not a 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.340
 Italian level huge response a 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.020
 world level 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.130
 also because the particularities of the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.649
 hull 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.240
 therefore of planning because we know 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.830
 which is however designed by yes 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.540
 the idea these boats of andrea via 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.299
 project and luco league 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.800
 the greatest executioner architect 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.640
 amal of the world 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.060
 absolutely 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 here talking about the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.860
 1 when we can say what are the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.210
 key features or the piece 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.400
 strong that we will encounter these 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.570
 meanwhile these boats hit from the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030
 aesthetic point of view the boats 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.819
 like 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.900
 then it's behind 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.790
 designs and technologies 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.129
 which causes this to be metallized 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 with a 150 horsepower it has consumption at 24 26 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.410
 knots of about one liter very little ming 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.720
 very much important data for us 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.970
 among other things they are data not detected by 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.460
 tests but detected by the owners of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.940
 in our boats they supply these 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.310
 data using taxes ie with others 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.780
 fishing leaders over with the full of 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.350
 gasoline and we are talking about the data of a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.900
 naked brand is certainly certainly absolutely 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.510
 so we want to remember besides the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.270
 facebook page you also have a site 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.350
 internet does not count who knows knows 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.080
 the whole world our internet world 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.750
 www.axn.it da lina tells you a site about 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.910
 blog phishing acts because it is a blog 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.010
 followed at this time monthly by 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.540
 about 15 thousand unique visitors per month 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.360
 we can say that you are champions not 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.520
 only in boats but also on blogs 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.170
 everything about the party for 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.330
 hundred are hiding secrets they are 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.050
 following a lot 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.800
 for us it is the product we see it is a 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.160
 fantastic beautiful product 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.920
 what to say if you want to see it of course 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.650
 we are live from the fishing world fair 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.000
 you will be present at other fairs for 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.100
 the year 2014 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.800
 then the first fair here because there 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.630
 we are in 2014 is a fair where I believe 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.980
 we will not see the Italian fishermen there 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.350
 we are addressing at this time to 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.000
 Turkish market so we will be in Istanbul a 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.130
 February this is the first appointment 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.400
 it already feels like we have all been 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.870
 all about a month ago and we were main 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.150
 sponsor of the most important tender 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.820
 probably of the Mediterranean in this 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.260
 moment 100 crews in the race was 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.340
 one thing is not but the weather conditions 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.890
 incredible hallucinatory race 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.840
 very difficult but really for us a 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.770
 very big commitment to sponsor level 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.199
 has been 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.030
 beautiful and a nice experience 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.410
 mainly he has also led the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.330
 find out for you that the next step 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.260
 as I said to you is participation in the 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.960
 life 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.240
 well we thank the construction site at 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.280
 chaste what to say so now it's over 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.910
 interview I can take the boat away 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.910
 we talk about it thanks to fallen rank
