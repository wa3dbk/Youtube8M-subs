00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.029
 bouquet of crepe paper roses 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.219
 We are going to need a sheet of paper 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.570
 I creped the color you like to make 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:17.200
 your mouth glue white water and a 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.320
 Unicel sphere we mix half of 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.720
 water with white glue we cut strips 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.259
 of crepe paper and fold them a little 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.540
 in half 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.360
 now we put some glue 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:32.079
 white at the beginning and we started to roll 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.310
 its rolled up has to be very weak 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 that is, not so stuck 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.930
 so that these separations from 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.930
 rolled up are the petals of your rose 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.960
 in various parts of your coiled vÃ©lez 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 putting white glue and also at 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.600
 final and in the back now 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.899
 Separate the petals a little bit and we go back 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.610
 to do another we're going to need several 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.150
 They may be the same color or 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 different 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.650
 You can also make larger roses or 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.200
 smaller depending on the length of your 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.590
 crepe paper cut the longer it is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.270
 the biggest strip is going to be your rose 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.160
 let's also do some reds for 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.160
 a new idea besides your wife 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.670
 do many for the ship more or less 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.479
 you need between 15 and 20 depending on the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 size of your flowers 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.070
 now since you have many we are going to 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.680
 grab the unicel sphere and let's go 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.330
 Pasting a formula we put in the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.800
 back a bit of glue 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.760
 White 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.770
 and above we stop it with a pin 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.800
 you can put one or two pins to your 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.170
 flower this makes it set perfectly 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.080
 and help you to dry the glue 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.820
 white let's fill your whole sphere 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 everywhere 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.490
 Now with a long vase, you can 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.500
 refill debug dry branches or you can 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.810
 fill also with water of what you 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 you want me to fill it in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 pure branches everywhere and above 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.800
 let's place the woman this is a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.890
 cute detail for a dessert table 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.970
 for a coffee table and even for a 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.790
 wedding for example 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 It looks spectacular and you can combine 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.349
 different heights of vases 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.599
 place it on your table will be amazing 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.450
 You can also use other colors of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.620
 crepe paper 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.870
 depending on the event you can do it in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.810
 blue yellow or white the color that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.939
 you want or fit a branch in between 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.450
 to make it taller you can also see 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.239
 cute now another idea is to make a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.390
 cardboard heart and fill it with 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.520
 pure roses 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.790
 remember the heart of the size that you 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.860
 want 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.079
 We put white glue on the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.810
 back and we are placing the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.689
 roses all over the heart 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.969
 if you have small or larger holes 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.200
 you can move them since the drying 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.209
 of the glue is slower now than you 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.030
 there are very small gaps 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.760
 a crepe paper ball and place it 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.700
 right where the holes are, it puts a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.349
 little bit of white glue and insert the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.769
 your holes so that the whole heart 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.190
 a heart is perfectly full 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.650
 full of roses 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.080
 you liked what we did with this super 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.570
 easy because we have much more ideas for 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.880
