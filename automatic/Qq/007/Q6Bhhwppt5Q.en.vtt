00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670 

okay<00:00:00.299> pull<00:00:00.630> it<00:00:00.930> over<00:00:01.079> it<00:00:01.439> like<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> triangle

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
okay pull it over it like a triangle

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.000 
okay pull it over it like a triangle
then<00:00:04.680> pretend<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.250> pieces<00:00:05.670> knock<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:07.010> fold

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
then pretend that pieces knock here fold

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.700 
then pretend that pieces knock here fold
this<00:00:08.220> over<00:00:10.519> so<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.639> another<00:00:12.710> smaller

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this over so you have another smaller

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:25.820 
this over so you have another smaller
triangle<00:00:16.490> fold<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:17.820> again<00:00:24.619> make<00:00:25.619> sure

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
triangle fold it over again make sure

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
triangle fold it over again make sure
your<00:00:25.980> points<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> same<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:32.420> okay<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
your points are the same way okay and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.770 
your points are the same way okay and
then<00:00:33.989> fold<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.710> again<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> whole

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
then fold it over again you have a whole

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.130 
then fold it over again you have a whole
bunch<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> edges<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.969> fat<00:00:39.300> line<00:00:41.809> yep<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
bunch of edges and one fat line yep I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
bunch of edges and one fat line yep I
got<00:00:45.170> them<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.920> inside<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.730> find<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
got them look inside just find the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.510 
got them look inside just find the
smallest<00:00:50.000> on<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> outside<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:55.250> Abby<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
smallest on the outside to Abby and I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.609 
smallest on the outside to Abby and I
folded<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.289> cut<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> off<00:00:58.800> they're

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:14.780 

all<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.010> same<00:01:08.210> no<00:01:10.850> cut<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:13.409> section<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:14.369> if

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
all the same no cut this section off if

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
all the same no cut this section off if
you<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:16.070> points<00:01:17.119> like<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you want to have points like this if you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.179 
you want to have points like this if you
don't<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:20.850> cut<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.240> piece

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
don't want if you don't cut this piece

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
don't want if you don't cut this piece
you're<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.310> end<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:24.000> stuff<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.720> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you're gonna end up with stuff like that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're gonna end up with stuff like that
where<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.280> round<00:01:26.549> circle<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:32.299> I'll

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
where it's all one round circle so I'll

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.010 
where it's all one round circle so I'll
just<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> quick<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:35.750> show<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just do a quick one just show you what I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.520 
just do a quick one just show you what I
mean<00:01:40.310> cut<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> short

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.760 

so<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:45.680> shorter<00:01:46.190> than<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.530> now<00:01:48.530> you're

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
so it's shorter than that now you're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.070 
so it's shorter than that now you're
going<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.950> cut<00:01:49.160> cut<00:01:49.490> cut<00:01:49.700> cut<00:01:49.940> cut<00:01:50.120> cut<00:01:50.390> cut<00:01:50.600> cut

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
going to cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.260 
going to cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut
cut<00:01:51.320> everywhere<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.250> want<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.700> leave<00:01:53.060> as

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
cut everywhere you want and leave as

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.660 
cut everywhere you want and leave as
little<00:01:53.570> paper<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.320> can<00:01:54.500> impossible<00:01:55.160> just

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
little paper as you can impossible just

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.300 
little paper as you can impossible just
don't<00:01:56.000> cut<00:01:56.300> all<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.660> way<00:01:56.750> across<00:01:57.160> we're<00:01:58.160> all

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
don't cut all the way across we're all

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.800 
don't cut all the way across we're all
the<00:01:58.460> way<00:01:58.580> across<00:01:58.820> or<00:01:59.240> you'll<00:01:59.390> cut<00:01:59.630> your

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the way across or you'll cut your

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.400 
the way across or you'll cut your
snowflake<00:02:00.260> so<00:02:01.190> when<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.520> pull<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.880> apart<00:02:02.410> see

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
snowflake so when you pull it apart see

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.170 
snowflake so when you pull it apart see
how<00:02:03.530> you're<00:02:03.680> gonna<00:02:03.740> have<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.130> points<00:02:05.170> voila
