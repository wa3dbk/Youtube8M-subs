00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.890
 They then make it to the hall alive 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.719
 sven was generous and has maps for 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 the inner area worried what 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.210
 On the one hand, that means something different from the one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.559
 show noticed 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.059
 on the other hand , that we are the same 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 are underserved because each gang too 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.449
 one of the bar with half of it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.470
 hour lasts that means you can 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.090
 Immediately again for the next 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 to put beer on, so we move 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.180
 so not only in this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.769
 vicious circle when we wait and the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 bear band and then wait again 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.099
 is always a mobile again 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 serve beer by the audience 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.859
 but the student with his back 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 Canister and the tap in hand 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.040
 manages to easily exist in the crowd 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.930
 potential customers large-scale 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 dodge 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 with minimal sip from the cup in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 which we bought directly after the inlet 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 to have 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.260
 but seems like it gets dark off 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 Let it be easy to drop it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.620
 now it's gonna be like evans for it 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 I need all the hands I have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 next to us is a young girl with that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.510
 not quite sure yet 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.010
 Planning had appeared as the fourth day 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 and reminds me that got me times 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
 to feel a bit old again though 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.079
 just a little bit of the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 Audience turn me as unsuspecting 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 chick looks at the little one has 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 freshly printed macon shirt on natural 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.739
 with the cover motif of the current 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 slice and is so hippleig that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.869
 I do not know if I have that now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.040
 kind of cute or just 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.110
 should find annoying 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 then the stage becomes sinister 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 dim light bathed the intro 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 Sounds and the girl tears the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 little arms up and yelling with crimson 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 head and one somewhere in between 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.140
 explosion and mickey mouse and co 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.740
 if and I use down and pull 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 she is high but there is nothing to do 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.420
 the little knocked out we lift her 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 call me up and give 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 it to our front people on them 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.229
 continue to give up until the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.229
 security can take care of it 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 Poor thing she probably comes 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 in time for the end of the award again 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 to himself and then the band is right 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 stage and I tear up the arms and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.800
 eyeglasses report flare and higher with it 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.220
 the next two hours either 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.220
 back up
