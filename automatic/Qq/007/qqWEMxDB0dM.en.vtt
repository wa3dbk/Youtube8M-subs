00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.640 
who showed promise at the end of last
year<00:02:43.669> now<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> year<00:02:44.629> older<00:02:45.049> got<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.470> bit

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
year now a year older got a little bit

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.309 
year now a year older got a little bit
my<00:02:45.799> experience<00:02:46.340> they're<00:02:46.669> developing<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.480> so

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
my experience they're developing so so

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.849 
my experience they're developing so so
although<00:02:48.919> we<00:02:49.189> are<00:02:49.220> still<00:02:49.639> a<00:02:49.669> young<00:02:49.849> squad

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
although we are still a young squad

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.500 
although we are still a young squad
they'll<00:02:51.859> they'll<00:02:52.250> be<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.549> major<00:02:52.909> games<00:02:53.299> for

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
they'll they'll be the major games for

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.599 
they'll they'll be the major games for
us<00:02:53.599> i<00:02:53.689> think<00:02:53.719> this<00:02:53.989> year<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.439> they<00:02:55.010> can<00:02:55.219> play

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
us i think this year that they can play

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.449 
us i think this year that they can play
where<00:02:56.389> they<00:02:56.540> could<00:02:56.719> probably<00:02:56.930> get<00:02:57.650> five<00:02:58.430> or

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
where they could probably get five or

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.149 
where they could probably get five or
six<00:02:58.760> games<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.389> then<00:03:00.019> they'll<00:03:00.439> tell<00:03:00.680> arrestor

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
six games and then they'll tell arrestor

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.009 
six games and then they'll tell arrestor
can<00:03:01.340> probably<00:03:01.639> do<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> bit<00:03:01.969> more<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.359> that's<00:03:02.569> you

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
can probably do a bit more so that's you

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.289 
can probably do a bit more so that's you
know<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.700> evolution<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.849> team<00:03:05.060> is

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299
