00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 here we are again friends of the web in the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.220
 kitchen of the wonders of my personal 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.049
 tv trainer 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 the list of buzz preparations in 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.700
 kitchen is really infinite therefore 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.509
 let's roll up our sleeves and see a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:21.630
 what fate has given us 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.000
 we mix we see very good sponge cake 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 the cocoa vivaldi to prepare with me 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 for today I would like to propose you in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 oldest variant so before 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 work well with whips 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.520
 electric eggs and sugar 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.469
 we're going to warm it up a little bit then 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.149
 appears to cook until you get to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.020
 50 degree temperature 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 prepare together to prepare in pan 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 of Spain and cocoa are required 100 g 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 of white flour in type 00 30 grams of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 potato starch 15 grams of cocoa 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 bitter powder 140 grams of sugar 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.989
 granulated a pinch of salt and 4 new 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 inter 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.689
 the first thing to do is to shell them 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.990
 whole eggs and place them in a saucepan 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 as I did then we add everything 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.939
 granulated sugar and then with whips 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
 electrical 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.630
 let's start to mix a little bit until 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.850
 reaching a temperature of 50 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 degrees 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.880
 if you don't have a thermometer you can 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 simply check when on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.250
 board on the saucepan data in all 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 began to become clearer later 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.280
 then 23 minutes of whisk tour 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 the mass inside the saucepan 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.970
 reached the temperature of 50 degrees 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 so we turned it off 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.579
 now let's just transfer it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 the compound you see is already a bit 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.799
 frothy inside the mixer 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 electric with the container but why 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.380
 do this because 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.810
 Loose sugar makes it more stable 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.360
 the mass is the foam if it forms first 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.430
 so now we can proceed with the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.219
 classic method we have seen for the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.829
 the classic sponge cake action if 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.750
 you want to see click here then 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.450
 slam for goods in all with the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 electric whisk medium high speed 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.650
 about 15 minutes after a couple of minutes 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.230
 whisk with electric whips 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.139
 I recommend adding a little salt 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.769
 so that the foam stabilizes a 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.900
 bit before 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.719
 as you can see the thermometer 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.639
 I was watching the temperature is known 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.040
 that after a couple of minutes the 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.579
 temperature has reached 42 degrees 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 if used, always feel the thermometer 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.700
 you must arrive at a temperature of 30 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.549
 degrees 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.709
 after that it means that the compound of 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.359
 eggs and sugar will be ready to be 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.359
 mixed with powders 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.530
 after 15 minutes of whips led that this 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.959
 the result 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.389
 as you can see the foam a lot 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.500
 fluffy and stable you see that not that 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.019
 there 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.239
 slowly from the spoon in the meantime 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:21.109
 I also took a diameter artery 22 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.479
 buttered and floured 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:27.689
 now we have to combine the powders with the 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:29.930
 egg and sugar mixture so like 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.799
 let's take a colander 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:39.930
 if we first make the white flour of 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.370
 type 00 starch is not necessary 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.019
 sift it anyway we sift that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.099
 that since we have the colander 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:51.810
 ready and then the perfect bitter cocoa e 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.069
 now with a spoon 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.310
 but let's mix all the powders 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.400
 then these are going to add plan 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.989
 plan to our compound because plan 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.220
 high on your mind the whole thing is 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.769
 collapses so let's do so a 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.259
 spoon at a time and scatter it 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:19.349
 on the surface gently and then with 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.989
 equally delicate movements we go 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.560
 to incorporate the powders as I am 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.419
 doing me 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.570
 so don't rush to do 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.500
 this operation because this is one 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.460
 critical phase 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.130
 if you remove the eggs then it's a 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.639
 disaster because the sponge cake does not 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.710
 it will be more beautiful soft so let's proceed 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.710
 so until all the powders are exhausted 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.590
 we have therefore blended perfectly 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.690
 the powders and now we are pouring this 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.729
 goodness on the pan we keep away for 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.440
 well all the cream with a spatula 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.510
 therefore we learn to always use the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.300
 leca pendulum called also marisa 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.860
 but to remove well from the walls 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.169
 all the compound 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.440
 ok now we see them a little 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.550
 and let's bake at 180 degrees for 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.550
 about 30 minutes 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.060
 the sort therefore did not exist at all 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.250
 antwerp 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.560
 we got wonderful pan of 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.640
 spain and cocoa with the oldest method 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.380
 then we have the first cooking 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.300
 eggs with sugar until 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.850
 50 degree temperature 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.979
 I have already detached a little piece of the 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.440
 cake to show you the wonderful 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.120
 softness of this sweet 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.039
 so now all we have to do is activate 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.770
 the mechanisms of our imagination e 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.520
 stuff cocoa sponge cake like 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.710
 the more we like it 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.120
 thank you for your attention and expect 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.120
 in my next certain videos
