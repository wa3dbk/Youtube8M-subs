pricing so to access materials manager

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
pricing so to access materials manager
you<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.080> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> button<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:38.120> within<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you go to the button here and within the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
you go to the button here and within the
materials<00:00:39.750> manager<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.470> product

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
materials manager you have product

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.210 
materials manager you have product
categories<00:00:42.059> along<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> left<00:00:43.320> hand<00:00:43.559> side<00:00:43.830> here

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
categories along the left hand side here

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.080 
categories along the left hand side here
and<00:00:44.600> then<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:47.250> hierarchy

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and then you have a different hierarchy

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then you have a different hierarchy
of<00:00:48.390> products<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> parent<00:00:50.280> level<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of products so at the parent level you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.160 
of products so at the parent level you
can<00:00:50.969> toggle<00:00:51.239> off<00:00:51.649> or<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.430> entire<00:00:53.760> series<00:00:54.239> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
can toggle off or on an entire series so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
can toggle off or on an entire series so
say<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:56.010> tonnes<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.579> available<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.120> your

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
say one tonnes are not available in your

say one tonnes are not available in your
market<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.989> toggle<00:00:58.170> those<00:00:58.469> right

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
market you can just toggle those right

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.819 
market you can just toggle those right
off<00:00:59.270> or<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.539> there's<00:01:00.750> particular<00:01:01.050> depths<00:01:01.800> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
off or if there's particular depths that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.060 
off or if there's particular depths that
you<00:01:02.070> never<00:01:02.309> want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:04.070> possible

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you never want to see as a possible

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
you never want to see as a possible
solution<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.149> do<00:01:06.300> that<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.660> as
