00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.800 
high-pitched horrible squeaky weren't
just<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.760> want<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.970> hear<00:03:56.120> I'll<00:03:56.480> show<00:03:56.750> you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
just what you want to hear I'll show you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:11.540 
just what you want to hear I'll show you
some<00:03:57.370> yeah

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.050 

but<00:04:12.120> destoyed

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.520 

doesn't<00:04:18.060> sound<00:04:18.209> too<00:04:18.389> bad<00:04:18.570> though<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.320> bass<00:04:19.500> is

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
doesn't sound too bad though the bass is

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:36.460 
doesn't sound too bad though the bass is
okay<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:22.229> then<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:23.639> just<00:04:23.940> gets<00:04:24.150> worse<00:04:34.610> anyway

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
okay but then it just gets worse anyway

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.350 
okay but then it just gets worse anyway
it's<00:04:37.470> quite<00:04:37.650> good<00:04:37.800> concept<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.850> suppose<00:04:39.090> I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
it's quite good concept I suppose I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.450 
it's quite good concept I suppose I
suppose<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.840> concept<00:04:40.320> quite<00:04:40.560> quite<00:04:41.250> good

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
suppose of the concept quite quite good

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.689 
suppose of the concept quite quite good
and<00:04:42.380> there<00:04:43.380> are<00:04:43.410> some<00:04:43.740> materials<00:04:43.860> where<00:04:44.430> it

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
and there are some materials where it

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.570 
and there are some materials where it
actually<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.650> incredibly<00:04:46.650> loud<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.280> mirror

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
actually is incredibly loud the mirror

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.879 
actually is incredibly loud the mirror
in<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:47.940> bathroom<00:04:48.500> blows<00:04:49.500> your<00:04:49.770> head<00:04:49.949> off<00:04:49.979> but

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
in the bathroom blows your head off but

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.980 
in the bathroom blows your head off but
it<00:04:52.889> does<00:04:53.280> seem<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.610> bit<00:04:53.639> pointless<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.389> keep<00:04:54.720> on

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
it does seem a bit pointless to keep on

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.629 
it does seem a bit pointless to keep on
the<00:04:55.199> mirror<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> bathroom<00:04:55.800> it's<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.370> cool

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
the mirror in the bathroom it's a cool

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.439 
the mirror in the bathroom it's a cool
idea

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
idea

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.350 
idea
not<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.380> good<00:04:58.560> for<00:04:58.919> practical<00:04:59.610> use<00:05:02.360> that's

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
not so good for practical use that's

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.940 
not so good for practical use that's
what<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> sounds<00:05:03.960> like<00:05:04.020> not<00:05:04.889> on<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.039> surface<00:05:05.490> and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.550 

I<00:05:07.980> mean<00:05:08.880> it's<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.120> good<00:05:09.330> idea<00:05:09.480> but<00:05:10.050> it's<00:05:10.200> just

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
I mean it's a good idea but it's just

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.860 
I mean it's a good idea but it's just
definitely<00:05:11.550> not<00:05:11.820> good<00:05:12.240> for<00:05:12.270> practical<00:05:12.840> use

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
definitely not good for practical use

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.150 
definitely not good for practical use
you're<00:05:13.140> gonna<00:05:13.230> have<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.470> have<00:05:13.710> some<00:05:13.920> sort<00:05:14.130> of

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
you're gonna have to have some sort of

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.700 
you're gonna have to have some sort of
glass<00:05:14.370> table<00:05:14.970> for<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:16.110> get<00:05:16.260> any<00:05:16.410> good

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
glass table for you to get any good

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.500 
glass table for you to get any good
sound<00:05:17.130> out<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:19.700> yeah<00:05:20.700> basically<00:05:23.510> it's

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
sound out of and yeah basically it's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.140 
sound out of and yeah basically it's
pretty<00:05:24.750> dire<00:05:25.370> unfortunately<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.910> I've<00:05:27.000> got

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
pretty dire unfortunately and I've got

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.470 
pretty dire unfortunately and I've got
three<00:05:27.390> other<00:05:27.510> things<00:05:28.700> anyway<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:30.180> has<00:05:30.300> been

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
three other things anyway this has been

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.600 
three other things anyway this has been
