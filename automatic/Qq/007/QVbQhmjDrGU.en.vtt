00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the exploration because on one of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
the exploration because on one of the
interviews<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.809> Kakashi

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
interviews with them it's you Kakashi

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.350

said<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> dolls<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.430> only<00:00:50.910> for

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
said that the dolls are not only for

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.029

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
combat but they're also for exploration

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.760 
combat but they're also for exploration
so<00:00:53.730> could<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.030> finally<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.440> dolls

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so could we finally see what these dolls

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
so could we finally see what these dolls
can<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> open<00:00:57.030> world<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.420> far<00:00:57.449> as

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
can do in the open world as far as

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
can do in the open world as far as
exploring<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.649> could<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.070> something<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
exploring that could be something to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
exploring that could be something to
look<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.420> far<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.109> general

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
look out for as far as my general

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.930 
look out for as far as my general
predictions<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.340> they're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> do

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
predictions of what they're going to do

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
predictions of what they're going to do
I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> little

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I think that we're going to get a little

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
I think that we're going to get a little
taste<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> online<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
taste of the online but I do have a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
taste of the online but I do have a
little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.710> bad<00:01:07.979> news<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
little bit of bad news that might be a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
little bit of bad news that might be a
downer<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.240> some<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.560> guys

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
around with your friends but that might
not<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.640> case<00:01:20.939> basically<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> an

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
not be the case basically because of an

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
not be the case basically because of an
interview<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.130> mitsui<00:01:23.520> he<00:01:23.700> said<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
interview with that mitsui he said that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.219 
interview with that mitsui he said that
it's<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> normal

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's not going to be like a normal

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
it's not going to be like a normal
online<00:01:25.650> game<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
online game it's going to kind of be

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
online game it's going to kind of be
like<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> loosely<00:01:27.450> connected<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.229> something

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
like a loosely connected or something

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
like a loosely connected or something
like<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.040> might<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.460> been<00:01:29.579> lost<00:01:29.820> in

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like that it might have been lost in

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
like that it might have been lost in
translation<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> wait<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.500> see

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
translation so we have to wait and see

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
translation so we have to wait and see
but<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.159> might<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:33.000> taste<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.509> what

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
but we might get the first taste of what

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.749 
but we might get the first taste of what
that<00:01:33.780> online<00:01:34.229> play<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.070> limited<00:01:35.520> connectivity

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that online play or limited connectivity

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.999 
that online play or limited connectivity
is<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> other<00:01:37.290> players<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

april so it's nothing is to get people

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.119 
april so it's nothing is to get people
hyped<00:03:01.150> because<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.659> seems<00:03:01.930> like<00:03:02.049> japan<00:03:02.859> yet

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.009 
hyped because it seems like japan yet
they<00:03:03.519> were<00:03:03.579> into<00:03:04.000> xenoblade<00:03:04.480> chronicles<00:03:04.510> a

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
they were into xenoblade chronicles a

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.410 
they were into xenoblade chronicles a
little<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:05.409> but<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.739> did<00:03:05.920> way<00:03:06.310> better<00:03:06.639> here<00:03:06.970> in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
little bit but it did way better here in

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.910 
little bit but it did way better here in
North<00:03:07.629> America<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:08.409> it<00:03:08.500> even<00:03:08.530> did<00:03:08.889> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
North America and I think it even did a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.500 
North America and I think it even did a
little<00:03:08.980> bit<00:03:09.310> better<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.730> Europe<00:03:10.000> I'm<00:03:10.150> not<00:03:10.299> one

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
little bit better in Europe I'm not one

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.610 
little bit better in Europe I'm not one
hundred<00:03:10.569> percent<00:03:10.750> sure<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.260> might<00:03:11.379> have<00:03:11.530> been

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
hundred percent sure it might have been

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.619 
hundred percent sure it might have been
tied<00:03:11.889> or<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.489> think<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.909> probably<00:03:12.940> did<00:03:13.510> better

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
tied or I think it probably did better

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.569 
tied or I think it probably did better
year<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.260> did<00:03:14.470> really<00:03:14.919> good<00:03:15.250> here<00:03:15.489> in

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
year but it did really good here in

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
coverage otherwise they would not have

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.650 
coverage otherwise they would not have
it<00:04:35.620> at<00:04:35.770> 10pm<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.820> would<00:04:36.940> have<00:04:37.030> had<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.330> at<00:04:37.570> a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
it at 10pm it would have had it at a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.780 
it at 10pm it would have had it at a
time<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.080> was<00:04:38.140> more<00:04:38.350> Japanese<00:04:38.860> friendly<00:04:39.310> but

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
time that was more Japanese friendly but

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.250 
time that was more Japanese friendly but
this<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.090> not<00:04:40.210> Japanese<00:04:40.750> friendly<00:04:41.110> at<00:04:41.230> all
