really gonna play a factor was a pc game

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.410 
really gonna play a factor was a pc game
oh<00:01:59.340> what's<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.490> day<00:02:00.640> game<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.060> night<00:02:01.180> game

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
actually might um you know just already

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.000 
actually might um you know just already
have<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.150> our<00:02:19.239> belt<00:02:19.540> plan<00:02:19.920> under<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
have that on our belt plan under the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.030 
have that on our belt plan under the
lights<00:02:21.269> in<00:02:22.269> front<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.630> big<00:02:22.780> audience<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
lights in front of a big audience and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.860 
lights in front of a big audience and
we've<00:02:24.190> done<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.790> years<00:02:24.940> passed<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.569> as

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
we've done in the years passed to as

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
we've done in the years passed to as
well<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.190> definitely<00:02:27.280> plays<00:02:27.640> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
well and I think it definitely plays a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.820 
well and I think it definitely plays a
factor<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.269> not<00:02:28.480> getting<00:02:29.380> caught<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.769> a

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
factor and not getting caught up in a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.620 
factor and not getting caught up in a
moment<00:02:30.010> looking<00:02:30.519> around<00:02:30.850> seeing<00:02:31.269> all<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
moment looking around seeing all the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.710 
moment looking around seeing all the
cool<00:02:31.959> stuff<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.160> being<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.180> confident

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
cool stuff and just being a confident

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.090 
cool stuff and just being a confident
yourself<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.200> can't<00:02:35.410> perform<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
yourself that you can't perform and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.330 
yourself that you can't perform and
situations<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.830> personal<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.890> fact<00:02:39.130> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
situations like that personal in fact I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.479 
situations like that personal in fact I
almost<00:02:39.940> winter<00:02:40.209> Jarvis<00:02:40.799> sure<00:02:41.799> he's<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.220> are

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
almost winter Jarvis sure he's going are

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.130 
almost winter Jarvis sure he's going are
you<00:02:42.670> starting<00:02:43.360> field<00:02:43.540> we're<00:02:43.690> talking<00:02:44.019> when

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you starting field we're talking when

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
you starting field we're talking when
you're<00:02:44.290> rolling<00:02:44.530> out

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you're rolling out

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.030 
you're rolling out
more<00:02:45.930> elevator<00:02:46.290> all<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> children

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
more elevator all the children

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.070 
more elevator all the children
absolutely<00:02:47.849> earlier<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> year<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.990> was

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
absolutely earlier in the year I was

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.630 
absolutely earlier in the year I was
playing<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.440> lot<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> different<00:02:49.920> positions<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
playing a lot of different positions and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.570 
playing a lot of different positions and
I<00:02:51.380> still<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.650> from<00:02:52.800> time<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.340> time<00:02:53.370> but

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
I still do that from time to time but

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.270 
I still do that from time to time but
now<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.330> I've<00:02:54.390> played<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.709> position<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
now that I've played a one position a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.460 
now that I've played a one position a
lot<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> lot<00:02:57.000> more<00:02:57.030> reps<00:02:57.360> there<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.380> lot

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
lot get a lot more reps there and a lot

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.839 
lot get a lot more reps there and a lot
more<00:02:58.530> passes<00:02:59.010> thrown<00:02:59.160> my<00:02:59.310> way<00:02:59.340> I'm<00:02:59.580> definitely

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
more passes thrown my way I'm definitely

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.620 
more passes thrown my way I'm definitely
starting<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.239> feel<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> lot<00:03:00.599> more

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
starting to feel a lot more

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.050 
starting to feel a lot more
uncomfortable<00:03:01.020> at<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:02.010> position<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.910> help

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
uncomfortable at that position so help

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120 
uncomfortable at that position so help
you<00:03:03.180> some<00:03:03.959> chemistry<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> conscious<00:03:04.950> well

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you some chemistry of conscious well

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.830 
you some chemistry of conscious well
you're<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> same<00:03:06.180> spot<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.660> you're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
you're in the same spot you know you're

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.510 
you're in the same spot you know you're
in<00:03:06.989> going<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> same<00:03:07.830> routes<00:03:08.040> over<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.459> over

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
in going the same routes over and over

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.250 
in going the same routes over and over
again<00:03:08.640> yeah<00:03:09.000> definitely<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.630> because<00:03:10.110> every

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
again yeah definitely on because every

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.660 
again yeah definitely on because every
position<00:03:10.560> has<00:03:10.830> its<00:03:11.010> different<00:03:11.250> routes<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
position has its different routes and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.699 
position has its different routes and
timing<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.989> be<00:03:13.050> able<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.319> rip<00:03:13.530> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
timing and just to be able to rip that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.229 
timing and just to be able to rip that
every<00:03:13.980> day<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.220> practice<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.819> get<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> timing

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
every day in practice and get the timing

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.570 
every day in practice and get the timing
down<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.870> good<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:16.769> me<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:16.980> Tasha<00:03:17.190> for

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
down it's a good for me and Tasha for

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.550 
down it's a good for me and Tasha for
our<00:03:17.670> chemistry<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.870> put<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.200> many<00:03:19.290> different

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
our chemistry you put so many different

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
our chemistry you put so many different
positions<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.640> high<00:03:20.819> school<00:03:21.120> did<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> ever

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
positions in high school did you ever
