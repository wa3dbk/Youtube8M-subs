click on it a certain partition it'll

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.610 
click on it a certain partition it'll
just<00:02:32.040> erase<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.120> partition<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.500> this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
just erase that partition but in this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.500 
just erase that partition but in this
case<00:02:34.829> we're<00:02:35.069> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.760> erase<00:02:36.269> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
case we're going to just erase the

case we're going to just erase the
entire<00:02:36.750> drive<00:02:37.340> now<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.790> works<00:02:39.030> both<00:02:39.360> ways

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
entire drive now this works both ways

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.149

the format now ms-dos which is f80
format<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:56.160> Windows<00:02:56.489> uses<00:02:56.989> for<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.319> know

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
format is what Windows uses for you know

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.380 
format is what Windows uses for you know
flash<00:02:59.010> drives<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.579> things<00:02:59.609> like<00:03:00.060> that

going to come shipped with and of course
you<00:03:10.079> could<00:03:10.230> spend<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> extra<00:03:10.680> money<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.390> buy

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
you could spend the extra money and buy

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.869 
you could spend the extra money and buy
the<00:03:12.450> Mac<00:03:13.019> version<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:14.040> these<00:03:14.220> external<00:03:14.579> hard

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
the Mac version of these external hard

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.479 
the Mac version of these external hard
drives<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.329> it's<00:03:15.510> much<00:03:15.750> easier<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.560> buy

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
drives but it's much easier just to buy

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.900 
drives but it's much easier just to buy
the<00:03:17.970> plain<00:03:18.599> old<00:03:18.900> version<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.889> just<00:03:19.919> format<00:03:20.819> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
the plain old version and just format it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.099

because I know manufacturers like to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.670 
because I know manufacturers like to
mark<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:24.870> stuff<00:03:25.139> like<00:03:25.200> that
