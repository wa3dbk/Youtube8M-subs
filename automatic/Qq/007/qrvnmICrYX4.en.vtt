00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.690 
um visually it's just stunning all
around<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.530> think<00:03:42.590> George<00:03:43.010> Miller<00:03:43.280> when<00:03:43.519> he

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
around I think George Miller when he

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.500 
around I think George Miller when he
made<00:03:43.909> this<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.269> 1979<00:03:44.989> with<00:03:45.230> Mel<00:03:46.190> Gibson<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.940> was

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
made this in 1979 with Mel Gibson it was

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.789 
made this in 1979 with Mel Gibson it was
it<00:03:48.379> was<00:03:48.769> good<00:03:49.040> um<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:50.379> enjoyed<00:03:51.379> it

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
it was good um I enjoyed it

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.800 
it was good um I enjoyed it
but<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.340> think<00:03:52.459> now<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.120> they<00:03:53.540> have<00:03:53.689> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
but I think now that they have the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.559 
but I think now that they have the
technology<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.859> they<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.760> money<00:03:56.060> and

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
technology and they have the money and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.920 
technology and they have the money and
just<00:03:57.340> more<00:03:58.540> accessibility<00:03:59.540> to<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.909> his<00:04:01.930> vision

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
just more accessibility to it his vision

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.170 
just more accessibility to it his vision
it<00:04:03.139> can<00:04:03.319> fully<00:04:03.709> come<00:04:04.010> alive<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.700> its<00:04:04.879> full

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
it can fully come alive to its full

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.589 
it can fully come alive to its full
extent<00:04:05.750> especially<00:04:06.739> with<00:04:06.920> such<00:04:07.489> great<00:04:08.030> CGI
