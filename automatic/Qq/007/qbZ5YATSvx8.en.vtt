00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.940
 salts and solar systems 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.149
 when legislation things solar cells occurs current 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.119
 direct 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.849
 this energy will travel from the solar cells has become 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.189
 which converts direct energy to alternating current 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.310
 which will be used to produce electricity for your home 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:28.189
 the energy for your lights your appliances the air conditioning is now produced 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.329
 for the Sun 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.050
 and the same system that also produces current for your pool equipment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 and outside lamination equipment 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410
 when more energy is produced 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.170
 what is being used 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 This excess energy will be returned to your utility company 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.890
 and you will notice it is an electricity meter spinning back 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 I understand his death of solar energy to the service company at the same 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 price they are happy 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.080
 to sell her auster 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.190
 solar pool heating 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.980
 a solar sensor 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.430
 the peeling will send ap tom a signal to your solar control system 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.290
 when solar energy can start heating your pool 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.490
 when this happens 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 your dollar valves will open automatically 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.119
 and will direct 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.100
 the water the sun 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.550
 cristina azria 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 this installation of pools are people get tired 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 When the water in your pool reaches the desired temperature 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 your pool heating system 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 will wait for the signal to try to agree the taxi driver 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.180
 this will happen automatically at the end of the filtration cycle 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.439
 and the collectors will be canceled 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.889
 scares by heating the temperature of your steps so you can enjoy 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.400
 with warm simplicity 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.000
 although another dk 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Hot water 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.249
 so much for the norm 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.930
 hot water decades and electricity 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.909
 it has to be a thing of the past 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.629
 40 gallons of water will be qualified by the sun 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.999
 and when hot water is needed in your house 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.089
 this same solar chamber 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.250
 it will be emplaced 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.259
 the hot water of your traditional heater 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.159
 or zintan heater 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.159
 preventing these appliances 30 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.229
 free solar hot water 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:34.499
 cerati replaced their washing machines dishwashers bathrooms 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.569
 Many countries in the world already have solar hot water 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.859
 as technology is so much 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.149
 and clearly 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.809
 it is time for us to also adopt this simple mixed 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.189
 in our daily lives 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.679
 I visited Sanchez 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.169
 widen the solar 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.369
 pollan health
