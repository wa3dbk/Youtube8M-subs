00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
have to do first lick find this is you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660 
have to do first lick find this is you
need<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.930> any<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.470> any<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
need to get to any are any of these to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.540 
need to get to any are any of these to
wear<00:00:20.910> regolith<00:00:21.510> range<00:00:21.869> exits<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.100> i<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
wear regolith range exits so i take this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.650 
wear regolith range exits so i take this
one<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:23.850> i<00:00:24.000> find<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.449> bit

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
one because i find it a little bit

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910 
one because i find it a little bit
quicker<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.830> as

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
quicker but you can take that one as

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880 
quicker but you can take that one as
well<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.250> fine<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
well that's fine and what you do is you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.120 
well that's fine and what you do is you
head<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.910> area<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
head to this area here on it's like a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
head to this area here on it's like a
little<00:00:32.250> path<00:00:32.550> there<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.989> you'll

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
little path there right and then you'll

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
little path there right and then you'll
see<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> new<00:00:34.739> dis<00:00:35.250> dis<00:00:35.520> m/s<00:00:36.360> reg<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> it's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
see the new dis dis m/s reg and it's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930 
see the new dis dis m/s reg and it's
called<00:00:37.200> Fupa<00:00:37.829> chthonic<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.640> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
called Fupa chthonic and it's like it's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
called Fupa chthonic and it's like it's
supersonic<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.840> ph<00:00:40.200> understand<00:00:40.620> very

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
supersonic but with ph understand very

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729 
supersonic but with ph understand very
much<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.030> Fupa<00:00:42.329> phonic<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> cragun

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
much so Fupa phonic and it's a cragun

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
much so Fupa phonic and it's a cragun
and<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.309> bright<00:00:44.579> yellow<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and it's like bright yellow so it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
and it's like bright yellow so it's
obviously<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> yellow<00:00:46.860> supersonic

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
obviously it's the yellow supersonic

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760 
obviously it's the yellow supersonic
right<00:00:47.640> every<00:00:48.360> time<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.690> hit<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.050> it'll<00:00:49.590> drop

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
right every time you hit it it'll drop

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
right every time you hit it it'll drop
money<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> kill<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:50.969> exploded<00:00:51.719> money

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
money and if you kill it exploded money

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.970 
money and if you kill it exploded money
so<00:00:51.989> i'm<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> show<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.770> guys

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
okay so as you can see you trolled me a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
okay so as you can see you trolled me a
little<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> gold<00:01:25.350> cragun

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
little bit there but it's a gold cragun

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
little bit there but it's a gold cragun
that<00:01:26.220> obviously<00:01:26.549> he's<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> balloon<00:01:27.119> he

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that obviously he's got the balloon he

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.350 
that obviously he's got the balloon he
does<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> spin<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:29.180> what<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.270> gonna

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
does a spin there right what we're gonna

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590 
does a spin there right what we're gonna
do<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:31.470> hit<00:01:31.740> him<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> sec<00:01:32.600> right

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
do is we're gonna hit him in a sec right

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.910 
do is we're gonna hit him in a sec right
so<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.170> there's<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.470> spin

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so as you can see there's that spin
