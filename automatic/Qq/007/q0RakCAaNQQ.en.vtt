00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.510 

so<00:00:08.110> this<00:00:08.410> is<00:00:08.560> our<00:00:08.740> new<00:00:08.980> creation<00:00:11.460> decided<00:00:12.460> to

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
so this is our new creation decided to

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.040 
so this is our new creation decided to
call<00:00:12.700> it<00:00:12.820> a<00:00:12.910> zoom<00:00:13.150> of<00:00:13.180> our<00:00:13.420> pets<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.950> kind<00:00:15.310> of

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.050 
call it a zoom of our pets this kind of

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.950 
call it a zoom of our pets this kind of
resembles<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.910> similar<00:00:18.910> tea<00:00:19.180> boiler<00:00:19.630> that

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
resembles the similar tea boiler that

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.530 
resembles the similar tea boiler that
they<00:00:20.800> have<00:00:21.040> here<00:00:21.310> so<00:00:21.640> we'll<00:00:22.150> give<00:00:22.329> them<00:00:22.419> an

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
they have here so we'll give them an

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
they have here so we'll give them an
idea<00:00:23.400> fire<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.520> burning<00:00:24.759> inside<00:00:25.029> a<00:00:25.210> stack<00:00:25.599> and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
idea fire is burning inside a stack and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.589 
idea fire is burning inside a stack and
as<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.489> can<00:00:27.610> see<00:00:27.669> it's<00:00:27.970> growing<00:00:28.540> and<00:00:29.050> burning

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
as you can see it's growing and burning

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.930 
as you can see it's growing and burning
very<00:00:31.599> nicely<00:00:31.899> and<00:00:34.410> by<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.579> construction<00:00:36.579> is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
very nicely and by the construction is

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.290 
very nicely and by the construction is
four<00:00:37.420> parts<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.460> bottom<00:00:39.640> bucket

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
four parts there's the bottom bucket

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.420 
four parts there's the bottom bucket
kind<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.809> thing<00:00:41.019> there's<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.649> inner<00:00:41.800> tube<00:00:42.219> in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
kind of thing there's the inner tube in

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240 
kind of thing there's the inner tube in
the<00:00:42.519> solid<00:00:42.850> iron<00:00:43.449> that<00:00:43.899> is<00:00:44.050> welded<00:00:44.469> there<00:00:45.160> is

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
the solid iron that is welded there is

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.740 
the solid iron that is welded there is
an<00:00:45.460> upper<00:00:46.090> bucket<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.969> going<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.449> be<00:00:49.510> an

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
an upper bucket there's going to be an

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.529 
an upper bucket there's going to be an
insulator<00:00:50.410> around<00:00:52.589> the<00:00:53.589> hip<00:00:53.739> riser<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.329> maybe

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
insulator around the hip riser so maybe

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.119 
insulator around the hip riser so maybe
we<00:00:55.660> can<00:00:56.070> keep<00:00:57.070> them<00:00:57.929> you<00:00:58.929> can<00:00:59.079> see<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.440> well

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
we can keep them you can see that well

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.110 
we can keep them you can see that well
it's<00:01:01.120> hard<00:01:01.359> with<00:01:01.570> all<00:01:01.749> that<00:01:02.519> humidity<00:01:03.519> coming

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
it's hard with all that humidity coming

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.620 
it's hard with all that humidity coming
up<00:01:04.239> there<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:09.130> burning<00:01:09.630> fiercely

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
up there and but it's burning fiercely

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.500 
up there and but it's burning fiercely
inside<00:01:11.200> there<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.520> can<00:01:12.940> see<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> smoke

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
inside there and you can see the smoke

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.540 
inside there and you can see the smoke
is<00:01:13.750> close<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.170> nothing

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
is close to nothing

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.920 
is close to nothing
just<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.330> little<00:01:16.630> bit<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.810> ash<00:01:17.050> flying<00:01:17.980> around

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just a little bit of ash flying around

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.220 
just a little bit of ash flying around
and<00:01:24.360> yeah<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.390> think<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:25.870> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.080> work

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
and yeah I think it's going to work

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.490 
and yeah I think it's going to work
tomorrow<00:01:26.830> we're<00:01:27.280> going<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:28.050> put<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.140> lid<00:01:29.320> on

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
tomorrow we're going to put the lid on

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.400 
tomorrow we're going to put the lid on
and<00:01:30.150> hopefully<00:01:31.150> in<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.630> evening<00:01:31.930> we<00:01:32.110> can<00:01:32.230> burn

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
and hopefully in the evening we can burn

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.480 
and hopefully in the evening we can burn
inside<00:01:32.770> our<00:01:32.950> house

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
inside our house

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.780 
inside our house
we'll<00:01:34.390> see<00:01:34.660> how<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:35.020> eats<00:01:35.170> up<00:01:35.580> it's<00:01:36.580> pretty

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
we'll see how it eats up it's pretty

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.960 
we'll see how it eats up it's pretty
cold<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.240> our<00:01:37.360> kitchen<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:39.610> thinking

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
cold in our kitchen so I was thinking

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.270 
cold in our kitchen so I was thinking
that<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.540> will<00:01:42.030> try<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.060> out<00:01:43.240> there

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.469 

and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.620 

inside<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> bucket<00:01:52.650> is<00:01:53.009> filled<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.630> clay

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
inside the bucket is filled with clay

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
inside the bucket is filled with clay
and<00:01:54.659> sawdust<00:01:55.380> mix<00:01:55.770> around<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.400> heat<00:01:56.580> tube<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and sawdust mix around the heat tube and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.660 
and sawdust mix around the heat tube and
then<00:01:57.210> clay<00:01:57.570> over<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.680> cop<00:02:01.680> kind<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
then clay over there and so cop kind of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.389 
then clay over there and so cop kind of
mix<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.600> makes<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> heavy<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.740> stable

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
mix and that makes it heavy and stable

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.080 
mix and that makes it heavy and stable
and<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:07.080> also<00:02:07.380> makes<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.950> retain<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and it also makes it retain some of the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.559 
and it also makes it retain some of the
heat

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
heat

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.520 
heat
I<00:02:10.640> got<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> where<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.239> will<00:02:12.660> weight<00:02:12.870> around<00:02:13.020> 50

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I got it where it will weight around 50

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.630 
I got it where it will weight around 50
kilos<00:02:13.950> when<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.520> done<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.980> portable

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
kilos when it's done so it's portable

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
kilos when it's done so it's portable
but<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.560> easy<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.190> move<00:02:20.550> around<00:02:21.140> that's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
but it's not easy to move around that's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.690 
but it's not easy to move around that's
okay<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:24.180> gonna<00:02:24.450> move<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.840> once<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.200> year<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
okay I'm gonna move it once a year so I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.620 
okay I'm gonna move it once a year so I
also<00:02:26.940> hope<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.480> can

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.440 

because<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.950> gaseous<00:02:32.490> has<00:02:32.850> cooled

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
because of that the gaseous has cooled

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.000 
because of that the gaseous has cooled
down<00:02:34.100> down<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.280> barrel<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.880> hope<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> can

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
down down the barrel I hope that I can

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.940 
down down the barrel I hope that I can
get<00:02:38.010> away<00:02:38.130> with<00:02:38.460> using<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.970> four<00:02:39.540> inch<00:02:39.840> tube<00:02:40.710> as

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
get away with using a four inch tube as

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.340 
get away with using a four inch tube as
well<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> time<00:02:42.330> move<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> don't

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
well just this time move but I don't

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.290 
well just this time move but I don't
know<00:02:43.470> yet<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:46.970> there's<00:02:47.970> still<00:02:48.090> some

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
know yet so there's still some

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.710 
know yet so there's still some
experiments<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.560> done<00:02:49.940> but<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.270> far<00:02:51.510> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
experiments to be done but so far so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.130 
experiments to be done but so far so
good

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
good

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
good
I<00:02:52.170> think<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> costs<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.030> around

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
I think the costs of this will be around

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.960 
I think the costs of this will be around
50<00:02:54.600> minute<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.930> maybe<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:59.550> sell<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.940> with

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
50 minute and that maybe to sell it with

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.220 
50 minute and that maybe to sell it with
