of plants respectively the results of
those<00:01:47.310> tests<00:01:47.700> reveal<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> closer<00:01:48.509> a

tumbleweed population permanently so how

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
tumbleweed population permanently so how
do<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.079> feel<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.469> tumbleweeds<00:02:02.100> should

do you feel about tumbleweeds should

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520 
do you feel about tumbleweeds should
they<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> exterminated<00:02:03.090> let<00:02:03.840> us<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.110> in
