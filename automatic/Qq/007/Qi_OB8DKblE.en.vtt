the<00:01:07.080> moon<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.070> Pisces<00:01:08.729> conjunct<00:01:09.240> Neptune

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the moon is in Pisces conjunct Neptune

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410 
the moon is in Pisces conjunct Neptune
and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.050> think<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.410> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.590> godsend<00:01:11.420> literally

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and I think this is a godsend literally

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
and I think this is a godsend literally
whatever<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.259> dealing<00:01:13.530> with

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
whatever you have anything dealing with

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
whatever you have anything dealing with
Neptune<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.250> definitely<00:01:14.580> God<00:01:14.759> energy<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
Neptune is definitely God energy but I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.540 
Neptune is definitely God energy but I
think<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.200> important<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.430> have

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
think it is so important because we have

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.609 
think it is so important because we have
just<00:01:17.700> spent<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.940> last<00:01:18.030> five<00:01:18.540> days<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> full

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just spent the last five days of a full

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.680 
just spent the last five days of a full
moon<00:01:19.860> energy<00:01:20.340> coming<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.910> Capricorn<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
moon energy coming off of Capricorn and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.810 
moon energy coming off of Capricorn and
Aquarius<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.500> isn't<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.860> best<00:01:23.040> energy<00:01:23.250> for

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
Aquarius which isn't the best energy for

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
Aquarius which isn't the best energy for
cancer<00:01:24.780> energy<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> where<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> Sun<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
cancer energy which is where the Sun is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
cancer energy which is where the Sun is
and<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:26.820> Jupiter's<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.420> its<00:01:27.570> last

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and this is where Jupiter's on its last

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.380 
and this is where Jupiter's on its last
final<00:01:28.170> full<00:01:28.560> day<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.330> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
final full day here so there's been a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
final full day here so there's been a
lot<00:01:30.630> about<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:31.050> emotions<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> getting<00:01:32.670> out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
lot about our emotions and getting out

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
lot about our emotions and getting out
of<00:01:33.060> crappy<00:01:33.330> feelings<00:01:33.930> trying<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> find

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of crappy feelings trying to find

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.889 
of crappy feelings trying to find
comfort<00:01:35.220> having<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.580> be<00:01:35.670> professional<00:01:36.360> having

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
comfort having to be professional having

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.890 
comfort having to be professional having
to<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.410> find<00:01:37.649> an<00:01:37.830> escape<00:01:38.360> out<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> bad

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to try and find an escape out of bad

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.120 
to try and find an escape out of bad
feelings<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.770> today<00:01:40.890> we're

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
feelings and I think today we're

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.530 
feelings and I think today we're
starting<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> comforts<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> home

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
starting to get the comforts of home

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.570 
starting to get the comforts of home
back<00:01:42.900> especially<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:43.650> very<00:01:43.920> intuitive

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
back especially this is a very intuitive

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.000 
back especially this is a very intuitive
day<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> very<00:01:45.120> emotional<00:01:45.479> positive<00:01:46.229> day<00:01:46.380> but

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
day a very emotional positive day but

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.710 
day a very emotional positive day but
where<00:01:47.190> is<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.400> all<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> lost

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
where is it all going there is a lost

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
where is it all going there is a lost
kind<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.170> imaginative<00:01:49.710> energy<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.310> today<00:01:50.580> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
kind of imaginative energy of today and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.320 
kind of imaginative energy of today and
we're<00:01:51.510> being<00:01:51.690> almost<00:01:52.610> drifted<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
we're being almost drifted out to this

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.039 
we're being almost drifted out to this
kind<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.690> weird<00:01:54.960> paradigm<00:01:55.500> today<00:01:55.830> into

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
kind of weird paradigm today into

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
kind of weird paradigm today into
preparation<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> Sun<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
preparation that's because the Sun is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
preparation that's because the Sun is
going<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.760> big<00:02:00.150> square<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> north

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
going to make a big square to the north

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
going to make a big square to the north
node<00:02:01.470> today<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.850> opinion<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
node today and this in my opinion is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
node today and this in my opinion is
really<00:02:04.049> powerful<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.430> also<00:02:05.640> making<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
really powerful this is also making a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.100 
really powerful this is also making a
square<00:02:06.119> root<00:02:06.150> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.330> South<00:02:06.510> node<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.020> we're

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
square root of the South node so we're

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.750 
square root of the South node so we're
having<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.409> big<00:02:07.680> t<00:02:07.950> square<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.459> nodes

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
having this big t square with the nodes

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520 
having this big t square with the nodes
in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> Sun<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:09.899> checkpoint

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
in the Sun and this is your checkpoint

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.590 
in the Sun and this is your checkpoint
this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.459> checkpoint<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> universe

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
this is your checkpoint of the universe

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.110 
this is your checkpoint of the universe
ready<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.170> check<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.280> you're<00:02:14.430> ready<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.760> step

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
while it's coming into a new moon so

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.090 
while it's coming into a new moon so
this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.870> really<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.739> some

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
this is really going to be about some

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.130 
this is really going to be about some
powerful<00:02:29.519> action<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.209> our<00:02:30.330> life<00:02:30.540> some

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
powerful action in our life some

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.640 
powerful action in our life some
powerful<00:02:32.269> clarity<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.390> what<00:02:33.959> actions<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.500> need

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
powerful clarity on what actions we need

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.319 
powerful clarity on what actions we need
to<00:02:34.739> take<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.100> well<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
to take as well so this is going to be

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.880 
to take as well so this is going to be
pressure<00:02:36.959> though<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.799> be

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
pressure though it's not going to be

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.990 
pressure though it's not going to be
simple<00:02:38.310> you're<00:02:38.430> definitely<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> have

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
simple you're definitely going to have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
simple you're definitely going to have
to<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.299> decisions<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.989> Libra<00:02:40.290> doesn't<00:02:40.560> like

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
to make decisions and Libra doesn't like

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.020 
to make decisions and Libra doesn't like
to<00:02:40.769> make<00:02:40.920> full<00:02:41.160> decisions<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:41.850> there's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
to make full decisions because there's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.360 
to make full decisions because there's
so<00:02:42.150> much<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.480> intellectually<00:02:43.080> way<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.410> but

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
so much to intellectually way out but

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.680 
so much to intellectually way out but
it's<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> also<00:02:45.209> deal<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.450> your

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it's going to also deal with your

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.000 
it's going to also deal with your
emotions<00:02:45.810> very<00:02:46.290> intensely<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> think

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
emotions very intensely and I think

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.230 
emotions very intensely and I think
that's<00:02:47.160> why<00:02:47.310> we've<00:02:47.489> gone<00:02:47.760> through

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.030 
that's why we've gone through
much<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.600> weird<00:02:48.840> emotion<00:02:49.200> recently<00:02:49.860> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
much of this weird emotion recently is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.960 
much of this weird emotion recently is
to<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:52.320> want<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.970> think

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
to really know what we want I think

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.730

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
at the end of this weekend into the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.740 
at the end of this weekend into the
beginning<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.130> next<00:03:11.190> week<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.360> universe

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
beginning of next week so the universe

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.000 
beginning of next week so the universe
is<00:03:12.870> about<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.170> bring<00:03:13.290> shift<00:03:13.620> after<00:03:13.860> shift

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
is about to bring shift after shift

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.180 
is about to bring shift after shift
after<00:03:14.400> shift<00:03:14.550> after<00:03:14.970> shift<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:16.200> today<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
after shift after shift so today is the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
after shift after shift so today is the
checkpoint<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.120> my<00:03:18.660> opinion<00:03:18.960> because<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.500> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
checkpoint in my opinion because this is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.740 
checkpoint in my opinion because this is
the<00:03:19.770> last<00:03:19.950> day<00:03:20.130> pre<00:03:20.550> shifting<00:03:21.030> although<00:03:21.720> I

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the last day pre shifting although I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
the last day pre shifting although I
still<00:03:21.900> think<00:03:22.350> we're<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.770> shifting<00:03:23.100> today

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
still think we're kind of shifting today

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.280 
still think we're kind of shifting today
I<00:03:23.520> think<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> more<00:03:24.180> important<00:03:24.570> aspect<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.110> are

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
I think the more important aspect is are

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.900 
I think the more important aspect is are
you<00:03:25.350> ready<00:03:25.560> today<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.460> of<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.580> day<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> be

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.760 
you ready today is kind of a day to be
clear<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:28.170> pay<00:03:28.320> attention<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
clear on this to really pay attention to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.710 
clear on this to really pay attention to
what<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.010> signs<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.270> where<00:03:30.510> your

imagination draws to where are you being
pulled<00:03:33.000> towards<00:03:33.420> where<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.780> God<00:03:33.990> pulling<00:03:34.500> you

clear today and I think the universe is
going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.600> give<00:03:39.780> some<00:03:40.020> comforts<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.560> have

your bead on track it'll be whether or
not<00:03:48.240> you're<00:03:48.420> ready<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.780> take<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.170> action<00:03:49.200> or

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
not you're ready to take the action or

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.320 
not you're ready to take the action or
not<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.340> Sun<00:03:50.550> really<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.970> starting<00:03:51.270> at

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
square to Mars on top of that mercury

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.760 
square to Mars on top of that mercury
hits<00:03:53.880> its<00:03:54.150> shadow<00:03:54.510> period<00:03:55.110> ending<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.620> this

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
hits its shadow period ending so this

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.260 
hits its shadow period ending so this
means<00:03:55.920> mercury<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.820> is<00:03:56.970> where<00:03:57.120> mercury

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
means mercury this is where mercury

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.840 
means mercury this is where mercury
retrograde<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.230> today<00:03:58.560> another<00:03:59.430> clear

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
retrograde and today another clear

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.670 
retrograde and today another clear
signal<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.450> universe<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
signal that the universe is really at a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.740 
signal that the universe is really at a
checkpoint<00:04:02.400> position<00:04:03.030> because<00:04:03.300> now<00:04:03.420> mercury

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
checkpoint position because now mercury

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.200 
checkpoint position because now mercury
is<00:04:04.050> coming<00:04:04.350> off<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:05.340> big<00:04:05.610> freeze<00:04:05.940> frame

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
is coming off of this big freeze frame

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.540 
is coming off of this big freeze frame
that<00:04:06.390> we<00:04:06.480> had<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.290> know<00:04:07.320> weeks<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.220> weeks<00:04:08.280> and

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
that we had you know weeks and weeks and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.280 
that we had you know weeks and weeks and
over<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.790> month<00:04:09.060> ago<00:04:09.210> and<00:04:09.360> now<00:04:09.810> we're<00:04:10.020> ready<00:04:10.050> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
over a month ago and now we're ready to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.380 
over a month ago and now we're ready to
move<00:04:10.500> forward<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.850> think<00:04:12.240> is

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
move forward and it really a think is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.270 
move forward and it really a think is
signaling<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.110> when<00:04:13.290> tomorrow<00:04:13.680> Jupiter<00:04:14.100> comes

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
signaling is when tomorrow Jupiter comes

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.980 
signaling is when tomorrow Jupiter comes
into<00:04:14.490> leo<00:04:14.640> mercury<00:04:15.120> comes<00:04:15.390> out<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.810> full

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
into leo mercury comes out of the full

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.200 
into leo mercury comes out of the full
shadow<00:04:16.260> period<00:04:16.710> and<00:04:16.950> more<00:04:17.280> importantly<00:04:17.700> we're

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
shadow period and more importantly we're

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.910 
shadow period and more importantly we're
just<00:04:18.420> ready<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.750> kind<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.020> blast<00:04:19.290> off<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.830> this

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
just ready to kind of blast off in this

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.349 
just ready to kind of blast off in this
new<00:04:20.070> direction<00:04:20.220> with<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.730> Sun<00:04:20.940> square<00:04:21.180> Mars

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
new direction with the Sun square Mars

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.980 
new direction with the Sun square Mars
exactly<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.950> big<00:04:23.760> check<00:04:23.970> point<00:04:24.180> today<00:04:24.330> where's

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
exactly so big check point today where's

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.510 
exactly so big check point today where's
the<00:04:25.140> universe<00:04:25.440> pulling<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.830> are<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.250> ready

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the universe pulling you are you ready

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.220 
the universe pulling you are you ready
do<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:26.790> your<00:04:26.910> bags<00:04:27.210> packed<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:28.140> know

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
do you have your bags packed you know

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.690 
do you have your bags packed you know
this<00:04:28.410> could<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> day<00:04:28.920> where<00:04:29.220> maybe<00:04:29.490> it's

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
this could be a day where maybe it's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.490 
this could be a day where maybe it's
frustrating<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.360> you're<00:04:30.510> not<00:04:30.720> able<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.350> get

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
frustrating if you're not able to get

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.780 
frustrating if you're not able to get
things<00:04:31.710> together<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.250> you're<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.550> have<00:04:32.670> to

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
things together and you're and I have to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.040 
things together and you're and I have to
find<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.180> way<00:04:33.210> because<00:04:33.480> maybe<00:04:33.720> you're<00:04:33.930> being

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
find a way because maybe you're being

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.500 
find a way because maybe you're being
drifted<00:04:34.560> or<00:04:34.710> your<00:04:34.860> your-your-your<00:04:35.370> lost<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
drifted or your your-your-your lost a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.390 
drifted or your your-your-your lost a
little<00:04:36.630> bit<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.200> today<00:04:37.350> listen<00:04:38.310> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
little bit and I think today listen to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.280 
little bit and I think today listen to
the<00:04:38.490> signs<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.030> start<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.420> put<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.780> work<00:04:39.990> in

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
the signs and start to put the work in

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.650 
the signs and start to put the work in
and<00:04:40.470> get<00:04:41.130> prepared<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.790> take<00:04:41.970> some<00:04:42.180> actions<00:04:42.540> in

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and get prepared to take some actions in

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.030 
and get prepared to take some actions in
your<00:04:42.780> life<00:04:42.930> because<00:04:43.260> there<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.530> definitely

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
your life because there is definitely

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.250 
your life because there is definitely
some<00:04:44.640> really<00:04:44.910> big<00:04:45.030> shifts<00:04:45.450> especially

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
some really big shifts especially

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.450 
some really big shifts especially
starting<00:04:46.560> tomorrow<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.190> last<00:04:47.340> day

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
starting tomorrow this is the last day

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.250 
starting tomorrow this is the last day
of<00:04:47.550> Jupiter<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.120> cancer<00:04:48.540> which<00:04:48.960> has<00:04:49.080> been<00:04:49.230> a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
of Jupiter and cancer which has been a

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.960 
of Jupiter and cancer which has been a
year<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.590> really<00:04:49.890> looking<00:04:50.190> at<00:04:50.310> your<00:04:50.430> emotions

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
year of really looking at your emotions

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.580 
year of really looking at your emotions
and<00:04:51.210> what<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.720> really<00:04:51.870> feel<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.320> your<00:04:52.410> life

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
and what you really feel in your life

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.350 
and what you really feel in your life
where<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.950> want<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.190> root<00:04:53.340> yourself<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:54.000> I

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
where you want to root yourself and I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.540 
where you want to root yourself and I
think<00:04:54.420> we<00:04:54.750> are<00:04:54.870> pretty<00:04:55.080> much<00:04:55.250> clear<00:04:56.250> today

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
think we are pretty much clear today

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.820 
think we are pretty much clear today
where<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.540> place<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.290> card<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.650> day

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
where that place is the card of the day

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.230 
where that place is the card of the day
is<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.850> eight<00:05:00.120> of<00:05:00.300> wands<00:05:00.570> reversed

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
is the eight of wands reversed

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.420 
is the eight of wands reversed
so<00:05:03.240> this<00:05:03.570> can<00:05:03.750> be<00:05:03.780> we're<00:05:04.140> sure<00:05:04.680> maybe<00:05:05.190> things

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
so this can be we're sure maybe things

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.680 
so this can be we're sure maybe things
are<00:05:05.610> trying<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:05.940> move<00:05:06.060> forward<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:06.540> they're

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
are trying to move forward but they're

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.150 
are trying to move forward but they're
not<00:05:06.780> moving<00:05:06.990> forward<00:05:07.380> exactly<00:05:07.980> because

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
not moving forward exactly because

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.070 
not moving forward exactly because
there's<00:05:08.490> still<00:05:08.700> some<00:05:08.940> pause<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.960> is

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
there's still some pause this is

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.840 
there's still some pause this is
definitely<00:05:10.440> kind<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.740> pause<00:05:11.040> day<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
definitely kind of a pause day in the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.430 
definitely kind of a pause day in the
universe<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.510> Sun<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.020> going<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.260> make

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
universe is the Sun is going to make

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.190
