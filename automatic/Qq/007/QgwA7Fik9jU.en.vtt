usually a lot of my work focuses on like
a<00:00:08.930> new<00:00:09.410> technique<00:00:09.830> that<00:00:10.160> I<00:00:10.370> haven't<00:00:10.610> played

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
a new technique that I haven't played

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.060 
a new technique that I haven't played
with<00:00:11.299> before<00:00:11.510> like<00:00:12.019> using<00:00:12.350> effects<00:00:12.740> in<00:00:12.980> the

through these bursts of colored powder
the<00:00:32.239> thing<00:00:32.449> that<00:00:32.599> was<00:00:32.719> awesome<00:00:33.379> about<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
the thing that was awesome about the

the thing that was awesome about the
Miro<00:00:34.219> is<00:00:34.489> that<00:00:34.670> we<00:00:34.789> could<00:00:34.910> go<00:00:35.149> into<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.840> forest

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
Miro is that we could go into the forest

Miro is that we could go into the forest
and<00:00:36.739> like<00:00:37.039> tuck<00:00:37.489> it<00:00:37.609> in<00:00:37.730> between<00:00:37.940> two<00:00:38.420> trees<00:00:39.019> or

camera action you don't need to use the

whole clip you can just set in and out

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.090 
whole clip you can just set in and out
on<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:59.239> moment<00:00:59.659> that<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.870> need<00:01:00.100> download

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
on the moment that you need download

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.399 
on the moment that you need download

again<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.670> could<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:07.940> pretty<00:01:08.149> efficient<00:01:11.680> all

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
again you could be pretty efficient all

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.789 
again you could be pretty efficient all
the<00:01:12.920> powder<00:01:13.130> stuff<00:01:13.549> was<00:01:13.939> done<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.840> 1500<00:01:15.619> frames

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
the powder stuff was done at 1500 frames

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.969 
the powder stuff was done at 1500 frames
that<00:01:16.219> gives<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.640> about<00:01:17.110> 2.7<00:01:18.110> seconds<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:18.770> real

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that gives you about 2.7 seconds in real

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.819 
that gives you about 2.7 seconds in real
time<00:01:19.600> most<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.869> stuff<00:01:21.200> was<00:01:21.320> captured<00:01:21.740> with

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
time most of the stuff was captured with

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.889 
time most of the stuff was captured with
a<00:01:21.890> post<00:01:22.189> trigger<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.090> cameras<00:01:23.420> always<00:01:23.689> in

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
a post trigger so the cameras always in

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.810 
a post trigger so the cameras always in
record<00:01:24.259> mode<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:24.740> always<00:01:24.979> looping<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:25.640> then

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
record mode it's always looping and then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.940 
record mode it's always looping and then
we<00:01:25.939> used<00:01:26.180> an<00:01:26.359> end<00:01:26.570> trigger<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.469> only<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
we used an end trigger so that only the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.440 
we used an end trigger so that only the
last<00:01:28.100> three<00:01:28.460> seconds<00:01:28.880> are<00:01:29.060> saved

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
last three seconds are saved

we<00:01:32.460> shut<00:01:32.640> everything<00:01:33.000> raw<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.500> Vinci

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
we shut everything raw we use the Vinci

we shut everything raw we use the Vinci
resolve<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.670> transfer<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.660> ProRes<00:01:37.410> we

brought<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.550> into<00:01:38.850> premiere<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.290> was

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
brought that into premiere and I was

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.740 
brought that into premiere and I was
able<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.250> rough<00:01:41.940> green<00:01:42.390> screen

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
able to do just rough green screen

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.140 
able to do just rough green screen
passes<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> could<00:01:43.740> easily<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.460> key<00:01:44.760> out<00:01:44.910> the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
passes I could easily just key out the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.730 
passes I could easily just key out the
figures<00:01:45.480> and<00:01:45.720> kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.200> figure<00:01:46.410> out<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
figures and kind of like figure out the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
figures and kind of like figure out the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
timing and the speed from there I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
timing and the speed from there I
bounced<00:01:49.710> everything<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> after-effects

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
bounced everything that after-effects

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.070 
bounced everything that after-effects
