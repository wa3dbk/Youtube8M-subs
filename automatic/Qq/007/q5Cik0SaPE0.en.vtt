00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 if we remember 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 we always have a definition, therefore it corresponds to the number 400 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 macri 400 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.719

 now we can read all the letters though 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710

 the statement we have in two strokes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 first stroke and second stroke 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.180
 do not confuse them with the letter 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 the letter g if I would write like this 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 instead of these having the end song 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.570

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 we also practice the examples

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:41.299
 plus 60 i +8 400 that the treaty 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.729
 60 would be the 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.219
 what 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.309
 i the a8 points 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.429
 471 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:54.369
 400 more 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.369
 70 thousand plus a 430 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.930
 the 70 fails and the 1 the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.759
 we have 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:07.099
 471 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.359
 Remember that the EU is practicing both numbers and writing 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.840
 and then you are tempted by the environment correctly, so to do in writing is convicted 20 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.239
 in the next class we will study them exception 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.139
 that is, the one time we had seen before in the unit manuel lanzini 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.400
 it works without points that the right as sh100 points 3 remains like that in we'll see 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.249
 face 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.069
 and the box 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:45.649
 we will see 7 na understand me in its end we have plan a pillar nuncio fitch 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.780
 in 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.219
 and increasingly demanding the reporting of these cases 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.870
 and once we have seen these cases 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.870
 then with sofas up to a section that are imported sounds worth 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.170
 for example I have continued to report as we reported example quoted 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.139
 percent I calculate that there will be Cubans 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 between you all eight days more 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.759
 between eight and fifteen days more I do not know how it is not totally contrary to the 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.440
 time that with character eminently tracks according to characteristics that are not 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.120
 can explain with a set when taking advantage 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.290
 i we are going to count so that wedge 50 work to write 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.739
 and with this out, we'll start with the drama classes 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.410
 for now we have finished with the 22 metastatic of the Hebrew alphabet i by 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.169
 one hundred 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.310
 as much luck and a lot of practice and we are not together anymore
