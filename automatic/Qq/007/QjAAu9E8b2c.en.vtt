leash game around testers so we're first
of<00:00:07.470> all<00:00:07.620> we'll<00:00:08.370> go<00:00:08.610> go<00:00:09.360> into<00:00:09.929> rocket<00:00:10.650> leech

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
of all we'll go go into rocket leech

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:24.510 
of all we'll go go into rocket leech
game

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.740

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.479 
create match so joining the blue team
and<00:00:40.390> as<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:42.440> can<00:00:42.680> see<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:44.360> game<00:00:44.660> lags<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.710> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
and as you can see the game lags and the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.680 
and as you can see the game lags and the
performance<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.570> very<00:00:47.629> low<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.830> as<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:50.450> can

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
performance is very low and as you can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.760 
performance is very low and as you can
see<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.580> significant<00:00:52.629> low<00:00:53.629> bonus<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:55.610> VPS

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
see the significant low bonus of the VPS

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.200 
see the significant low bonus of the VPS
so<00:00:58.000> we're<00:00:59.000> gonna<00:00:59.239> change<00:01:00.280> something<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:02.030> order

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
so we're gonna change something in order

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.460 
so we're gonna change something in order
to<00:01:02.510> get<00:01:02.690> higher<00:01:03.019> performance<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:05.330> I'm<00:01:05.510> simply

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
to get higher performance so I'm simply

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.730

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.750 

so<00:02:13.490> I'm<00:02:13.760> creating<00:02:14.030> too<00:02:14.630> much<00:02:14.870> again<00:02:18.760> running

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so I'm creating too much again running

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.330 
so I'm creating too much again running
blue<00:02:20.000> tea<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:23.140> now<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.590> see<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> game<00:02:26.780> is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
blue tea and now you can see the game is

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.550 
blue tea and now you can see the game is
at<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:29.209> higher<00:02:29.690> performance<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:33.410> is

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
at the higher performance and there is

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.650 
at the higher performance and there is
no<00:02:33.830> legs<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:37.120> still<00:02:38.120> improve<00:02:38.930> your

recommend turn of it so another part of
the<00:03:30.079> game<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:32.329> server<00:03:33.340> speed<00:03:34.340> connection

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the game is the server speed connection

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.699 
the game is the server speed connection
so<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.510> great<00:03:38.930> internet

to get higher VPS on the online game and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.599 
to get higher VPS on the online game and
now<00:03:49.579> we<00:03:49.640> can<00:03:52.060> we<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.359> go<00:03:53.840> into<00:03:54.140> game<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.250> as

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
you can see the VPS is at high rates but

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.479 
you can see the VPS is at high rates but
the<00:04:01.730> quality<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.350> less<00:04:03.350> than<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:04.220> previous
