00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.029
 plump heavy let's face it 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.950
 pretty boy 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.200
 but who cares when you're the most 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.869
 cool so without further ado 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.189
 and mass dominator pro the most powerful 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.189
 gaming laptop 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.470
 the beginning of 2015 we all understand that 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.239
 bruised one laptop model can 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.489
 be a lot so let me explain to you 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.690
 why is this model itself 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.870
 powerful processor in it is a7 4710 which 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 can accelerate to three and a half 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:51.820
 gigahertz and these are four cores and 8 threads 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:57.310
 RAM ddr3 1600 megahertz 32 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.310
 gigabyte at home than rack 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.670
 although stop only 2 years ago 8 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 GB it was top-end system and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.900
 now it's pretty average 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.000
 so this laptop is charged on 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.820
 future bots all data storage 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.410
 consists of five hard drives four of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 which 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.630
 ssd drives are connected to an array of soup 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.260
 and three 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 a total capacity of 512 megabytes 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.530
 data warehouses 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090
 1 terabyte and of course the main one 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760
 feature that makes this 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.050
 laptop is not just the top and most powerful 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.840
 this is his nvidia gtx 980m graphics card at 8 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.450
 gigabyte built on 28 nanometer 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.600
 technology under the maxwell new architecture 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.240
 which replaced the kepler works 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.229
 same video card at 1038 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.259
 megahertz and memory gddr5 1200 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.750
 megahertz how are you here 17 3 inches and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.780
 It is built on the matrix tn + film that 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.450
 strange because again fashionable but the response 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.070
 this screen is smaller than that of a wasp and ip 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 it is more necessary 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.580
 consumer of this device 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.920
 keyboard and touchpad in dominator pro 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 installed from the top manufacturer 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.870
 game manipulators steelseries and in 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.450
 given me this manufacturer 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
 bit upset as the backlight in 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.570
 form of a rainbow 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.480
 turns a gaming laptop into itself 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.400
 there is a cheap Chinese toy 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 manual settings with which you 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.380
 You can choose a single color and disable 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.540
 blinking is more appropriate for this 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.610
 device class is present very 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.650
 interesting extra row of keys 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 the first of which switches modes 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.000
 keyboard backlight 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 Paradise same button launches the application 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.950
 expeed game caster which allows 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.080
 make a video capture and immediately 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.590
 upload videos on twitch and youtube 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.450
 3 same button turns your laptop here 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.450
 such a plane you just check it out 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.120
 This function is called cooler master 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.950
 which completely spins everything 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.960
 fans in the laptop once we already 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.190
 touched on this topic I want to praise 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.290
 cooling system 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 since the bottom cover has a lot 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.660
 holes and so the board is cooled 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.970
 we also see completely below 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.880
 subwoofer one audio and all 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.770
 audio system built on their technology 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.840
 what do synthetic tests tell us 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.220
 according to the manufacturer which 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.040
 appeared early fall 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.280
 This card was supposed to receive in 3d 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.930
 marks 9360 4 points 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.840
 from us she got even more than 9730 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.520
 but I understand that you are not interested 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.830
 synthetic tests you want to see 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.910
 on gaming performance therefore 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.910
 let's go on the spire 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.350
 such is said next home 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.139
 when 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.139
 but 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.040
 what do we see this laptop 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.860
 confirms his leadership skills in 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.960
 gaming world and many of the popular games 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.600
 go at maximum settings with 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.670
 almost maximum frame rate to him 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.700
 But this laptop will not be able to contend in 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.570
 design plan with the same asus rog or gave 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.000
 alengo 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.480
 but definitely they do in the plan 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.480
 performance 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.060
 but
