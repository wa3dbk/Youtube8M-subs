that I did I did not do a tutorial on
the<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.529> had<00:00:22.680> no<00:00:22.710> idea

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
the up to because I really had no idea

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.640 
the up to because I really had no idea
how<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.520> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.820> style<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.330> hair<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
how I was going to style my hair and to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.260 
how I was going to style my hair and to
be<00:00:25.770> honest<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.250> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.520> stumbled<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
be honest I kind of stumbled on the

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.720 
be honest I kind of stumbled on the
style<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.680> did<00:00:28.830> enough<00:00:29.070> request<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.699> will

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
style so if I did enough request I will

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.229 
style so if I did enough request I will
do<00:00:30.690> a<00:00:30.720> tutorial<00:00:31.020> on<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> how<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> did<00:00:32.460> but

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
do a tutorial on kind of how I did but

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.939 
do a tutorial on kind of how I did but
basically<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.780> left<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.350> piece<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
basically I left a piece out of the

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.330 
basically I left a piece out of the
front<00:00:35.129> for<00:00:35.400> bang<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:36.720> flat<00:00:37.379> twisted<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> bangs

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
front for bang I flat twisted the bangs

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.710 
front for bang I flat twisted the bangs
like<00:00:38.580> it's<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.559> my<00:00:40.559> distant<00:00:40.949> pattern<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:42.540> then

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
like it's a my distant pattern and then

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.079 
like it's a my distant pattern and then
I<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.470> tucked<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.159> intended<00:00:44.699> to

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
I just kind of tucked it intended to

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.630 
I just kind of tucked it intended to
kind<00:00:45.330> of<00:00:45.360> make<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.540> proof<00:00:45.839> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> front

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
kind of make a proof in the front

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.450 
kind of make a proof in the front
besides<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:48.059> flat<00:00:48.600> twisted<00:00:49.140> about<00:00:50.010> three<00:00:50.339> on

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
besides our flat twisted about three on

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.899 
besides our flat twisted about three on
each<00:00:50.670> side<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.680> then<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.799> top<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.339> all<00:00:53.580> two

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
each side and then the top is all two

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.880 
each side and then the top is all two
strand<00:00:54.269> twists<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.470> back<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:58.379> too

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
strand twists and the back is all too

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.380 
strand twists and the back is all too
strange<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> us<00:00:59.339> as<00:00:59.610> well<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.089> I<00:01:00.150> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
strange to us as well and I just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.740 
strange to us as well and I just
basically<00:01:00.949> pinned<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.369> the<00:01:02.909> very<00:01:03.150> very<00:01:03.239> top

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
basically pinned it in the very very top

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
basically pinned it in the very very top
so<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:04.290> pretty<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> choose<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so that's pretty much how I choose the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.770 
so that's pretty much how I choose the
style

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.010 

you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.100 

so<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.050> did<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.500> up<00:01:21.740> do<00:01:22.010> because<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:23.450> has<00:01:24.080> been

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
so I did this up do because it has been

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.000 
so I did this up do because it has been
really<00:01:24.560> really<00:01:24.830> hot<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:26.570> mean<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.410> just<00:01:27.800> let

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
really really hot and I mean to just let

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.590 
really really hot and I mean to just let
my<00:01:28.130> hair<00:01:28.340> relax<00:01:29.050> i'm<00:01:30.050> also<00:01:30.520> really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
my hair relax i'm also really

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.060 
my hair relax i'm also really
contemplating<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:32.930> cutting<00:01:33.380> out<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.830> rest

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
contemplating just cutting out the rest

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000 
contemplating just cutting out the rest
of<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.370> relaxer<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.120> my<00:01:35.240> hair<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:36.710> month

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
of the relaxer in my hair this month

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.290 
of the relaxer in my hair this month
makes<00:01:37.490> 18<00:01:37.910> months<00:01:39.250> transitioning<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.430> i

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
makes 18 months transitioning and i

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.120 
makes 18 months transitioning and i
think<00:01:41.540> i'm<00:01:41.660> just<00:01:41.690> at<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.110> point<00:01:42.320> where<00:01:42.620> i<00:01:42.650> need

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
think i'm just at the point where i need

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.280 
think i'm just at the point where i need
to<00:01:43.160> let<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.210> don't<00:01:44.510> really<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:44.900> I'm

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
to let it go I don't really think I'm

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.920

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
relax or cut out I'm look at the pointer

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.790 
relax or cut out I'm look at the pointer
because<00:02:08.240> she<00:02:08.510> said<00:02:08.750> she<00:02:08.780> has<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.350> straighten

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
because she said she has to straighten

because she said she has to straighten
it<00:02:10.040> in<00:02:10.280> order<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.360> give<00:02:11.600> me<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> good<00:02:12.020> even<00:02:12.440> cut

understand<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.350> won't

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.250 
understand that but I think that I won't
be<00:02:16.280> wearing<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.850> straight<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:17.780> during<00:02:18.050> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
be wearing it straight at all during the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.700 
be wearing it straight at all during the
summer<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.250> any<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:20.480> know<00:02:20.540> any<00:02:20.660> hair<00:02:21.500> that's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.490 
summer so any you know any hair that's
uneven<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.520> kind<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.120> feel<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:23.360> yes<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:24.380> get

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
