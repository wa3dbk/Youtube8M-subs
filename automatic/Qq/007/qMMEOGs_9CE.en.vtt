the<00:00:03.700> difference<00:00:04.240> in<00:00:04.390> lift<00:00:04.569> printing<00:00:05.040> compared

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
the difference in lift printing compared

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.509 
the difference in lift printing compared
to<00:00:06.130> black<00:00:06.340> and<00:00:06.520> white<00:00:06.700> is<00:00:07.090> primarily<00:00:07.750> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
to black and white is primarily the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.670 
to black and white is primarily the
effects<00:00:09.519> that<00:00:09.610> you<00:00:09.700> get<00:00:09.940> with<00:00:10.150> Tony<00:00:10.450> and<00:00:10.720> with

texture in the print the tones will

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.179 
texture in the print the tones will
range<00:00:15.490> anywhere<00:00:15.640> from<00:00:16.119> very<00:00:16.689> soft<00:00:17.320> warm<00:00:17.800> tones

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
range anywhere from very soft warm tones

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.270 
range anywhere from very soft warm tones
of<00:00:18.490> maybe<00:00:18.880> some<00:00:19.350> salmony<00:00:20.350> tones<00:00:20.619> all<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.130> way

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
of maybe some salmony tones all the way

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.250 
of maybe some salmony tones all the way
to<00:00:21.340> some<00:00:21.940> very<00:00:22.270> very<00:00:22.560> intense<00:00:23.610> hot<00:00:24.610> tones<00:00:24.910> in

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.960 
oranges and yellows and ochres and
things<00:00:28.119> like<00:00:28.270> that<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:29.550> workflow<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.760> very

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
things like that the workflow is very

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.819 
things like that the workflow is very
different<00:00:31.390> because<00:00:31.690> the<00:00:31.960> amount<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.559> time

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
different because the amount of time

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.740 
different because the amount of time
that<00:00:32.859> you<00:00:33.219> spend<00:00:33.699> in<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:33.940> enlarger<00:00:34.570> with

print about exposure you get the paper

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.110 
print about exposure you get the paper
basically<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:38.079> that<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:39.399> determines<00:00:39.940> what

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
basically is that that determines what

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.790 
basically is that that determines what
the<00:00:40.420> colors<00:00:40.960> that<00:00:41.199> you're<00:00:41.319> going<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.530> get<00:00:41.649> in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800

and this is when you have to really be

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.670 
and this is when you have to really be
paying<00:02:41.329> attention<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> whatever<00:02:41.989> marker<00:02:42.560> you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
to have come out in the tray before you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.160 
to have come out in the tray before you
snatch<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.639> and<00:02:49.909> again<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.480> snatch<00:02:50.989> it

snatch it out and again you snatch it
out<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.500> throw<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.799> immediately<00:02:52.040> into

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
out and you throw it immediately into

very closely at blacks

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.380 
very closely at blacks
there's<00:07:13.750> some<00:07:14.020> banding<00:07:14.470> in<00:07:14.590> the<00:07:14.680> blacks<00:07:15.390> you

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
there's some banding in the blacks you

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.600 
there's some banding in the blacks you
have<00:07:16.600> that<00:07:16.980> characteristic<00:07:17.980> of<00:07:18.310> a<00:07:18.400> paper

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
have that characteristic of a paper

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
negative and on the print itself we have

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.300 
negative and on the print itself we have
color<00:07:22.240> which<00:07:22.720> is<00:07:22.870> wonderful<00:07:23.170> and<00:07:23.800> you<00:07:23.860> can<00:07:24.070> see

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
color which is wonderful and you can see

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.730 
color which is wonderful and you can see
that<00:07:24.490> there<00:07:24.610> are<00:07:24.640> some<00:07:25.000> very<00:07:25.300> warm<00:07:26.230> tones<00:07:26.560> that

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
that there are some very warm tones that

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.080 
that there are some very warm tones that
are<00:07:26.830> coming<00:07:27.160> in<00:07:27.250> here<00:07:27.280> with<00:07:27.580> these<00:07:27.730> sort<00:07:28.030> of

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
are coming in here with these sort of

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.390 
are coming in here with these sort of
ochres<00:07:28.510> and<00:07:28.660> things<00:07:28.900> the<00:07:29.470> dry<00:07:29.740> down<00:07:30.010> will<00:07:30.250> give

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
ochres and things the dry down will give

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.580 
ochres and things the dry down will give
you<00:07:30.520> a<00:07:30.550> different<00:07:30.910> color<00:07:31.120> as<00:07:31.300> well<00:07:31.570> but<00:07:32.290> it's

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 
you a different color as well but it's

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.830 
you a different color as well but it's
an<00:07:32.740> interesting<00:07:33.190> effect<00:07:33.550> with<00:07:34.330> what<00:07:34.540> we<00:07:34.690> would

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 
an interesting effect with what we would

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.370 
an interesting effect with what we would
expect<00:07:35.170> to<00:07:35.290> have<00:07:35.560> as<00:07:36.150> as<00:07:37.150> a<00:07:37.210> clear<00:07:37.780> area<00:07:38.170> back

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380 
expect to have as as a clear area back

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.350 
expect to have as as a clear area back
here<00:07:38.410> that<00:07:38.860> would<00:07:38.980> get<00:07:39.130> color<00:07:39.400> we're<00:07:40.060> seeing

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
here that would get color we're seeing

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.780 
here that would get color we're seeing
where<00:07:40.960> the<00:07:41.170> light<00:07:41.830> from<00:07:41.980> the<00:07:42.130> enlarger<00:07:42.550> went

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.790 
where the light from the enlarger went

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:51.159 
where the light from the enlarger went
through

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:51.169 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.229
