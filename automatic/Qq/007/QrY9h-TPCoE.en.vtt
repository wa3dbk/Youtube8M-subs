00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.740
 Zhuang announced his debut in the national team 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 spain in 2002 and since then is 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
 her main protector with his 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.910
 direct help fury roha 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.590
 won Euro 2008 and World Cup 2010 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 now the footballer is on the left 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.850
 flank defense led the real ready 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.960
 share with you the subtleties of the selection of the ball 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.960
 in the subcategory 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 I will show how to pick the ball organized 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.310
 defense actions are important but more important 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:50.579
 winning the fight for the ball is best 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:52.620
 go to the tackle when the ball is on the lawn when 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 run alongside the attacking players not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 going down the sword's eye before rolling up need 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 be ahead of your opponent so do you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 there will be time to go to the tackle 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.609
 and knock the ball before the opponent takes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:16.799
 knock the ball aside 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:19.770
 so toed and heel and toe more comfortable 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.859
 give the sword the right direction to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.859
 then continue the game but go to the tackle 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.069
 heel is easier the main thing is to choose the right one 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.069
 moment 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.409
 when playing tackle you need to get to the ball 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.329
 earlier opponent otherwise you risk to break 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.960
 rules or even get yellow 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.780
 card 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 you must bear this in mind if you are not sure 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:55.969
 maybe you should choose another way 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.860
 stop the attacker after picking my 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.990
 the main task to start the attack 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.360
 need to find partners more profitable 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.789
 position and give him a simple pass to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.159
 he already controlled the sword further in 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.140
 theories on this is my task done but 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:20.180
 Of course you need to think about how to support 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:22.730
 further attack I showed you how 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.970
 play tackle further depends on 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.970
 you
