00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:14.570
 or we have it again some super the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.590
 tutorial because I call it super tutorial 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.830
 because it is super shocking 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.030
 at the same time the game is super easy to 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:32.060
 do 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:35.330
 you'll say good to me, let's see if we 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.600
 an experiment that shuffles you go to 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.760
 love for you 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 you're going to want for you the red deck 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.070
 Well, how can you see 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.070
 it's a completely normal deck 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 functions 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.940
 2 you are all 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 this is a deck 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.399
 of 22 all blue 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.530
 and also totally normal 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.530
 the stressors 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.040
 it's about trying to synchronize 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.920
 both exactly all 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.920
 movements you take now my deck 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 I make a small mixture 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.150
 you take yours 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.750
 I like mine started to see if 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 we try to do everything synchronized 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 we mix 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.250
 to make a cut more or less by the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.250
 half 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.720
 and now with the fast and upside down deck 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.979
 you need the return we take it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.390
 both on the back 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.140
 to the middle of a boiler 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.140
 and I also 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.230
 we take it out both of us face down we leave it 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:28.120
 lately now we always change 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.480
 for you and now face down we're going to catch 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.680
 and we introduce it in the middle of the package 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.540
 more or less in half 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.390
 to the middle positions of the package now 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.780
 we take the two decks face down from 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.780
 space 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.270
 Well, here we have your deck that you have 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.310
 chosen red myself because I've 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 chosen blue and we have 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.830
 exchanged a letter and we have done it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.830
 everything very synchronized we do not know 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.110
 even the letter that we have exchanged 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.550
 but we have exchanged letters for 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.230
 do the extension there has to be 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.330
 he had a blue letter of mine 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.450
 and I have to have the letter that you have 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.450
 dice 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.640
 only the letters that we have 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.890
 interchanged 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.860
 let's see the synchronized but 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.230
 we draw this letter the other 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:36.099
 letter 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:36.099
 we return them to 22 hearts 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:47.200
 it's awesome right 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 you can not walk by yourself further back 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.550
 to perform this game you must only 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.220
 previously separate two equal cards 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.800
 one of the blue plus one of the red mallet 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.180
 these two equal letters we put them 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.590
 in our back pocket remembering us 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.889
 of which is which I always placed the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.340
 blue letter on the red letter 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.280
 we leave them like this in the back pocket 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.529
 of the trousers we remember then of the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.079
 order 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:38.609
 now it's indifferent that the deck takes the 

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.219
 viewer 

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:42.800
 suppose the viewer chooses the 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.790
 red deck 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.830
 we stayed the blue deck 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.540
 now it is said that we synchronize the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.360
 movements that are made equally 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.990
 the mallet is mixed 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.230
 and that we take it to the back 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.580
 once the back we say that each one 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.630
 remove a card from the middle of the deck 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:12.449
 what we do is if we have 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:15.240
 to blue we take out the blue letter 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.650
 if we had the red mallet we would take the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.820
 Red letter 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:24.360
 pretending that we have taken it from 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.910
 half of our march eye with the 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.710
 angles and that no one is watching 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.290
 the back or sides 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.080
 now we can exchange the letters 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.700
 it will be placed by the spectator in the middle 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.640
 from his deck and he will give us any 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.910
 with this letter that also gives us the 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.780
 back what we do is deposit the 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.420
 in our pocket, take out our letter 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.510
 red back reminding us of the position 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:59.940
 and put it in the middle of our deck 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.940
 now the two decks are removed 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.810
 at the same time everything synchronized when making the 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.540
 extension 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:14.560
 of course a red letter will appear 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:19.570
 and when doing the extension of the red ones 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.540
 a blue will appear that obviously 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.470
 will be 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.470
 the same 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.730
 very simple but terribly effective 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.520
 nobody is going to want to count the letters of the 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.070
 mallet anyway 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.730
 anytime 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:45.350
 and we can take and add the letter that 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.350
 we have left in your pocket 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.600
 this is all 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.690
 easy and truly powerful I'll 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.690
 I assure
