moving much more from the concrete to
the<00:00:43.829> abstract<00:00:44.539> thinking<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.899> they've<00:00:46.050> been

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the abstract thinking so they've been

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
the abstract thinking so they've been
getting<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.850> than<00:00:48.030> what's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
getting to think about more than what's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.720 
getting to think about more than what's
just<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.289> front<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:50.070> they're

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
just right in front of them they're

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.770 
just right in front of them they're
children<00:00:51.210> who<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.780> great<00:00:52.110> intellect<00:00:52.699> an

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
children who have great intellect an

they still sometimes need to repeat an

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.110 
they still sometimes need to repeat an
activity<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
activity so that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.200 
activity so that
mastery<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.410> so<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.280> classroom<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.780> want<00:01:41.080> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mastery and so in a classroom we want to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.450 
mastery and so in a classroom we want to
help<00:01:43.210> them<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.800> stage<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.310> development

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
help them with the stage of development

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.060 
help them with the stage of development
but<00:01:46.150> spark<00:01:46.570> their<00:01:46.840> interests<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.620> that<00:01:47.770> they

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
but spark their interests so that they

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.400 
but spark their interests so that they
can<00:01:48.280> also<00:01:48.520> learn<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> work<00:01:49.870> here<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.320> our

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
can also learn so the work here in our

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.820 
can also learn so the work here in our
classroom<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:51.610> often<00:01:52.240> very<00:01:52.570> big<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.800> a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
classroom is often very big like a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
classroom is often very big like a
research

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
research

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.300 
research
maybe<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.540> we<00:01:56.290> started<00:01:56.770> talking<00:01:57.190> about

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
maybe it's we started talking about

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.700 
maybe it's we started talking about
planets<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.270> where<00:01:58.600> did<00:01:58.720> planets<00:01:59.170> come<00:01:59.440> from

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
planets and where did planets come from

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.730 
planets and where did planets come from
and<00:02:00.370> how<00:02:00.640> did<00:02:00.700> they<00:02:00.970> come<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.240> be<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.440> grows

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
and how did they come to be and it grows

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.640 
and how did they come to be and it grows
into<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.190> very<00:02:03.790> large<00:02:04.180> research<00:02:04.600> project<00:02:05.410> in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
into a very large research project in

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.160 
into a very large research project in
which<00:02:05.830> they<00:02:05.890> look<00:02:06.550> up<00:02:06.730> information<00:02:07.170> they

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
which they look up information they

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.520 
which they look up information they
write<00:02:08.470> information<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:10.090> do<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.300> project<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
write information they do a project and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.280 
write information they do a project and
that<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.790> something<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.300> serves<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that is something that serves the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.370 
that is something that serves the
elementary<00:02:14.950> intellect<00:02:15.780> some<00:02:16.780> work<00:02:17.020> we<00:02:17.230> do

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
elementary intellect some work we do

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.070 
elementary intellect some work we do
here<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.980> also<00:02:18.190> helps<00:02:18.760> their<00:02:19.240> physical

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
here that also helps their physical
