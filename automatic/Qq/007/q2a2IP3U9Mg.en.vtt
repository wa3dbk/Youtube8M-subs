00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello how about in this video we're going to do 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.660
 a speed test between these two 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.810
 equipment the samsung galaxy s 4 and the sony 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 xperia z 1 a very very new team has 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.390
 less than a month that was presented yet 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.890
 is not for sale in Mexico so 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.270
 official but we have it here and can 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 find it in the online store high 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.939
 mx dot range 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.950
 and well the two teams are off 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.260
 at this time and let's see which of 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.260
 the two makes the boot faster 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.339
 they both have wood animations 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.339
 basically similar 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.030
 it seems that the s4 is advancing 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:20.330
 for a couple of tenths of a second 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 wins the z1 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.020
 very well 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.010
 Well, in that sense, it was not very 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:38.720
 notorious the speed if you win the z1 but 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:42.720
 well, the s4 is not too far behind 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.320
 let's do a navigation test 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.710
 a second test 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.869
 speed 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.570
 let's navigate with chrome chrome what 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.640
 it comes preinstalled the z1 I have not 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.210
 reviewed completely but it seems that that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.159
 have a browser 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.760
 own then he delivery installed 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760
 chrome 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.090
 we are going to write 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.360
 the direction 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.360
 okay 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.610
 let's try to make them at the same 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.180
 time also 1 2 and 3 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.180
 buzz 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.900
 well there was almost immediate in the s4 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.900
 but 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.370
 the z1 is not too far behind 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.370
 well then 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.350
 these two tests are what we wanted 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.560
 make a comparison of the screens 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.520
 shows more content the screen of 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.970
 leds c4 for example in this it appears 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.300
 until this line of a black bomber the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 black cap and in this sample still a 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.319
 line below 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.900
 both are chrome you have to remember that and 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.519
 if the s4 like that shows more content 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.160
 on the same screen however that does not 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.290
 means that 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.450
 or a bad screen or something like that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.870
 they are simply configurations 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.040
 parameters that are and considers in your 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.100
 resolution 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.790
 well then 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.350
 this was a brief comparison between 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.770
 these two teams a team 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.520
 practically this month against a 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.400
 team of 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.600
 april may this year and already as 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.900
 six or seven months 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.140
 very well that's all we see in another 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.140
 video
