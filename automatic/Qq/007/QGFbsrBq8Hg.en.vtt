00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.430 
and my only complaint about them is that
I<00:03:13.910> find<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.120> lot<00:03:15.389> of<00:03:15.450> nike<00:03:15.900> boots<00:03:16.079> are

I find that a lot of nike boots are

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.910 
I find that a lot of nike boots are
really<00:03:16.470> tight<00:03:16.980> around<00:03:17.190> here<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:19.380> some<00:03:19.620> reason

really tight around here for some reason

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.979 
really tight around here for some reason
I<00:03:20.069> don't<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.400> how<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.730> stitched<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:23.780> laces<00:03:24.780> I

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
I don't like how it stitched and laces I

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.050 
I don't like how it stitched and laces I
don't<00:03:25.319> think<00:03:25.530> they're<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.739> strong<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.700> mean

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
don't think they're that strong I mean

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.240 
don't think they're that strong I mean
if<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.900> did<00:03:28.079> want<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.470> use<00:03:28.620> them<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:28.980> smell<00:03:29.220> I

if I did want to use them in the smell I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.500 
if I did want to use them in the smell I
don't<00:03:29.489> think<00:03:29.669> they<00:03:29.760> would<00:03:29.880> last<00:03:30.150> very<00:03:30.299> long

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
don't think they would last very long

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.170 
don't think they would last very long
with<00:03:30.900> after<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:32.280> salt<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.819> water<00:03:35.819> has

with after but salt and the water has
dried<00:03:36.419> up<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:37.290> pretty<00:03:37.709> sure<00:03:37.889> they're<00:03:38.130> gonna

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
dried up I'm pretty sure they're gonna

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.780 
dried up I'm pretty sure they're gonna
rip<00:03:38.489> easily<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.950> shoes<00:03:41.220> are<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.639> nice
