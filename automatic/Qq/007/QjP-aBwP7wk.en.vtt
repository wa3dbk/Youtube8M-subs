the problem is I should probably the
best-looking<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.200> here<00:00:19.880> into<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> light

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
best-looking one here into the light

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
best-looking one here into the light
here<00:00:21.450> is<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> upper<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> lower<00:00:22.590> they're

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
here is the upper and the lower they're

here is the upper and the lower they're
both<00:00:23.429> all<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:23.970> piece<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> pry<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
both all one piece so I got to pry that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.689 
both all one piece so I got to pry that
out<00:00:25.980> ah

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
out ah

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.999

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the back are completely gone but see my

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.390 
the back are completely gone but see my
cab<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:33.060> there<00:00:33.620> because<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.040> ones<00:00:35.220> look

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
cab I'm there because the new ones look

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.470 
cab I'm there because the new ones look
like<00:00:38.000> they<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.239> two-piece<00:00:41.480> polyurethane

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
like they are a two-piece polyurethane

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.590 
like they are a two-piece polyurethane
and<00:00:44.059> we're<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> put<00:00:45.570> some

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and we're just going to put some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
and we're just going to put some
silicone<00:00:46.079> grease<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.860> some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
silicone grease on there some

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.660 
silicone grease on there some
non-freezing<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.989> glide<00:00:49.199> in<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.710> but

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
non-freezing of them glide in there but

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.299 
non-freezing of them glide in there but
I'll<00:00:51.329> bring<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.690> when<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:51.960> close<00:00:52.309> all

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
I'll bring back when we're close all

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
I'll bring back when we're close all
right<00:00:53.460> got<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.829> not

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
right got this one now it's really not

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.950 
right got this one now it's really not
too<00:00:56.129> bad

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
too bad

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
too bad
this<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> uh<00:00:58.370> probably<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this one is uh probably one of the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.740 
this one is uh probably one of the
better<00:00:59.789> ones

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.770 

essentially<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:04.590> to<00:01:04.860> Peter<00:01:05.570> back<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> up

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
essentially that's to Peter back it up

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.800 
essentially that's to Peter back it up
with<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.050> focus<00:01:08.420> we're<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.690> try

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
with a little focus we're going to try

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.210 
with a little focus we're going to try
that<00:01:09.990> again<00:01:10.110> since<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> didn't<00:01:11.009> have<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that again since I didn't have the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190 
that again since I didn't have the
camera<00:01:11.450> where<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.570> supposed<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> be

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
camera where it's supposed to be

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.550 
camera where it's supposed to be
so<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.890> hole<00:01:14.100> attached<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> frame

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
so in this hole attached to the frame

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.340 
so in this hole attached to the frame
top<00:01:16.560> puck<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:21.350> bottom

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
top puck it's gonna go in there bottom

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
top puck it's gonna go in there bottom
piece<00:01:22.530> I've<00:01:23.040> already<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> collar<00:01:23.700> pushed

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
piece I've already got the collar pushed

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
piece I've already got the collar pushed
in<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:28.259> getting

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
in it's going to go in it's getting

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
in it's going to go in it's getting
coolant<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> plot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> almost<00:01:29.579> did<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
coolant for the plot of almost did it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.039 
coolant for the plot of almost did it
again<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.790> got<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> taper<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:35.159> then

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
again so it's got a taper down and then

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.370 
again so it's got a taper down and then

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
a good half inch of a little body lift I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.919 
a good half inch of a little body lift I
just<00:02:06.600> switched<00:02:06.780> into<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.140> bearings<00:02:08.929> it's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
just switched into these bearings it's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.350 
just switched into these bearings it's
not<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:11.040> really<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:12.060> bottom

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
not much because really the bottom

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
not much because really the bottom
pieces<00:02:12.660> don't<00:02:12.810> count

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
pieces don't count

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
pieces don't count
you<00:02:13.650> got<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> measure<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.340> bottom<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.720> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you got to measure the bottom this is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
you got to measure the bottom this is
what<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.140> body's<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.650> sitting<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
what your body's really sitting on this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
what your body's really sitting on this
is<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:17.940> more<00:02:18.900> suspension<00:02:19.470> piece<00:02:20.000> buffer<00:02:21.890> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
is just more suspension piece buffer so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.699 
is just more suspension piece buffer so
you<00:02:22.950> want<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> measure<00:02:23.280> those<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.030> still<00:02:24.959> this

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
you want to measure those but still this

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.880 
you want to measure those but still this
when<00:02:26.130> compressed<00:02:26.570> these<00:02:27.570> when<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> body<00:02:28.620> sits

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
when compressed these when the body sits

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
when compressed these when the body sits
on<00:02:29.070> them<00:02:29.250> they<00:02:29.400> squish<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> jelly

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
on them they squish out like a jelly

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.820 
on them they squish out like a jelly
