00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.039
 personal hello okay with you during the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 Last weekend I've been looking for 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.910
 on the internet something that could 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.489
 different from the channel and while 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 was walking the prison channel 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.820
 goalkeeper bosco 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.540
 I realized that she was doing a series of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.969
 This makes it top 5 years every Wednesday. 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.309
 the infantry description of her video 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:35.100
 I discovered that it was a thing of a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.840
 No fat group this and I do not remember the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.000
 name of the person who created but I will leave 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 down there letting the group down 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 also and I thought it would be fun 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.090
 make the theme of this week that would be the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 wednesday but I can not guess 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.630
 Wednesday is going out on the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 Saturday every Sunday 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.820
 I do not know around the theme of this week was 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 five books that were not theirs and I 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.989
 I confess it was a bit difficult to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.960
 me because almost every book that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 he is the avaÃ­ but I was able to separate one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.469
 a pile of books that I think is nice 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.899
 they are not to they are there in fifth place 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.630
 I place the war of the thrones of george 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.880
 rr martin that this one is for you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.329
 because the issue is in my 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.069
 parents 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.380
 I still have not been the fury of kings 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:22.409
 where the war of thrones and I think 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.840
 this book is not alias zones is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 simply fantastic is a kind of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 book you literally do not know 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.880
 where that story will go because it's 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.429
 very character is a lot 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.849
 happening and a lot and halliche 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.560
 happening people die like you 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.529
 think the character is going to die because 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.499
 and it 's very fantastic is the writing of 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:47.999
 george martin is incredible and today you 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.399
 are you asking yourself why I think 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.099
 incredible because I do not continue reading 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.369
 It's because laziness is not because you do not like it. 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:59.130
 I love it, but I 'll read it, I 'll go 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.359
 read on 4 of the I chose the books of the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.549
 genre and I read 20 light and marinas and 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:08.310
 travel without land and I prefer twenty thousand 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.780
 underwater leagues but I think 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
 any book by Jules Verne type 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 incredible is a book that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 past was 1800 and something that is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.140
 a very very cool thing 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.490
 see how the giverny creates his stuff 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.620
 his stories despite being 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.740
 old are nice to read you do not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.060
 is lost because it is something of another 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.250
 time is not very cool I love it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.410
 Old'm a big fan of him in third 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.080
 place this heart of korea ink 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.480
 funk and always has always had a good way 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.160
 to put this book in all tags and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.750
 everything I do because I am 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.090
 in love he is a while 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.130
 youth right is a little more adult 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.340
 in the third but even so the infant 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.320
 juvenile he is fantastic and fancy 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.490
 we have characters websites books and 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.750
 characters entry books and has a whole 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.120
 because behind it there is a whole 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.880
 story behind it and it's really cool. 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.880
 we have 100 notion because this book 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 is no longer spoken on the internet because he 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.030
 It's incredible, it's incredible, you should. 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.250
 reading is serious he is kind very much with is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.540
 definitely one of my favorites is 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.580
 forever 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 second is hell dan 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.170
 brown because this book is only lost to 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.560
 a book that you will find out why 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 why this book is like the book of 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.160
 mystery 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 If you like mystery and suspense if 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.570
 Do you like when your theories? 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.610
 are completely wrong which is what 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.410
 it happens here mine are they were 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.300
 completely wrong I started the book 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.769
 believe that this is a way and ended the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.880
 completely different game very 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.130
 best 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.799
 it gives both the twist in the story 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.080
 in you you start getting tico in 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.970
 my life was a lie and everything I 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.459
 it was a lie to me that I did not think 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.290
 strip is very good the dan brown he 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.019
 Can you make a fool of us? 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.610
 Well, at least I do not know, I think 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.860
 This is the feeling that I was feeling. 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.720
 feel I made a fool and I was happy with 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.000
 I think this is the only way 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.700
 there are people to be made and little and I found 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.010
 Hell was only overthrown by the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.890
 harry potter that despite many people 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.560
 finding faction juvenile child faction is a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.900
 handsome fan up to 100 after it starts to 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.270
 adult will also be getting 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.000
 Seriously, it's going to take more heavy things. 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.060
 things 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.280
 darkest dark but it gets 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
 as a juvenile child I think even 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.690
 during the harry trajectory 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.630
 This book was never a teenager. 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.820
 I can not get any of the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.940
 harry potter books like him then 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.830
 the first place harry always 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.990
 so this is it people video fast only 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.850
 to give you a helping hand even bring 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.070
 indicate it a little 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.470
 different for you if you want 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.110
 continue to do the themes of the group 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.970
 once in a while not to do 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.860
 all themes but if you want them to 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.110
 I went over there and brought a 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.450
 Touch it out for you, it's just you two talk 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.230

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.230
