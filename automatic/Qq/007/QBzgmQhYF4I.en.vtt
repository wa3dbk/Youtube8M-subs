00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
beautiful and I'm going to be so happy

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.330 
beautiful and I'm going to be so happy
because<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:17.630> was<00:05:18.630> really<00:05:18.930> out<00:05:19.169> of<00:05:19.320> tomatoes<00:05:20.100> so

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
because I was really out of tomatoes so

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.280 
because I was really out of tomatoes so
that'll<00:05:20.550> be<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.790> last<00:05:21.000> time<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:21.480> ever<00:05:21.720> do<00:05:22.020> that

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
that'll be the last time I ever do that

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.340 
that'll be the last time I ever do that
I'd<00:05:22.500> be<00:05:22.650> hydrated<00:05:23.340> everything<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.480> then<00:05:25.200> I

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
I'd be hydrated everything and then I

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.430 
I'd be hydrated everything and then I
powdered<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:27.020> wanted<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.110> clarify

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
powdered that I wanted to clarify

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.090 
powdered that I wanted to clarify
something<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.669> had<00:05:29.850> told<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.330> earlier<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:31.100> I

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
something I had told you earlier that I

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.260 
something I had told you earlier that I
had<00:05:33.110> dehydrated<00:05:34.110> on<00:05:34.290> my<00:05:34.530> tomatoes<00:05:35.270> that

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
had dehydrated on my tomatoes that

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.780 
had dehydrated on my tomatoes that
wasn't<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:36.840> bad<00:05:37.080> thing<00:05:37.640> dehydrating<00:05:38.640> my

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
wasn't a bad thing dehydrating my

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.230 
wasn't a bad thing dehydrating my
Tomatoes<00:05:39.360> wasn't<00:05:39.870> bad<00:05:40.169> but<00:05:41.070> what<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.310> did<00:05:41.669> was<00:05:42.000> I

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
Tomatoes wasn't bad but what I did was I

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.870 
Tomatoes wasn't bad but what I did was I
didn't<00:05:42.720> save<00:05:43.169> any<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.800> them<00:05:44.100> for<00:05:44.400> like<00:05:44.580> you

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
didn't save any of them for like you

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.640 
didn't save any of them for like you
know<00:05:45.030> pieces<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:47.300> powdered<00:05:48.300> everything<00:05:49.260> and

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
know pieces I powdered everything and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.860 
know pieces I powdered everything and
that's<00:05:50.370> not<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:52.260> good<00:05:53.160> idea<00:05:53.340> because<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.390> want<00:05:54.600> to

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
that's not a good idea because I want to

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.520 
that's not a good idea because I want to
sometimes<00:05:55.790> rehydrate<00:05:56.790> them<00:05:57.000> like<00:05:57.900> pieces

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
sometimes rehydrate them like pieces

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.340 
sometimes rehydrate them like pieces
like<00:05:58.770> this<00:05:59.070> or<00:05:59.400> even<00:05:59.640> break<00:05:59.880> them<00:06:00.120> up<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.690> be

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
like this or even break them up and be

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.750 
like this or even break them up and be
able<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.680> hear<00:06:02.070> hunks<00:06:02.910> in<00:06:03.090> food<00:06:03.810> too<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:04.770> I

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
able to hear hunks in food too so I

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.159 
able to hear hunks in food too so I
should<00:06:06.300> have

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
should have

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.459 
should have
that<00:06:07.349> but<00:06:07.590> I'd<00:06:07.710> be<00:06:07.860> hydrating<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.759> powders

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
that but I'd be hydrating and powders

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:14.029 
that but I'd be hydrating and powders
everything<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:12.180> with<00:06:12.449> their<00:06:12.689> this<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.620> what's

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
everything and with their this is what's

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.059 
everything and with their this is what's
left<00:06:14.219> over<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.960> we<00:06:16.229> don't<00:06:16.439> have<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.680> waste

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
left over and we don't have a waste

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.629 
left over and we don't have a waste

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.950 

I'm<00:06:46.220> going<00:06:46.400> to<00:06:46.460> turn<00:06:46.669> them<00:06:46.910> over<00:06:47.090> this<00:06:47.660> would

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
I'm going to turn them over this would

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.610 
I'm going to turn them over this would
be<00:06:48.080> sure<00:06:48.789> they<00:06:49.789> sound<00:06:50.150> pretty<00:06:50.419> dry<00:06:50.900> to<00:06:50.960> me<00:06:53.620> but

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.339 

the<00:07:22.620> end<00:07:22.830> product<00:07:23.629> then<00:07:24.629> I'll<00:07:24.810> put<00:07:25.080> them<00:07:25.169> in

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
the end product then I'll put them in

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.439

the jar more money left put in an
accident<00:07:31.139> absorber<00:07:32.479> and<00:07:34.069> we'll<00:07:35.069> be<00:07:35.250> done
