00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.900 
pretty I've renovated other boats and
this<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.040> gonna<00:01:29.190> bring<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
this one I'm gonna bring back really

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.890 
this one I'm gonna bring back really
nicely<00:01:34.550> looks<00:01:35.550> like<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.820> old<00:01:36.000> bee's<00:01:36.300> nest<00:01:36.600> up

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
nicely looks like an old bee's nest up

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.380 
nicely looks like an old bee's nest up
there

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:02:10.270 

and<00:01:45.390> these<00:01:45.510> windows<00:01:45.870> need<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.320> attention

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.820 

and<00:02:10.520> that's<00:02:10.789> just<00:02:11.000> screwed<00:02:11.330> down<00:02:11.830> exterior

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
and that's just screwed down exterior

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.720 
and that's just screwed down exterior
deck<00:02:13.040> screws<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> note<00:02:15.890> what<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> probably

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
deck screws as a note what I probably

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.570 
deck screws as a note what I probably
would<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.270> preferred<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:18.400> these<00:02:19.400> are<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
would have preferred to do these are the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
would have preferred to do these are the
ones<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> used<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.690> they're<00:02:21.650> holding

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
ones that I used and they're holding

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.580 
ones that I used and they're holding
fine<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:23.420> would<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:23.930> been<00:02:24.050> probably<00:02:24.230> better

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
fine it would have been probably better

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920 
fine it would have been probably better
to<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:25.250> ones<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.670> had<00:02:26.090> threads<00:02:26.510> all<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> way

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
to get ones that had threads all the way

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.620 
to get ones that had threads all the way
to<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.140> top<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.700> these<00:02:28.940> seem<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.300> be<00:02:29.420> biting

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to the top but these seem to be biting

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.910 
to the top but these seem to be biting
down<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:31.310> spaces<00:02:31.760> between<00:02:32.560> these<00:02:33.560> sheets

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
down and the spaces between these sheets

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.980 
down and the spaces between these sheets
is<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> big<00:02:34.580> deal<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:35.120> again<00:02:35.600> it's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
is not a big deal because again it's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.570 
is not a big deal because again it's
gonna<00:02:36.080> be<00:02:36.170> covered<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:36.709> indoor-outdoor

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
gonna be covered with indoor-outdoor

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.760 
gonna be covered with indoor-outdoor
carpeting<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:38.959> eventually<00:02:39.170> maybe<00:02:39.500> some

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
carpeting and then eventually maybe some

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.040 
carpeting and then eventually maybe some
cushions<00:02:40.510> something<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.600> keep<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:41.870> mind

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
cushions something to keep in mind

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.710 
cushions something to keep in mind
though<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> length<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> screws<00:02:43.720> I've

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
though is the length of the screws I've

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.229 
though is the length of the screws I've
got<00:02:44.900> plenty<00:02:45.110> clearance<00:02:45.739> here<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.030> haven't

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
got plenty clearance here so I haven't

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.760 
got plenty clearance here so I haven't
gone<00:02:47.420> through<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.720> whole<00:02:47.930> whole<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.590> boat

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
gone through the whole whole of the boat

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.240 
gone through the whole whole of the boat
but<00:02:49.780> even<00:02:50.780> shorter<00:02:51.200> ones<00:02:51.459> maybe<00:02:52.459> about<00:02:53.440> half<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
but even shorter ones maybe about half a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.120 
but even shorter ones maybe about half a
third<00:02:55.610> shorter<00:02:56.090> would<00:02:56.209> have<00:02:56.300> been<00:02:56.390> fine<00:02:57.070> but<00:02:58.070> I

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
third shorter would have been fine but I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.199 
third shorter would have been fine but I
had<00:02:58.310> these<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.640> hand<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.390> I<00:03:00.250> knew<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.520> got<00:03:01.910> them

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
had these on hand and I knew I got them

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.740
