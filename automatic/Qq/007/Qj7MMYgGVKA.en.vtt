00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.799
 let's see let's really tell if the 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.799
 normal cola 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.980
 it evaporates all the water and it becomes 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.980
 sugar 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.310
 I had to prove we'll see it and there I have 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.360
 zero coca-cola to try after 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.360
 they say that all 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 Perez in a while 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.250
 because there is all the sugar when it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 go to the water bowl look how disgusting 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.970
 in the milk cocacola a little look 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 against cast 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.440
 also look with roof 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.030
 look how disgusting all the sugar that has 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 stayed in the pan 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.440
 Now I'm going to throw the zero cola 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 ok is the thing with the zero indeed the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.470
 same amount 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.260
 is 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.360
 throw the same amount and let's see 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.550
 really that it evaporates all and that of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 truth does not have sugar the truth that 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 I prefer to drink if they do not have sugar or 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 at least it 's less bad looks like 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.900
 this is a lot of disgusting sugar 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.320
 that came out of the water with the normal and a 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320
 heap more 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.840
 let's see let's see 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.670
 well indeed zero coverage does not 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.830
 Contains sugar 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.189
 so that therefore it has to be 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.189
 best 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.120
 a little more healthy than that filthy one 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.400
 leaves you 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.960
 disgusting sugar minaz what is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.600
 there I think it's receipt of the previous 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.460
 but it's really going for another 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 Wow 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.920
 I prefer to take coca cola zero that is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.980
 by abnormal goodbye as paranormal chau 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.970
 I'm staying with this 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.069
 it was true the experiment did not consume 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.280
 better that crap full of sugar this 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.280
