00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.649 
able to create depth in the animation
was<00:01:49.500> done<00:01:49.860> better<00:01:50.100> than<00:01:50.369> any<00:01:50.640> 2d<00:01:51.149> film<00:01:51.450> I've

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
seen yet the colors were very vibrant

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
seen yet the colors were very vibrant
and<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.439> able<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> create

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and the way that he was able to create

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
and the way that he was able to create
both<00:01:56.369> foreground<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> background<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.079> have

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
like the focus right in between that was

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
like the focus right in between that was
beautiful<00:02:00.360> alright<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.140> first<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.409> let's<00:02:01.560> talk

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
beautiful alright so first up let's talk
about<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> characters<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.790> himself

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
about the characters do you know himself

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
about the characters do you know himself
I<00:02:03.540> thought<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.229> lovable<00:02:04.710> he<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
I thought was very lovable he is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.889 
I thought was very lovable he is
nearsighted<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.329> can't<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> pilot

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
nearsighted and so he can't be a pilot

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
nearsighted and so he can't be a pilot
but<00:02:07.079> he<00:02:07.290> loves<00:02:07.560> flying<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.160> he<00:02:08.250> decides<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
but he loves flying so he decides to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.330 
but he loves flying so he decides to
design<00:02:09.149> planes<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.259> liked<00:02:10.500> him<00:02:10.739> he<00:02:11.009> was

like this had like an indie feel and
that<00:02:17.570> there<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.900> something<00:02:18.110> unique<00:02:18.410> about

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
that there was something unique about

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180

no<00:02:22.490> idea<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.210> was<00:02:23.300> about<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.750> real<00:02:24.080> person

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
no idea that it was about a real person

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.260

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the baron i don't know there was just

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.000 
the baron i don't know there was just
something<00:02:54.410> about<00:02:54.440> his<00:02:54.650> presence<00:02:54.980> that

believe that planes are to them and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.070 
believe that planes are to them and

the interaction with this guy so that

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.420 
the interaction with this guy so that
was<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.020> was<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.320> nice<00:03:42.620> part<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.190> film

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
was that was a nice part of the film

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.180 
was that was a nice part of the film
however<00:03:43.640> they<00:03:44.090> were<00:03:44.150> few<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.840> far<00:03:45.110> between

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
however they were few and far between

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.430 
however they were few and far between
those<00:03:46.190> sequences<00:03:46.989> most<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.260> was<00:03:48.410> spent

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
those sequences most of it was spent

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400 
those sequences most of it was spent
about<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.489> aging<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.720> journey<00:03:51.140> of

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
about this this aging the the journey of

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.920 
about this this aging the the journey of
of<00:03:51.680> Jiro<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.670> felt<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.330> passage<00:03:53.780> of

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
of Jiro and I felt like the passage of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.350 
of Jiro and I felt like the passage of
time<00:03:53.989> was<00:03:54.530> very<00:03:54.890> unclear<00:03:55.610> as<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.880> Western

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.560 
were times that I zoned out and I had to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
you'll be able to follow it but it was

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.490 
you'll be able to follow it but it was
one<00:04:11.450> of<00:04:11.480> those<00:04:11.630> things<00:04:11.840> where<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.050> knew<00:04:12.290> like

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
one of those things where I knew like

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.750 
one of those things where I knew like
especially<00:04:12.920> if<00:04:13.010> I'm<00:04:13.100> gonna<00:04:13.220> sit<00:04:13.430> down<00:04:13.550> here

especially if I'm gonna sit down here

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.520 
especially if I'm gonna sit down here
and<00:04:13.880> talk<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.300> guys<00:04:14.450> about<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.080> want<00:04:15.350> to

and talk to you guys about it I want to
be<00:04:15.620> able<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.830> articulate<00:04:16.340> why<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:16.820> didn't<00:04:17.540> like

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
be able to articulate why I didn't like

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.570 
be able to articulate why I didn't like
it<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.019> think<00:04:18.260> Ross<00:04:18.950> brings<00:04:19.190> up<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.340> really<00:04:19.430> good

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
it I think Ross brings up a really good

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.039 
it I think Ross brings up a really good
point<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.150> Western<00:04:20.480> audiences<00:04:20.900> are

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
point and that Western audiences are

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.450 
point and that Western audiences are
gonna<00:04:21.169> lose<00:04:21.410> out<00:04:21.590> on<00:04:21.620> some<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.280> things

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
gonna lose out on some of the things

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.860 
gonna lose out on some of the things
that<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.640> think<00:04:22.760> Miyazaki<00:04:23.300> was<00:04:23.419> really<00:04:23.690> trying

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
that I think Miyazaki was really trying

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.540 
that I think Miyazaki was really trying
to<00:04:23.960> convey<00:04:24.260> with

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to convey with

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
also that there was a tuberculosis

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.580 
also that there was a tuberculosis
outbreak<00:04:45.909> that<00:04:46.389> devastated<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.050> lot<00:04:47.199> of<00:04:47.289> Japan

outbreak that devastated a lot of Japan

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.290 
outbreak that devastated a lot of Japan
that's<00:04:47.889> talked<00:04:48.190> about<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.669> film<00:04:48.879> but<00:04:49.120> it's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
that's talked about in the film but it's

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.430 
that's talked about in the film but it's
not<00:04:49.509> a<00:04:50.229> huge<00:04:50.800> portion<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.460> our<00:04:52.440> understanding

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
not a huge portion of our understanding

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.379 
not a huge portion of our understanding
of<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.830> time<00:04:54.129> it's<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:54.520> kind<00:04:54.819> of<00:04:54.849> we<00:04:55.030> feel

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
of that time it's just kind of we feel

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.850 
of that time it's just kind of we feel
it's<00:04:55.599> like<00:04:55.720> an<00:04:55.840> unfortunate<00:04:56.349> event<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.680> fact

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
it's like an unfortunate event in fact

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
it's like an unfortunate event in fact
when<00:04:57.069> I<00:04:57.099> was<00:04:57.250> looking<00:04:57.580> over<00:04:58.210> notes<00:04:58.479> for<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:58.780> I

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
when I was looking over notes for this I

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.170 
when I was looking over notes for this I
had<00:04:59.469> no<00:04:59.680> idea<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.430> was<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.699> widespread

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
had no idea that it was that widespread

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.260 
had no idea that it was that widespread
so<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.440> mean<00:05:02.889> even<00:05:02.979> somebody<00:05:03.490> who's<00:05:03.759> fairly

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
so I mean even somebody who's fairly

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.820 
so I mean even somebody who's fairly
familiar<00:05:04.419> with<00:05:04.659> Japanese<00:05:05.080> history<00:05:05.319> it<00:05:05.560> wasn't

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
familiar with Japanese history it wasn't

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.409 
familiar with Japanese history it wasn't
something<00:05:05.949> that<00:05:06.099> spoke<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.430> me<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.759> on<00:05:07.090> top<00:05:07.300> of

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
something that spoke to me and on top of

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.330 
something that spoke to me and on top of
that<00:05:07.539> how<00:05:07.840> they<00:05:08.020> viewed<00:05:08.319> their<00:05:08.800> economic

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that how they viewed their economic

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.189 
that how they viewed their economic
times<00:05:09.580> before<00:05:09.969> World<00:05:10.180> War<00:05:10.300> two<00:05:10.509> is<00:05:10.719> another

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
times before World War two is another

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.510 
times before World War two is another
big<00:05:11.469> theme<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.860> they're<00:05:12.009> trying<00:05:12.159> touching

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
big theme that they're trying touching

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.070 
big theme that they're trying touching
in<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.669> film<00:05:12.849> how<00:05:13.030> they<00:05:13.150> feel<00:05:13.330> behind<00:05:13.509> other

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
in the film how they feel behind other

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.629 
in the film how they feel behind other
countries<00:05:14.590> that's<00:05:15.069> just<00:05:15.280> something<00:05:15.520> as<00:05:15.610> a

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
and what there is and I definitely found

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.340 
and what there is and I definitely found
that<00:06:39.670> I<00:06:39.760> learned<00:06:40.060> a<00:06:40.210> lot<00:06:40.390> from<00:06:40.450> watching<00:06:40.960> it

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
that I learned a lot from watching it

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.750 
that I learned a lot from watching it
however<00:06:41.650> the<00:06:41.860> experience<00:06:42.340> was<00:06:42.610> not<00:06:42.730> a

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
however the experience was not a

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.430 
however the experience was not a
pleasant<00:06:42.970> one<00:06:43.270> and<00:06:43.510> I<00:06:43.870> think<00:06:43.930> that<00:06:44.200> there<00:06:44.350> are

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
pleasant one and I think that there are

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.020 
pleasant one and I think that there are
both<00:06:44.650> sides<00:06:44.710> to<00:06:45.190> that<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:45.580> need<00:06:45.760> to<00:06:45.880> be

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
both sides to that that need to be

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.820 
both sides to that that need to be
shared<00:06:46.540> with<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:46.690> guys<00:06:46.810> know<00:06:47.350> definitely<00:06:47.800> I

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
shared with you guys know definitely I

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.170 
shared with you guys know definitely I
think<00:06:47.890> it's<00:06:48.160> really<00:06:48.310> valid<00:06:48.760> because<00:06:48.880> there

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
think it's really valid because there

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.550 
think it's really valid because there
are<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.330> lot<00:06:49.390> of<00:06:49.540> people<00:06:49.750> who<00:06:49.840> aren't<00:06:50.020> like<00:06:50.170> huge
