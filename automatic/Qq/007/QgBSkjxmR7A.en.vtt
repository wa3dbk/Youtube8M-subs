small screwdriver and remove that so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.340 
small screwdriver and remove that so
we'll<00:01:13.969> set<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.240> aside<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.020> now<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.229> have

and slide it back in make sure it's in
there<00:02:50.060> securely<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.380> yours<00:02:51.590> may<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:52.070> slide

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
there securely and yours may just slide

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.280 
there securely and yours may just slide
in<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.820> kind<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.240> lock<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.750> may<00:02:53.840> have<00:02:54.050> some

screws this has a HP calls it the
protect<00:02:59.630> smart<00:03:00.050> systems<00:03:00.920> that's<00:03:01.370> why<00:03:01.490> we<00:03:01.610> have

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
protect smart systems that's why we have

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.150 
protect smart systems that's why we have
these<00:03:01.910> bumpers<00:03:02.420> here<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:03.530> provide<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> little

these bumpers here that provide a little
bit<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.370> extra<00:03:04.490> protection<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:07.520> after<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.390> get

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
bit of extra protection and after we get

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.980 
bit of extra protection and after we get

with no books com we just got the Intel

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.280 
with no books com we just got the Intel

SSD installed and so we're going to boot
the<00:04:05.410> computer<00:04:05.440> up<00:04:05.890> here<00:04:06.100> just<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> show

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the computer up here just going to show

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.300 
the computer up here just going to show
you<00:04:07.180> how<00:04:07.330> fast<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.750> get<00:04:07.900> into<00:04:08.170> Windows<00:04:10.770> now<00:04:11.770> I

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
you how fast we get into Windows now I

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.970 
you how fast we get into Windows now I
didn't<00:04:13.000> time<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.270> beforehand<00:04:14.140> with<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.860> old

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
didn't time it beforehand with the old

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.690 
didn't time it beforehand with the old
hard<00:04:15.220> drive<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.180> you'll<00:04:17.079> notice<00:04:17.440> here<00:04:17.980> once

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
hard drive but you'll notice here once

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.650 
hard drive but you'll notice here once
we<00:04:18.850> get<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.410> we're<00:04:20.410> at<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.530> HP<00:04:20.709> screen<00:04:21.340> and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
we get going we're at the HP screen and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.940 
we get going we're at the HP screen and
I<00:04:22.660> think<00:04:22.840> from<00:04:22.960> here<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:23.320> about<00:04:23.410> maybe<00:04:23.680> five

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
I think from here it's about maybe five

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.030 
I think from here it's about maybe five
seconds<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.940> learn<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.210> windows<00:04:25.950> maybe<00:04:26.950> a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
seconds to learn the windows maybe a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:36.310 
seconds to learn the windows maybe a
little<00:04:27.220> bit<00:04:27.400> longer<00:04:31.380> starting<00:04:32.380> up

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.530 

looks<00:04:36.920> like<00:04:37.070> we're<00:04:37.250> about<00:04:37.340> 10<00:04:37.970> seconds<00:04:38.390> now

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
looks like we're about 10 seconds now

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.399 
looks like we're about 10 seconds now
welcome<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.690> Windows

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.029 

felt<00:04:47.099> faster<00:04:47.459> the<00:04:47.550> first<00:04:47.759> time<00:04:47.939> I<00:04:47.969> guess<00:04:49.039> but

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
felt faster the first time I guess but

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.999 
felt faster the first time I guess but
as<00:04:50.459> you<00:04:50.639> can<00:04:50.729> tell<00:04:51.019> took<00:04:52.019> about<00:04:52.169> maybe<00:04:52.469> 10-15

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
as you can tell took about maybe 10-15

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.629 
as you can tell took about maybe 10-15
seconds<00:04:53.339> till<00:04:53.489> we're<00:04:53.610> into<00:04:53.789> windows<00:04:54.149> and

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
seconds till we're into windows and

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.070 
seconds till we're into windows and
we'll<00:04:56.639> launch<00:04:56.909> something<00:04:57.389> here<00:04:57.659> we<00:04:57.779> got<00:04:57.929> some

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
we'll launch something here we got some

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.369 
we'll launch something here we got some

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
just fine let's open something a little

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:15.550 
just fine let's open something a little
more<00:05:06.509> taxing<00:05:07.909> Vegas<00:05:08.909> movie<00:05:09.119> studio

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.129 

and<00:05:16.100> that's<00:05:16.250> going<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.430> go<00:05:16.580> up<00:05:16.700> on<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.139> second

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
and that's going to go up on the second

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.730 
and that's going to go up on the second
monitor<00:05:18.410> over<00:05:18.740> here<00:05:20.560> kind<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.590> go<00:05:21.680> through

now<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:34.310> show<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.940> speed<00:05:35.330> but<00:05:36.200> we'll<00:05:36.530> be

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
now to show you the speed but we'll be

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.290 
now to show you the speed but we'll be
doing<00:05:37.160> some<00:05:37.340> testing<00:05:37.639> moving<00:05:37.940> some<00:05:38.090> files

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
doing some testing moving some files

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.500 
doing some testing moving some files
around<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:39.580> just<00:05:40.580> kind<00:05:40.760> of<00:05:40.790> seeing<00:05:41.060> overall

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
around and just kind of seeing overall

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.390 
around and just kind of seeing overall
performance<00:05:41.840> wise<00:05:42.169> so<00:05:42.590> far<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.250> past

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.510 
performance wise so far in the past
about<00:05:43.660> 10-15<00:05:44.660> minutes<00:05:44.870> using<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.440> seems<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
about 10-15 minutes using it it seems to

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.150 
about 10-15 minutes using it it seems to
be<00:05:46.550> noticeably<00:05:47.120> faster<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.660> me<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:48.010> just<00:05:49.010> kind

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
be noticeably faster to me and just kind

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.770 
be noticeably faster to me and just kind

so the hard drive we have inside is only

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.050 
so the hard drive we have inside is only
80<00:06:05.900> but<00:06:06.440> we<00:06:06.470> have<00:06:06.620> 128<00:06:07.250> gig<00:06:07.550> here<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:07.970> these

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
80 but we have 128 gig here and these

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.469 
80 but we have 128 gig here and these
come<00:06:08.300> up<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.380> 256<00:06:10.250> gigabyte<00:06:10.700> slide<00:06:11.180> right<00:06:11.360> in
