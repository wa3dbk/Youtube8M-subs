00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
different variations of RS different

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
different variations of RS different
variations<00:01:46.980> and<00:01:47.100> hips<00:01:47.340> upper<00:01:47.640> body<00:01:47.850> blah<00:01:48.150> blah

and<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.200> you're<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.800> maybe<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.370> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and now you're kind of maybe you want to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
and now you're kind of maybe you want to
be<00:01:50.880> able<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.180> put<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.360> together<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.050> we're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
be able to put it together so we're

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.800 
be able to put it together so we're
talking<00:01:52.440> about<00:01:52.580> combinations<00:01:53.580> that<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
talking about combinations that is the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.300 
talking about combinations that is the
specific<00:01:55.050> one<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> should<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.770> able<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> use

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
specific one you should be able to use

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.250 
specific one you should be able to use
you<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.300> trying<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.900> how<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.110> can

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
you are trying to see how you can

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.710 
you are trying to see how you can
combine<00:01:58.470> different<00:01:58.800> amuse<00:01:59.330> that<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.479> learned

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
combine different amuse that you learned

combine different amuse that you learned
that<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.290> basic<00:02:01.440> technique<00:02:02.130> moves<00:02:02.540> and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that a really basic technique moves and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.530 
that a really basic technique moves and
put<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.140> together<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.220> combo<00:02:05.700> count<00:02:06.180> or

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
put it together in an a combo count or

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
put it together in an a combo count or
in<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.260> counter<00:02:07.799> six<00:02:08.069> count<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:08.459> seven

be something like I don't know it could

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.380 
be something like I don't know it could
be<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.159> choreography<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.819> want<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.120> able<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
well then start first of all by learning

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.229 
well then start first of all by learning
other<00:02:40.439> people's<00:02:40.829> choreographies<00:02:41.430> which<00:02:42.030> will

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
other people's choreographies which will

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.759 
other people's choreographies which will
give<00:02:42.359> you<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> good<00:02:42.540> sense<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.019> how<00:02:43.200> simple

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
give you a good sense of how simple

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.199 
give you a good sense of how simple
moves<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.129> put<00:02:44.340> together<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:44.939> music

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
moves are put together with the music

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.839 
moves are put together with the music
and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.650> there<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:46.859> go<00:02:47.099> okay<00:02:47.790> so

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
and then from there you go okay so

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.339 
and then from there you go okay so
that's<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.389> dead<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.230> maybe

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
that's how it's dead and then maybe

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.390 
that's how it's dead and then maybe
you'll<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.590> created<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.159> your<00:02:50.280> own

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you'll be created with your own

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.390 
you'll be created with your own
choreography<00:02:51.030> after<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.420> improv<00:02:52.260> improv<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
choreography after that improv improv is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.879 
choreography after that improv improv is
the<00:02:53.609> hardest<00:02:53.879> thing<00:02:54.030> yes<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.900> admit<00:02:55.109> that<00:02:55.470> there

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
the hardest thing yes I admit that there

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.619 
the hardest thing yes I admit that there
is<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> trick<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.299> learn<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
is a trick to it you have to learn the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.110 
is a trick to it you have to learn the
rhythms<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.530> music<00:02:58.980> eerie<00:02:59.250> music<00:02:59.549> what's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
rhythms of the music eerie music what's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.030 
rhythms of the music eerie music what's
your<00:03:00.180> own<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.510> rhythms<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.870> Arabic<00:03:01.319> music<00:03:01.470> you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
your own the rhythms of Arabic music you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.699 
your own the rhythms of Arabic music you
can<00:03:02.189> anticipate<00:03:02.519> how<00:03:03.150> rhythm<00:03:04.109> is<00:03:04.319> going<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
can anticipate how rhythm is going to

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
can anticipate how rhythm is going to
end<00:03:04.920> once<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.459> have<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.639> big<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> usually

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
end once you have a big in of it usually

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.410 
end once you have a big in of it usually
usually<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> time<00:03:08.549> but<00:03:08.879> you<00:03:09.209> can

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
usually not all the time but you can

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.690 
usually not all the time but you can
sometimes<00:03:10.109> Arabs<00:03:10.769> are<00:03:10.889> very<00:03:11.250> good<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.519> that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
sometimes Arabs are very good at that

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.030 
sometimes Arabs are very good at that
because<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:13.049> know<00:03:13.079> just<00:03:13.439> grow<00:03:13.650> up<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.889> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
because you know just grow up with that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.339 
because you know just grow up with that
stuff<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.879> know<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.150> very<00:03:15.299> well<00:03:15.389> but<00:03:16.230> if

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
stuff so we know it very well but if

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.899 
stuff so we know it very well but if
you're<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.590> Arab<00:03:17.010> you're<00:03:17.159> not<00:03:17.280> familiar<00:03:17.400> it's

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
you're not Arab you're not familiar it's

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.909 
you're not Arab you're not familiar it's
hard<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:18.629> hard<00:03:18.870> for<00:03:19.049> me<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.379> an<00:03:19.500> Arab<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
hard it's very hard for me as an Arab to

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.580 
hard it's very hard for me as an Arab to
teach<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.699> other<00:03:21.150> non<00:03:21.449> Arabs<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
teach that to other non Arabs so I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.520 
teach that to other non Arabs so I
absolutely<00:03:23.489> understand<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:25.379> got<00:03:25.500> to
