make<00:00:34.559> sense<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:35.190> sure<00:00:35.430> it'll<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.790> off

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
make sense I'm sure it'll be way off

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.700 
make sense I'm sure it'll be way off
when<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> car<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:36.989> hopefully

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when I get it in the car but hopefully

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
when I get it in the car but hopefully
it'll<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> fired<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> wire<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it'll get it fired up if I wire it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.520 
it'll get it fired up if I wire it
correctly<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:42.390> makes<00:00:42.570> sense<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.140> timing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
correctly it makes sense you know timing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.029 
correctly it makes sense you know timing
gets<00:00:43.649> pulled<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> boost<00:00:44.250> goes<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
gets pulled on the boost goes up and

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.520 
gets pulled on the boost goes up and
timing<00:00:47.039> advances<00:00:47.809> properly<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.200> other<00:00:49.320> words

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
timing advances properly in other words

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.900 
timing advances properly in other words
all<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.649> gauges<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.219> responding<00:00:50.700> properly

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
all the gauges are responding properly

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
all the gauges are responding properly
to<00:00:51.149> all<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> inputs<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> stim<00:00:52.500> board<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
to all the inputs from the stim board so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.959 
to all the inputs from the stim board so
that's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.760> good<00:00:53.850> sign<00:00:54.590> let<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.710> cut<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.699> short

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's a good sign let me cut this short

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
that's a good sign let me cut this short
and<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> put<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.109> mega<00:00:58.800> view<00:00:59.039> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and I'm going to put the mega view in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I'm going to put the mega view in
here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> show<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.170> works<00:01:02.480> alright

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
here and show you how that works alright

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
here and show you how that works alright
well<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.719> I've<00:01:03.809> done<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.199> I've<00:01:04.379> taken<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
well what I've done is I've taken the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.210 
well what I've done is I've taken the
data<00:01:05.220> cable<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.299> comes<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.439> ms2<00:01:07.979> box

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.149 
push select again and move to the next
value<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.680> basically

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
value so there you go this is basically

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.529 
value so there you go this is basically
going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.430> mounted<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.920> car<00:02:08.539> probably

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
going to be mounted in the car probably

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
going to be mounted in the car probably
where<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> radio<00:02:10.050> goes

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
where the radio goes

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.030 
where the radio goes
I'm<00:02:11.989> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> take<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.530> radio<00:02:12.739> out<00:02:12.859> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I'm going to take the radio out and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.729 
I'm going to take the radio out and
we'll<00:02:13.129> really<00:02:13.280> need<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.579> anymore<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.659> I'm<00:02:15.620> out

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
we'll really need it anymore and I'm out

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.199 
we'll really need it anymore and I'm out
this<00:02:15.890> behind<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.159> piece<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> lexan<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:16.969> that<00:02:17.120> you

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
this behind a piece of lexan so that you

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.339 
this behind a piece of lexan so that you
can<00:02:17.329> only<00:02:17.390> see<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.659> letters<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.049> won't<00:02:18.200> see

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
can only see the letters you won't see

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.640 
can only see the letters you won't see
the<00:02:18.500> actual<00:02:18.859> board<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.930> tinted<00:02:21.319> lexan

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the actual board or tinted lexan

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
the actual board or tinted lexan
actually<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.189> this<00:02:22.519> will<00:02:22.879> mount<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
actually in this this will mount in the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.270 
actually in this this will mount in the
tinted<00:02:23.930> lex<00:02:24.109> and<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.379> well<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.890> you'll<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.159> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
tinted lex and as well so you'll see the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.550 
tinted lex and as well so you'll see the
four<00:02:25.430> buttons<00:02:25.730> below<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:27.049> also<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.530> a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
four buttons below that they also have a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.910 
four buttons below that they also have a
button<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.310> an<00:02:29.180> LED<00:02:29.569> in<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.319> panel<00:02:30.650> that's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
button and an LED in the panel that's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.610 
button and an LED in the panel that's
going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.609> calibration<00:02:32.060> button<00:02:32.299> for<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
going to be a calibration button for the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890 
going to be a calibration button for the
wideband<00:02:33.620> o2<00:02:33.769> sensor<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.549> system<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
wideband o2 sensor for the system so it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.879 
wideband o2 sensor for the system so it
should<00:02:36.049> be<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.170> pretty<00:02:36.230> clean<00:02:36.560> install

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
should be a pretty clean install

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.490 
should be a pretty clean install
hopefully<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.340> works<00:02:38.079> how<00:02:39.079> it's<00:02:39.230> supposed

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
hopefully it all works how it's supposed

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.920 
hopefully it all works how it's supposed
to<00:02:40.719> all<00:02:41.719> right<00:02:42.250> i'll<00:02:43.450> do<00:02:44.450> some<00:02:44.480> more<00:02:44.689> video

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
to all right i'll do some more video

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.980 
to all right i'll do some more video
taping<00:02:45.230> when<00:02:45.349> i<00:02:45.379> get<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.799> car
