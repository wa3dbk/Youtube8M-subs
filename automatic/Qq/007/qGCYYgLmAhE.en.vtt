00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.410 

now<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> start<00:00:25.859> off<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> want

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
now to start off with what what I want

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
now to start off with what what I want
to<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.900> choose<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.340> simple

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to do is to choose a very very simple

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.440 
to do is to choose a very very simple
technique<00:00:30.260> which<00:00:31.260> will<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> few<00:00:31.650> seconds

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
technique which will take a few seconds

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.910 
technique which will take a few seconds
to<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.960> double<00:00:34.260> click<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to do that just double click on the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.780 
to do that just double click on the
image<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> layer<00:00:36.870> style

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
image and you get the layer style

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
image and you get the layer style
effects<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.809> down<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> stroke<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
effects and go down to stroke which is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
effects and go down to stroke which is
at<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> bottom<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.700> choose<00:00:42.480> whatever<00:00:42.780> color

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
at the bottom and choose whatever color

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.810 
at the bottom and choose whatever color
you<00:00:43.350> want

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
you want

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.240 
you want
select<00:00:44.820> inside<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.440> position<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.129> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
select inside as the position and then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.540 
select inside as the position and then
just<00:00:47.280> slide<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.450> size<00:00:48.690> meter<00:00:49.530> until<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.399> get

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
just slide the size meter until you get

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
just slide the size meter until you get
the<00:00:50.640> border<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:52.129> this<00:00:53.129> technique

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the border that you want this technique

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.439 
the border that you want this technique
is<00:00:53.850> reversible<00:00:55.129> non-destructive<00:00:56.449> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
is reversible non-destructive just

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869 
is reversible non-destructive just
switch<00:00:57.930> off<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> stroke<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.039> turn<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> off<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
switch off the stroke to turn it off and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
switch off the stroke to turn it off and
all<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> techniques<00:01:00.989> shown<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.379> will<00:01:01.500> be

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
all the techniques shown here will be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.929 
all the techniques shown here will be
non-destructive<00:01:03.379> now<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.949> second<00:01:05.610> technique

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
non-destructive now the second technique

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
non-destructive now the second technique
involves<00:01:06.810> using<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> square<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.340> rectangle

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
involves using the square or rectangle

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.590 
involves using the square or rectangle
select<00:01:09.450> tool<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> selection<00:01:11.600> then

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
select tool just make a selection then

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.969 
select tool just make a selection then
go<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> mask<00:01:14.900> button<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> create<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
go down to the mask button and create a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.300 
go down to the mask button and create a
new<00:01:17.159> mask<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.259> create<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
new mask and that will create a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
new mask and that will create a
transparent<00:01:21.030> area<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> edges<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
transparent area at the edges of the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.310 
transparent area at the edges of the
mask<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> create<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> new<00:01:24.060> layer

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
mask and now if you create a new layer

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.490 
mask and now if you create a new layer
bring<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> bottom<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.500> fill

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
bring that down to the bottom and fill

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
bring that down to the bottom and fill
that<00:01:28.680> layer<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:28.979> whatever<00:01:29.460> color<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.060> want

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.679 

and<00:01:32.999> that<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:34.109> be<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.649> new<00:01:35.039> border<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and that will be your new border now you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.419 
and that will be your new border now you
can<00:01:36.810> use<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> technique<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.710> create<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:38.219> rate

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
can use this technique to create a rate

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.630 
can use this technique to create a rate
to<00:01:39.030> create<00:01:39.270> irregular<00:01:39.810> borders<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.490> can

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to create irregular borders but you can

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
to create irregular borders but you can
do<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.030> than<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.359> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
do even more than that if you go to the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
do even more than that if you go to the
masks<00:01:44.539> -<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.630> masks<00:01:46.020> menu<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.299> change

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
masks - the masks menu you can change

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.550 
masks - the masks menu you can change
the<00:01:49.079> feather<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.929> will<00:01:52.049> allow<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.349> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the feather and that will allow you to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
the feather and that will allow you to
create<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.069> sort<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> traditional<00:01:54.060> looking

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
create a sort of a traditional looking

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.669 
create a sort of a traditional looking
vignette<00:01:55.200> effect<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:57.170> again<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
vignette effect and again this is

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.410 
vignette effect and again this is
completely<00:01:59.069> reversible

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.850 

but<00:02:05.380> that's<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.860> all<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.189> do<00:02:06.490> with<00:02:06.729> masks

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
but that's not all you can do with masks

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520 
but that's not all you can do with masks
you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:08.890> also<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:10.660> something<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.080> bit<00:02:11.380> more

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you can also do something a bit more

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.180 
you can also do something a bit more
fancy<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.340> if<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.610> go<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.630> lair<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
fancy so if you go to the lair with the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.339 
fancy so if you go to the lair with the
mask<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.360> channels<00:02:16.870> you

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
mask on it then go to the channels you

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.040 
mask on it then go to the channels you
can<00:02:17.380> switch<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.910> mask<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
can switch on the mask and you can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.640 
can switch on the mask and you can
actually<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> mask<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.380> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
actually see the mask I in the in the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.840 
actually see the mask I in the in the
image<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.640> go<00:02:24.819> down<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.030> filters<00:02:25.780> distorts

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
image then go down to filters distorts

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.229 
image then go down to filters distorts
glass<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:30.430> long<00:02:30.550> as<00:02:30.670> you've<00:02:30.760> got<00:02:30.790> fairly

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
glass and as long as you've got fairly

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.729 
glass and as long as you've got fairly
decent<00:02:31.569> settings<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.080> should<00:02:32.260> allow<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.560> to

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
decent settings it should allow you to

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.720 
decent settings it should allow you to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you can see you need to switch off the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.110 
you can see you need to switch off the
mask<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.250> what<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.550> actually<00:02:39.580> looks<00:02:39.880> like

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
borders using this technique you can

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.940 
borders using this technique you can
even<00:02:45.580> use<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.970> liquify<00:02:46.330> tool<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:47.049> alter<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
even use the liquify tool to alter the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.259 
even use the liquify tool to alter the
mask<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:49.569> all<00:02:50.290> those<00:02:50.860> techniques<00:02:51.340> allow<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
to create inside borders what I want to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.820 
to create inside borders what I want to
do<00:02:55.120> now<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.390> show<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.959> how<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> create<00:02:56.530> an

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
do now to show you how to create an

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.800 
do now to show you how to create an
outside<00:02:57.400> border<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.890> go<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.950> image<00:03:00.810> canvas

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
outside border so go to image canvas

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.920 
outside border so go to image canvas
size<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:03.209> you've<00:03:04.209> got<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.480> make<00:03:04.630> sure<00:03:04.780> that

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
size and you've got to make sure that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.309 
size and you've got to make sure that
the<00:03:05.080> relative<00:03:05.799> box<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.610> ticked

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
the relative box is ticked

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.860 
the relative box is ticked
now<00:03:08.319> just<00:03:08.650> put<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.370> size<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.299> borders<00:03:10.690> that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
now just put in the size of borders that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.320 
now just put in the size of borders that
you<00:03:11.079> want<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:13.410> hit<00:03:14.410> OK

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
you want and hit OK

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.140 
you want and hit OK
and<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:17.050> creates<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.350> transparent<00:03:17.800> area

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and that creates a transparent area

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150 
and that creates a transparent area
there's<00:03:19.470> different<00:03:20.470> ways<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:20.980> then

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
there's different ways that you can then

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280 
there's different ways that you can then
create<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.820> border<00:03:22.240> here<00:03:22.450> I'm<00:03:22.870> creating<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.260> new

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.600 
create a border here I'm creating a new
layer<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:24.130> just<00:03:24.250> going<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.430> fill<00:03:24.580> that

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
layer and I'm just going to fill that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.820 
layer and I'm just going to fill that
layer<00:03:24.940> in<00:03:25.150> with<00:03:25.630> whatever<00:03:25.840> color<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.260> want<00:03:26.650> and

layer in with whatever color I want and
again<00:03:27.520> that<00:03:27.670> produces<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> very<00:03:28.390> regular

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
again that produces a very regular

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.490 
again that produces a very regular
