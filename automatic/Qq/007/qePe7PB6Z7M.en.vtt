00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
these dumb little fuckers but anyways
let's<00:02:25.190> talk<00:02:25.400> about<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.850> for<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.030> minute<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.480> think

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
let's talk about it for a minute I think

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.890 
let's talk about it for a minute I think
it's<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.290> good<00:02:27.530> thing<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.400> also<00:02:28.820> think<00:02:29.300> it's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
it's a good thing but I also think it's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.560 
it's a good thing but I also think it's
sort<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.740> bad<00:02:31.070> thing<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:32.120> let's<00:02:32.300> talk<00:02:32.510> about

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
sort of a bad thing but let's talk about

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.500 
sort of a bad thing but let's talk about
why<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.320> good<00:02:33.560> thing<00:02:33.770> first<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.490> think<00:02:35.390> it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
why it's a good thing first I think it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.260 
why it's a good thing first I think it's
a<00:02:35.600> good<00:02:35.810> thing<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.610> majority<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
a good thing because the majority of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.660 
a good thing because the majority of
gamers<00:02:38.900> don't<00:02:39.380> give<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.710> shit<00:02:40.010> about<00:02:40.040> connect

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
gamers don't give a shit about connect

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.970 
gamers don't give a shit about connect
we<00:02:41.330> don't<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.960> connect<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.470> I'm<00:02:42.650> sure

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
we don't want to connect and I'm sure

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.600 
we don't want to connect and I'm sure
this<00:02:43.430> will<00:02:43.490> bring<00:02:44.300> out<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> cheaper<00:02:45.350> bundle<00:02:46.310> for

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
this will bring out a cheaper bundle for

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.880 
this will bring out a cheaper bundle for
the<00:02:46.670> console<00:02:47.210> without<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:48.050> connect<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the console without the connect and I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.040 
the console without the connect and I
think<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> smart<00:02:49.490> move<00:02:49.940> by<00:02:50.420> Microsoft

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
think it's a smart move by Microsoft

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.040 
think it's a smart move by Microsoft
because<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.400> compete<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.120> ps4<00:02:53.420> if

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
because they can compete with the ps4 if

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.320 
because they can compete with the ps4 if
they<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> cheaper<00:02:55.100> bundle<00:02:55.490> out<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.150> like

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
they have a cheaper bundle out but like

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.840 
they have a cheaper bundle out but like
I<00:02:56.480> said<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.780> lot<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.230> people<00:02:57.410> like<00:02:58.280> me<00:02:58.310> are

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
I said a lot of people like me are

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.330 
I said a lot of people like me are
hardcore<00:02:59.630> gamers<00:03:00.170> don't<00:03:00.740> really<00:03:01.070> care<00:03:01.310> about

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
hardcore gamers don't really care about

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.370 
hardcore gamers don't really care about
the<00:03:01.700> connect<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.240> only<00:03:02.480> thing<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.870> excited

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
the connect the only thing that excited

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.890 
the connect the only thing that excited
me<00:03:03.410> was<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.610> fact<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:05.060> you'll<00:03:05.420> be<00:03:05.600> able<00:03:05.720> to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
me was the fact that you'll be able to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.320 
me was the fact that you'll be able to
have<00:03:06.080> voice<00:03:06.350> commands<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.270> change<00:03:08.270> your

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
have voice commands and change your

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.000 
have voice commands and change your
television<00:03:09.080> channels<00:03:09.500> with<00:03:09.680> your<00:03:09.830> voice

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
television channels with your voice

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.980 
television channels with your voice
instead<00:03:10.490> of<00:03:10.550> always<00:03:10.910> finding<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.690> remote

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
instead of always finding the remote

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.380 
instead of always finding the remote
that's<00:03:12.230> stuck<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.710> couch<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
that's stuck in the couch or in the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.050 
that's stuck in the couch or in the
bathroom<00:03:14.960> or<00:03:15.170> some<00:03:15.470> crazy<00:03:15.890> place<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.910> you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
bathroom or some crazy place that you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.030 
bathroom or some crazy place that you
can't<00:03:17.270> find<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> lot<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.500> people<00:03:18.800> didn't

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
can't find it so a lot of people didn't

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040 
can't find it so a lot of people didn't
want<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.370> kinect<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> first<00:03:20.150> place<00:03:20.360> so

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
want the kinect in the first place so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.740 
want the kinect in the first place so
let's<00:03:21.260> talk<00:03:21.470> about<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.950> bad<00:03:22.220> i<00:03:22.550> think<00:03:23.420> that

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
let's talk about the bad i think that

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.790 
let's talk about the bad i think that
eventually<00:03:24.280> connect<00:03:25.280> would<00:03:26.120> become<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:27.020> very

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
eventually connect would become a very

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.250 
eventually connect would become a very
interesting<00:03:28.670> part<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.150> our<00:03:29.270> video<00:03:29.510> games<00:03:29.960> i

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
interesting part in our video games i

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.440 
interesting part in our video games i
think<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.800> could<00:03:31.100> become<00:03:31.520> something<00:03:31.940> very

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
think it could become something very

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.440 
think it could become something very
very<00:03:32.840> cool<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.560> our<00:03:33.680> video<00:03:33.860> games<00:03:34.450> picture

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
very cool for our video games picture

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.690 
very cool for our video games picture
you're<00:03:35.750> crouched<00:03:36.230> down<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.890> call<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.130> duty<00:03:37.280> and

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
you're crouched down in call of duty and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.990 
you're crouched down in call of duty and
and<00:03:38.570> you're<00:03:38.870> you're<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.530> firefight<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.340> all

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
and you're you're in a firefight and all

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.120 
and you're you're in a firefight and all
you<00:03:41.180> gotta<00:03:41.330> do<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.540> flip<00:03:42.170> your<00:03:42.350> arm<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.710> throw<00:03:42.890> a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
you gotta do is flip your arm to throw a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.520 
you gotta do is flip your arm to throw a
frag<00:03:43.520> or<00:03:43.850> something<00:03:44.210> like<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.360> they<00:03:45.260> could

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
frag or something like that they could

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.170 
frag or something like that they could
have<00:03:45.620> found<00:03:45.800> really<00:03:46.190> really<00:03:46.640> cool<00:03:46.850> ways<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
have found really really cool ways to

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.930 
have found really really cool ways to
use<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.470> think<00:03:48.860> now<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.760> not

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
use this but I think now that it's not

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.230 
use this but I think now that it's not
mandatory<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:51.110> lot<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.980> developers<00:03:52.610> are<00:03:52.970> going

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
mandatory a lot of developers are going

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.330 
mandatory a lot of developers are going
to<00:03:53.390> skip<00:03:53.720> over<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.470> not<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:54.920> worry

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
to skip over it and not really worry

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.150 
to skip over it and not really worry
much<00:03:55.670> about<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.990> kinect<00:03:57.440> side<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:57.980> things

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
much about the kinect side of things

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.500 
much about the kinect side of things
they're<00:03:58.490> going<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.700> worry<00:03:58.880> about<00:03:59.000> making<00:03:59.270> a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
they're going to worry about making a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.510 
they're going to worry about making a
great<00:03:59.780> game<00:04:00.140> which<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.620> guess<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:01.070> good<00:04:01.160> thing

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
great game which I guess is a good thing

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.660 
great game which I guess is a good thing
but<00:04:02.390> connect<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.620> me<00:04:03.770> is<00:04:03.980> never<00:04:04.280> going<00:04:04.550> to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
but connect to me is never going to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.070 
but connect to me is never going to
evolve<00:04:05.300> unless<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.890> mandatory<00:04:07.280> and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
evolve unless it is mandatory and

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.870 
evolve unless it is mandatory and
publishers<00:04:09.080> have<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.590> find<00:04:09.890> ways<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.430> use<00:04:10.640> it

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
publishers have to find ways to use it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.450 
publishers have to find ways to use it
but<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.690> think<00:04:11.810> eventually<00:04:12.380> connect<00:04:13.130> will

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
but I think eventually connect will

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.170 
but I think eventually connect will
evolve<00:04:14.140> into<00:04:15.140> something<00:04:15.380> awesome<00:04:16.060> but<00:04:17.060> at

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
evolve into something awesome but at
