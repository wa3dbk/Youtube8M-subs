integration at national has been a part
of<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.020> national<00:02:29.470> has<00:02:29.680> been<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.160> still<00:02:30.190> is

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
of what national has been and still is

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.780 
of what national has been and still is
since<00:02:31.240> 1906<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.160> an<00:02:33.280> idea<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.610> our

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
since 1906 so this is an idea that our

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.070 
since 1906 so this is an idea that our
students<00:02:34.210> are<00:02:34.330> colleagues<00:02:34.690> within<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
students are colleagues within the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.910 
students are colleagues within the
healthcare<00:02:35.320> field<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.950> not<00:02:36.520> competitors

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.040 

this<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.340> definitely<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.060> easy<00:02:46.120> being<00:02:46.960> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
this is definitely not easy being a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.870 
this is definitely not easy being a
doctor<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.590> very<00:02:47.620> difficult<00:02:48.400> thing<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
doctor is very difficult thing and I

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610 
doctor is very difficult thing and I
think<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.210> more<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.660> calling<00:02:49.840> rather<00:02:50.320> than

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
think it's more of a calling rather than

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.250 
think it's more of a calling rather than
just<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.670> profession<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.480> someone<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:52.870> goes

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
just a profession that someone just goes
