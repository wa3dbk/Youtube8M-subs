we're not going there so my comrades are
dead<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:03.160> am<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:03.730> going<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.970> run<00:03:04.270> around

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
dead and I am just going to run around

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.260 
dead and I am just going to run around
to<00:03:04.960> see<00:03:05.170> or<00:03:06.040> try<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> dodge<00:03:06.580> his<00:03:06.880> attack

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
to see or try to dodge his attack

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.380 
to see or try to dodge his attack
anyways<00:03:07.750> Oh<00:03:09.540> No

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.020 

so<00:03:14.960> this<00:03:15.170> guy<00:03:15.350> isn't<00:03:15.560> too<00:03:15.800> happy<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:19.030> guess

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
so this guy isn't too happy I guess

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.970

being locked ooh we got hit

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.190 
being locked ooh we got hit
I<00:03:22.010> guess<00:03:22.700> being<00:03:22.970> locked<00:03:23.270> up<00:03:23.510> does<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.900> isn't

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
I guess being locked up does it isn't

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.350 
I guess being locked up does it isn't
really<00:03:25.150> satisfying<00:03:27.910> all<00:03:28.910> right<00:03:29.090> we're<00:03:29.240> gonna

00:06:58.829 --> 00:06:58.839 
actually let's go in here and take a

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.600 
actually let's go in here and take a
look<00:06:58.990> at<00:06:59.139> it<00:06:59.319> I<00:06:59.439> already<00:06:59.620> beated<00:07:00.219> some<00:07:00.430> of<00:07:00.520> the

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
look at it I already beated some of the

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.760 
look at it I already beated some of the
levels<00:07:00.969> because<00:07:01.659> they<00:07:01.809> glitched<00:07:02.110> out<00:07:02.379> and<00:07:02.620> let

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
levels because they glitched out and let

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.480 
levels because they glitched out and let
me<00:07:02.889> in<00:07:03.069> right<00:07:03.399> so<00:07:04.089> I<00:07:05.080> guess<00:07:05.589> we<00:07:05.919> will<00:07:06.099> be<00:07:06.249> going

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490

me in right so I guess we will be going
through<00:07:06.729> level<00:07:07.419> 21<00:07:07.689> 22<00:07:08.259> 23<00:07:08.589> 24<00:07:08.800> but<00:07:09.729> we<00:07:09.819> are<00:07:09.939> a

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.279 
through level 21 22 23 24 but we are a
beat<00:07:10.360> some<00:07:11.110> of<00:07:11.139> the<00:07:11.259> levels<00:07:11.620> but<00:07:11.860> oh<00:07:12.069> wow
