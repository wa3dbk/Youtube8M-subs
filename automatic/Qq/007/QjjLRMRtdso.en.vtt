00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.480
 but many welcome has sent more and 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.859
 good this time I bring you a video 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.469
 very interesting that I was just 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.599
 happen and it occurred to me like three ago 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.639
 minutes I was literally lying 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.950
 checking my cell phone and I got into 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.400
 3h twitter and read this I read your 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.800
 biography and before I start I want 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.119
 tell them something 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.730
 this is an idea of ​​mine, that is, there is no 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.039
 rumors there are no leaks there is no 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.590
 no or no evidence to believe 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.170
 this is simply an idea that I had 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.110
 as it says in the title a game only of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.510
 zombies is a very old idea to be 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.340
 sincere but it already relates it to many 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.620
 things and that's what I want to give them to 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
 understand in this video but always 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.980
 we had that it was just a game of zombies or 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.990
 be it only bring zombie stuff 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.350
 nothing of nothing multiplayer campaign alone 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.820
 zombies that is focused on that and good 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.430
 always very far but now I have a 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.470
 little hope that really is very 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.930
 small but the same is going to share 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.700
 this because I find it very interesting 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.370
 this image that you are seeing from the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.650
 they had official to detract as 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.570
 can you see I'm going to translate what the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.180
 biography is this is the official account 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.580
 of twitter of three studios and the place 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.890
 of call of duty zombies ok 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.900
 speaks and literally a call of duty 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.180
 zombies tells us about nothing else if we 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.430
 let's go to the infinity ward talking about 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.410
 carlos of rich and all that and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 possibly in this year the future if 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.460
 we get into the slider game is going to talk 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.500
 from dead to see 4 but this time 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.869
 from 3h does not tell us the place of birth 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.300
 of call of duty black ops' or of the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.950
 whites two or nothing tells us call of duty 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.500
 zombies directly is giving us a 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.380
 direct man now that with I want 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.940
 relationships me if we remember zombies 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
 it is assumed that until 2015 we are going to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.100
 have a new game 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.079
 and that this year since June is light 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
 summer games studios and that if you know 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.909
 but good now what I am 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.030
 thinking was that we say that activision 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.740
 said ok to withdraw now you just 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.229
 it's going to be a zombie game just over 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.060
 zombies and let's put ashley number 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.340
 game to say let's follow the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720
 tradition of each year of normal game of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.180
 call of duty or be like the original saga 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.700
 that would be multiplayer campaign a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.610
 survival there is of anyone like that of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.549
 modern warfare 3 ok then of them 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 they said it 's fine but now what is not 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.680
 we know is that how often will this be 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.840
 game and the music itself every three years as 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.299
 comes out every two years sorry as 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.010
 has been what is known or say 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.630
 that this year serve in modern warfare 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.310
 4 for telling them something and knowing that between 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.410
 the tours and zombies and that heat and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.569
 zombies simply to update 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.569
 and trouble dlcs be maintained a couple of years 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.819
 and did not affect the sales delayed to have 4 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.390
 let's say it goes 2 to this 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.190
 of some name 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 it would be something very interesting and they can 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.990
 think let's say that every year we have 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 after clear zombies during the the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.490
 multiplayer so they understand we have 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 americans law infinity ward 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.380
 sledgehammer games infinity ward but 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 trias have their own let's say the own 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.920
 game apart that has nothing to do 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.900
 with those two that simply be a 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.900
 saga part of call of duty that sell it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.770
 aside every so often the year let's say 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.270
 in 2015 or last until 2017 2016 and 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.700
 warns not to touch it south and they are my two 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.530
 aunts and go taking it out and also another 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.540
 which makes us believe that we say that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.459
 this can be true is that if 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.989
 let's go to twitter's three account or 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.570
 of facebook either of the two and 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.540
 we review we can say that 90 by 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.820
 95% percent of the publications are only 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.650
 of zombies that is very strange because 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.540
 we only enter the facebook and we are going to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.220
 go down and down and down and let's see that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 almost everything they publish has to do 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.940
 with zombies to include what they do 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.739
 retweet and what they raise almost always 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.480
 it has to do with zombies even up 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.220
 what even the camouflage had 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.390
 a lot to do with zombies and can not 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 to say no 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.950
 that would be let's say that another test by 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.440
 say to say it somehow is not 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.080
 a test simply put your 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.280
 side to tell you something please leave me 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.560
 the comments what do you think of this 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.770
 little idea is a very long life of 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.550
 day is a quick attitude idea or 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.959
 I was literally lying down 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.270
 it happened I said motherfucker and I have to 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.070
 share it with everyone then please 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.290
 leave your comments in your comments 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.660
 why do you think it's good because it 's 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.820
 they think it's bad and please express 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.410
 expression daring mind because they think 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.239
 what's going to be like that or what's not going to be 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.620
 well, as I said, there is nothing 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.880
 confirmed there are not even rumors nor 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.340
 leaks or any evidence 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.169
 simply what I did on twitter that 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.610
 it occurred to me and I hope that they have 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.600
 liked the video my name roberto is a 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.600
 goodbye video
