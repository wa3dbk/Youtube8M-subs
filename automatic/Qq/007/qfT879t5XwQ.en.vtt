00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that it will cover the clipboard and the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
that it will cover the clipboard and the
next<00:01:22.350> step<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.859> to<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.880> aleene's<00:01:24.479> matt

next step is to use your aleene's matt
decoupage<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.490> could<00:01:26.670> also<00:01:26.820> use<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.539> gloss

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
decoupage you could also use the gloss

decoupage you could also use the gloss
finish<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.750> start<00:01:30.750> brushing<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.289> on<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
finish and start brushing it on to the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.779 
finish and start brushing it on to the

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
clipboard and you want to move fairly

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.620 
clipboard and you want to move fairly
quickly<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.719> this<00:01:37.200> step<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.880> soak<00:01:39.299> into

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
quickly in this step this will soak into

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.279 
quickly in this step this will soak into
your<00:01:39.869> clipboard<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.539> so<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:42.600> want<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
quickly set this aside so that we can

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.580 
quickly set this aside so that we can
apply<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.369> decoupage<00:02:02.999> medium<00:02:03.179> on<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.409> the

back of our cut paper and apply this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.380 
back of our cut paper and apply this
right<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:10.110> onto<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.280> wet<00:02:11.580> decoupage<00:02:12.360> medium

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.260 
right down onto the wet decoupage medium
that's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's
on<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> clipboard<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.850> few

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.300 
this is where it's really important that
you<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.930> enough<00:02:50.170> medium<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.040> still

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you have enough medium so it still

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.690 
you have enough medium so it still
remains<00:02:51.700> wet<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:54.010> push<00:02:54.310> out<00:02:54.520> those

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
remains wet for you to push out those

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.020 
remains wet for you to push out those
bubbles<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.470> finally<00:02:57.040> I'll<00:02:57.190> come<00:02:57.460> back<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
bubbles and finally I'll come back in to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.490 
bubbles and finally I'll come back in to
smooth<00:02:58.390> out<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.890> decoupage<00:03:00.250> medium<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:01.500> then

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
smooth out the decoupage medium and then

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.480 
smooth out the decoupage medium and then
you<00:03:03.010> would<00:03:03.310> let<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.700> dry<00:03:04.030> completely<00:03:05.490> for

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
you would let this dry completely for

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.210 
you would let this dry completely for
the<00:03:06.670> next<00:03:07.060> step<00:03:07.180> in<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.450> project<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.230> want<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the next step in this project I want to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.090 
the next step in this project I want to
layer<00:03:09.850> several<00:03:10.480> pieces<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.500> my<00:03:11.680> scrapbook

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
want it to find it fairly closely but it

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.400 
want it to find it fairly closely but it
doesn't<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.550> be<00:03:27.580> exact<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.810> cut<00:03:29.170> this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
doesn't have to be exact we can cut this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.070 
doesn't have to be exact we can cut this
down<00:03:29.709> when<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.670> piece<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.060> dry<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.930> all

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
down when the piece is dry so that all

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.370
