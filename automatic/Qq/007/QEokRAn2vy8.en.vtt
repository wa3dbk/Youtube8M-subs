I Drive a truck full of him first to
take<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> road<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.720> Neal<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.470> see<00:00:52.680> what

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
take to the road is Neal let's see what

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
take to the road is Neal let's see what
he<00:00:53.040> makes<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> proton<00:00:55.730> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.790> trucks<00:00:57.540> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
he makes of the proton in the trucks I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
he makes of the proton in the trucks I
tend<00:00:58.080> to<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> stiff<00:00:59.040> neck<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.610> shoulder

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.160 
tend to get a stiff neck and shoulder
thought<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:01.290> with<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.489> probably

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
thought think with this I could probably

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.969 
thought think with this I could probably
quite<00:01:04.170> easily<00:01:04.320> drive<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
quite easily drive it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.550 
quite easily drive it
so<00:01:06.380> wherever<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:08.940> problem

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
so wherever them back with no problem

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
so wherever them back with no problem
the<00:01:10.560> driving<00:01:10.920> positions<00:01:11.250> God<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> seats

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the driving positions God and the seats

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
the driving positions God and the seats
comfy<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> dust<00:01:16.200> layouts<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.360> when

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
comfy the dust layouts all right when

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
comfy the dust layouts all right when
you're<00:01:18.660> turning<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.700> flooring<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you're turning off your flooring it a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.300 
you're turning off your flooring it a
bit<00:01:21.210> too<00:01:21.450> hard<00:01:21.750> you're<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:23.039> any<00:01:23.190> bit

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
bit too hard you're going to see any bit

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.930 
bit too hard you're going to see any bit
of<00:01:23.399> wheelspin<00:01:23.960> when<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.110> turning<00:01:25.940> other

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
of wheelspin when you're turning other

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.850 
of wheelspin when you're turning other
than<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.530> handling<00:01:28.530> brilliantly<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:30.860> think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
than that handling brilliantly I think

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170 
than that handling brilliantly I think
it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.160> about<00:01:32.369> ten<00:01:32.610> years<00:01:32.789> younger<00:01:32.910> I'd

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it was about ten years younger I'd

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.779 
it was about ten years younger I'd
probably<00:01:33.330> buy<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.979> while<00:01:34.979> its<00:01:35.160> mate<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.550> still

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
probably buy one while its mate is still

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.550 
probably buy one while its mate is still
blasting<00:01:36.060> round<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> proton<00:01:37.170> let's<00:01:37.410> see

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
blasting round in the proton let's see

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.279 
blasting round in the proton let's see
what<00:01:37.740> self-confessed<00:01:38.399> VW<00:01:39.119> man<00:01:39.360> Phil<00:01:39.750> thinks

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
what self-confessed VW man Phil thinks

not about the legroom in the front when
you<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> truck<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
you get out of the truck it's like

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
you get out of the truck it's like
getting<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.820> slight<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.270> into<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> go-kart

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
getting in slight get into a go-kart

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
getting in slight get into a go-kart
getting<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.070> something<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> likes

of this everything you just feel very
low<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> ground

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
low to the ground

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.390 

then<00:02:02.820> appear<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> acceleration<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
then appear the acceleration the the

then appear the acceleration the the
steering<00:02:05.760> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> cars<00:02:06.240> actually<00:02:06.990> varies<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
steering on the cars actually varies it

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.620 
steering on the cars actually varies it
is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.460> nice<00:02:08.610> steer<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.300> over

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
is a very nice steer and it's not over

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.940 
is a very nice steer and it's not over
light<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.170> too<00:02:10.440> heavy

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
light it's not too heavy

light it's not too heavy
I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.490> it's<00:02:11.640> designed<00:02:11.940> by<00:02:12.090> racer<00:02:12.660> which<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
I think it's designed by racer which I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.100 
I think it's designed by racer which I
think<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.260> designed<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:15.330> younger<00:02:15.750> for

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
think it's designed for the younger for

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.260 
think it's designed for the younger for
the<00:02:16.260> light<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> 20<00:02:17.550> light<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:18.000> passed

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the light for the 20 light just passed

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990 
the light for the 20 light just passed
the<00:02:18.390> test<00:02:18.630> between<00:02:19.470> 1825<00:02:20.430> something<00:02:20.850> like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the test between 1825 something like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.460 
the test between 1825 something like
that<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.510> think<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> more<00:02:21.990> more

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that I think I think the more more

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.030

sporty<00:02:23.750> well<00:02:24.750> had<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> drivers<00:02:25.680> should<00:02:25.890> be

sporty well had to drivers should be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.650 
sporty well had to drivers should be
about<00:02:26.250> midway<00:02:26.700> through<00:02:26.730> their<00:02:27.090> tests<00:02:27.420> by<00:02:27.600> now

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
about midway through their tests by now

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.350 
about midway through their tests by now
so<00:02:27.990> they<00:02:28.110> should<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.680> changing<00:02:29.160> cars<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:29.760> in

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
so they should be changing cars but in

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600 
so they should be changing cars but in
the<00:02:30.540> mean<00:02:30.690> time<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:31.290> can't<00:02:31.590> resist<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the mean time I can't resist it it's a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.089 
the mean time I can't resist it it's a
big<00:02:32.790> lorry<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.240> got<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> vago

time then for a swap Neal seem to be

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.039 
time then for a swap Neal seem to be
having<00:02:43.129> fun<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> proton<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.719> can<00:02:44.959> the

having fun in the proton so can the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.770 
having fun in the proton so can the
Volkswagen<00:02:45.620> match<00:02:45.799> up<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.780> first

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
Volkswagen match up to it first

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.259 
Volkswagen match up to it first
impression<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.439> this<00:02:48.650> car<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.189> I<00:02:49.549> do<00:02:49.639> not<00:02:50.030> like

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
impression of this car is I do not like

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.770 
impression of this car is I do not like
it<00:02:50.540> go<00:02:51.499> are<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:53.200> pedal<00:02:54.200> physicians<00:02:55.780> cannot

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it go are the pedal physicians cannot

it go are the pedal physicians cannot
get<00:02:56.989> comfy<00:02:57.639> doesn't<00:02:58.639> respond<00:02:58.969> straight<00:02:59.299> away

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
get comfy doesn't respond straight away

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.780 
get comfy doesn't respond straight away
I<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.799> wife<00:03:04.010> would<00:03:04.250> probably<00:03:04.609> like

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
I think the wife would probably like

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.429 
I think the wife would probably like
this<00:03:05.000> more<00:03:05.420> than<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.659> proton<00:03:06.049> literally

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
this more than the proton literally

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.809 
this more than the proton literally
because<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.799> five<00:03:07.010> doors<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.609> would<00:03:07.700> be

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
because the five doors and it would be

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.599 
because the five doors and it would be
easier<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.209> her<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:09.560> at<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.159> end<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.430> day

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
easier for her and at the end of the day

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.610 
easier for her and at the end of the day
so<00:03:10.909> is<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.150> almonds<00:03:11.389> choice<00:03:11.749> and<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.139> proton

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
so is the almonds choice and the proton

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.679 
so is the almonds choice and the proton
with<00:03:12.859> all<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.069> its<00:03:13.189> Eastern<00:03:13.639> promise<00:03:14.060> tempt

overall look it's a sporty looking thing

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.409 
overall look it's a sporty looking thing
but<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.480> think<00:03:27.049> they've<00:03:27.230> gone<00:03:27.439> a<00:03:28.180> little<00:03:29.180> bit

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
but I think they've gone a little bit

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.000 
but I think they've gone a little bit
far<00:03:29.689> with<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> arch<00:03:30.139> gets<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.709> little<00:03:30.799> bit

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
far with the arch gets a little bit

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.470 
far with the arch gets a little bit
tacky<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.609> arch<00:03:31.760> Kitson<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.530> clocks<00:03:33.889> and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
it's a cab of fiber lock on the dash

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.289 
it's a cab of fiber lock on the dash
it's<00:03:39.469> slightly<00:03:40.280> slightly<00:03:40.879> better<00:03:41.150> on
