00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 expensive fire is all he 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 rest of the adama buggy buggy big shot of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.590
 this cache not that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.439
 it's not the good news no no 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is ready to fly so there we do not 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.730
 can not recover the gains we will know 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 never what happened to bollée 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.329
 bad day racing baptism 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.270
 delicate for the evolution 3 of abuse that 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.590
 house appeared in 2013 difficult for 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.210
 philippe gache to regain the rhythm 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.970
 eighteen months after his last run 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.739
 the 39th boss of the general this morning comes 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.870
 to give up on mechanical problem 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.449
 the hopes of the house rests 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.339
 now on ronan chabot 18th to 45 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.050
 minutes idle yesterday by a broken 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.970
 of shock absorber the dealer sold 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.370
 so the ninth time of the day 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.750
 sharply the chili the sand and the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 first dunes for ronan sculpin 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.470
 since they suffer from it yesterday 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.900
 guerlain chicherit has lived everything 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.520
 returned late to the bivouac clutch 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 out of used little consolation 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 today with the 23rd time 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.300
 1 1 $ rent robby gordon 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.830
 did not surprisingly find any customers and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.050
 it's not the boss's benefit that 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.660
 will attract the barge 48th of the general 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.010
 Gordon and his gordini already have more than 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.010
 four hours in the musette 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.270
 these young people and that thinks they know everything 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.030
 at 34 mireille poulter is arguing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.170
 second dakar 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.330
 preceded by a flattering reputation 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 the appointed heir of giniel de villiers 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.119
 still have a lot to learn 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.320
 in shock the South African champion 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.300
 rallies this season corrects 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.360
 severely the parallelism of the train 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.560
 before his toyota balance sheet more than one 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.560
 lost time 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.390
 this third step is the most beautiful 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.069
 for the Peugeot since the departure the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.349
 2008 reveals its potential little by little 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.170
 carlos sainz signs the 4th time at 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.209
 four minutes of the winner of the day 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.630
 Stéphane Peterhansel finishes 7th to 9th 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.900
 minutes 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:39.769
 on his side Cyril Despres shows the last 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:41.330
 from the hood to the 14th rank of the stage in his 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.340
 learning the fivefold winner 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.650
 motorcycle can draw inspiration from christian 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.660
 the old woman on four wheels 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.000
 twelve years to an example to follow 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.860
 formed in soda passed by great wall 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 the old woman has this season a 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.530
 Toyota 10th of the day is 9th overall 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.420
 also has the toyota 2015 version 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.709
 and that changes everything especially when we 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.349
 got his hands in rally raid on a 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.860
 hummer yazeed al rajhi signs the 3rd 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.989
 time of the day 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.239
 the Saudi is still fighting his first 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.769
 dakar leaders of the world championship 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.109
 rally al rajhi is in good school 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.090
 his co-pilot and the experienced timoko of 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.510
 each winner of the Dakar in 2011 with 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.280
 a certain nasser al attiyah 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.310
 we learn about the dakar this is only the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.750
 third day you know we need 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.359
 to learn again to have 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.989
 the experience to have a good rhythm and 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.720
 won next year nasser al attiyah 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.000
 precisely fifth of the day the leader of the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.519
 overall classification concedes 2 minutes 24 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.209
 to giniel de villiers 5 minutes 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.209
 separate to the general 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.020
 two trees up 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.870
 today our plan was simple no 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.060
 not too push the car because tomorrow 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.410
 we want to be able to follow jean yelle and 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.410
 it's a better position for us 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.750
 initially we talked a lot about peugeot 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.470
 a lot of mini is very little toyota 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.300
 true to his habits 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.010
 giniel de villiers led the 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.950
 development of the workshop in 2015 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.510
 discreetly in namibia the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.489
 performance interviews at the rally 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.950
 Morocco this fall should have alerted the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.560
 competition always placed the winner 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.250
 2009 finishes second at a 54 of the 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.250
 winner of the day 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.890
 it was physically hard 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.150
 there were big stretches but 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.010
 with cuts and seals 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.750
 had to stay focused it was not necessary 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.190
 not to make mistakes especially not it's 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.530
 easy to commit and crash 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.419
 in this case with him it's 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.140
 all one or all the other in nine 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.390
 holdings 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.280
 orlando terranova completed only one 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.140
 only once on his lands 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.140
 the Argentine maintains his reputation 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.000
 anthony yesterday in conqueror today 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.520

 and yes there is also a ladybug on the 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.590
 dakar the double life of stéphane henrard 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.830
 quietly but surely 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.030
 road in 38th position 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.030
