it<00:02:38.629> so<00:02:38.810> much<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.230> what<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.379> find<00:02:39.680> with<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.920> root

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
it so much and what I find with the root

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.240 
it so much and what I find with the root
touch-up<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:42.079> I<00:02:42.200> probably<00:02:42.469> do<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.920> every

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
touch-up is and I probably do that every

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.660 
touch-up is and I probably do that every
month<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:45.200> probably<00:02:45.439> dye<00:02:45.769> my<00:02:46.069> hair<00:02:46.099> right

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670

month and I probably dye my hair right
the<00:02:46.849> way<00:02:46.970> through<00:02:47.000> because<00:02:47.540> sometimes<00:02:47.689> it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
the way through because sometimes it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.990 
the way through because sometimes it
loses<00:02:48.349> color<00:02:48.799> on<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.129> ends<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.639> starts

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
loses color on the ends and it starts

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.119 
loses color on the ends and it starts
looking<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.269> bit<00:02:50.389> gingery<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.049> horrible<00:02:51.409> but<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
looking a bit gingery and horrible but I

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.050 
looking a bit gingery and horrible but I
try<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.489> do<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.879> maybe<00:02:53.060> only<00:02:53.329> twice<00:02:53.689> a<00:02:53.900> year

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
try to do that maybe only twice a year

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.699 
try to do that maybe only twice a year
just<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> get<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.450> full<00:02:56.689> color<00:02:56.989> back<00:02:57.230> into<00:02:57.560> my

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.979 
just to get the full color back into my
hair<00:02:57.919> and<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.669> rest<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> time<00:02:59.299> I<00:02:59.569> just

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
hair and the rest of the time I just

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.440 
hair and the rest of the time I just
leave<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.530> um<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.609> couldn't<00:03:02.239> maintain

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.920 
leave it um I just couldn't maintain
this<00:03:02.959> length<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.409> hair<00:03:03.620> if<00:03:03.919> I<00:03:04.159> was<00:03:04.930> colouring

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
this length of hair if I was colouring

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.429 
this length of hair if I was colouring
and<00:03:06.049> styling<00:03:06.620> my<00:03:06.739> hair<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.049> every<00:03:09.379> other

day<00:03:09.769> or<00:03:09.980> every<00:03:10.010> day<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.480> find<00:03:11.720> this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
day or every day so I just find this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.509 
day or every day so I just find this
product<00:03:12.470> actually<00:03:12.590> brilliant<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.310> guess

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
product actually brilliant and I guess

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.860 
product actually brilliant and I guess
if<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:13.939> didn't<00:03:14.180> want<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.359> use<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.689> roots

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
if you didn't want to use the roots

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.780 
if you didn't want to use the roots
touch-up<00:03:15.290> which<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.799> think<00:03:15.979> retails<00:03:16.579> it

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
touch-up which is I think retails it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.000 
touch-up which is I think retails it
it's<00:03:17.449> usually<00:03:17.629> on<00:03:17.870> offer<00:03:18.079> but<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.620> retails

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
it's usually on offer but it retails

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.939 
it's usually on offer but it retails
around<00:03:19.250> three<00:03:19.489> four<00:03:19.879> pound<00:03:20.540> 65<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:21.379> you<00:03:21.799> can

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
around three four pound 65 but you can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.149 
around three four pound 65 but you can
actually<00:03:22.099> use<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:23.449> a<00:03:23.629> normal<00:03:24.229> hair<00:03:24.560> dye<00:03:24.889> and

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
actually use just a normal hair dye and

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.490 
actually use just a normal hair dye and
mix<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:26.030> tiny<00:03:26.419> little<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.079> if<00:03:27.229> you've<00:03:27.379> just

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
mix a tiny little bit in if you've just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.080 
mix a tiny little bit in if you've just
got<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.739> few<00:03:27.919> Gray's<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.609> need<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.909> cover

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
got a few Gray's that you need to cover

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.969 
got a few Gray's that you need to cover
up<00:03:29.359> that's<00:03:29.989> actually<00:03:30.139> quite<00:03:30.379> a<00:03:30.500> cheap<00:03:30.739> way<00:03:30.919> of

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
up that's actually quite a cheap way of

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.129 
up that's actually quite a cheap way of
doing<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.639> obviously<00:03:32.540> don't<00:03:32.900> mix<00:03:33.049> a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
doing it just obviously don't mix a

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.619 
doing it just obviously don't mix a
whole<00:03:33.290> lot<00:03:33.500> makes<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.549> tiny<00:03:34.729> bit<00:03:34.970> at<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.150> time<00:03:35.389> and

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
whole lot makes a tiny bit at a time and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.599 
whole lot makes a tiny bit at a time and
apply<00:03:36.409> it<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.739> hey<00:03:37.489> presto<00:03:37.940> you've<00:03:39.609> you

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609

and<00:03:43.569> sometimes<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.810> summer<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.199> like<00:03:45.409> a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and sometimes in the summer I like a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.580 
and sometimes in the summer I like a
little<00:03:45.829> bit<00:03:46.099> of<00:03:46.540> my<00:03:47.540> hair<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:48.109> be<00:03:48.229> a<00:03:48.260> little<00:03:48.500> bit

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
little bit of my hair to be a little bit

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.250 
little bit of my hair to be a little bit
lighter<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:48.979> I<00:03:49.489> will<00:03:49.819> just<00:03:50.060> literally<00:03:50.870> get<00:03:51.079> a

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
lighter so I will just literally get a

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.429 
lighter so I will just literally get a
highlighting<00:03:51.919> kit<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:53.659> never<00:03:54.109> go<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.349> the

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
highlighting kit and I never go to the

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.259 
highlighting kit and I never go to the
hairdresser's<00:03:54.889> for<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.189> because<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.909> just

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
hairdresser's for this because I just

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.149 
hairdresser's for this because I just
find<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.900> they<00:03:57.019> put<00:03:57.260> too<00:03:57.470> many<00:03:57.620> highlights

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
find that they put too many highlights

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.000 
find that they put too many highlights
in<00:03:58.449> and<00:03:59.449> I<00:03:59.540> don't<00:03:59.599> like<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.019> all<00:04:00.379> over<00:04:00.680> blonde
