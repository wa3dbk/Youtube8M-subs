see<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> term<00:01:02.359> steerer<00:01:03.359> diameter<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> that's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
see the term steerer diameter and that's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
see the term steerer diameter and that's
referring<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> front<00:01:06.210> forks<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> are

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
referring to the front forks that are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
referring to the front forks that are
compatible<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.520> size<00:01:08.880> head<00:01:09.450> tube<00:01:10.909> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
compatible with this size head tube so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.060 
compatible with this size head tube so
when<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> ordered<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> kit<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> didn't<00:01:13.770> pay

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
when I ordered this kit I didn't pay

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
when I ordered this kit I didn't pay
enough<00:01:14.250> attention<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.619> head<00:01:16.619> tube<00:01:16.799> size

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
enough attention to the head tube size

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
enough attention to the head tube size
and<00:01:17.540> turns<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> size<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> actually

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and turns out that the size I actually

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
and turns out that the size I actually
need<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> thirty-six<00:01:21.299> point<00:01:21.540> five

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
need is a thirty-six point five

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.490 
need is a thirty-six point five
millimeter<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> I'll<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> order<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
millimeter so I'll have to order that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
millimeter so I'll have to order that
separately<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.770> top<00:01:29.100> tube<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
separately this is the top tube and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.039 
separately this is the top tube and
that's<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> information<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.189> let<00:01:32.670> me

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
that's a lot of information so let me

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.760 
that's a lot of information so let me
explain<00:01:34.049> this

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
explain this

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.429 
explain this
all<00:01:36.340> right<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.820> 3d<00:01:37.299> representation<00:01:37.899> of

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
all right this is a 3d representation of

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.639 
all right this is a 3d representation of
a<00:01:38.590> tube<00:01:38.829> and<00:01:39.609> if<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.329> were<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.509> cut<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.409> tube

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
a tube and if you were to cut the tube

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.999 
a tube and if you were to cut the tube
down<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.670> center<00:01:43.179> and<00:01:43.509> we<00:01:44.469> were<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.649> just<00:01:44.799> look

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
down the center and we were to just look

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.830 
down the center and we were to just look
at<00:01:45.130> half<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.549> tube<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.210> would<00:01:46.360> see<00:01:46.570> that

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
at half of the tube you would see that

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.749 
at half of the tube you would see that
one<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.909> sides<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.990> thicker<00:01:50.319> and<00:01:50.649> this<00:01:51.609> is

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
one of the sides is thicker and this is

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.300 
one of the sides is thicker and this is
what's<00:01:51.939> known<00:01:52.090> as<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.360> butt<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.079> then<00:01:54.069> where

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
what's known as the butt and then where

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.669 
what's known as the butt and then where
it<00:01:54.369> starts<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.700> thin<00:01:55.149> out<00:01:55.329> that<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.380> butt

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
it starts to thin out that is the butt

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.600 
it starts to thin out that is the butt
taper<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:59.229> thin<00:01:59.679> side<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.369> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
taper and then the thin side is just the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.709 
taper and then the thin side is just the
regular<00:02:00.969> tube<00:02:02.100> okay<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.159> then<00:02:03.610> if<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:04.119> were<00:02:04.329> to

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
regular tube okay so then if you were to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.249 
regular tube okay so then if you were to
have<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.409> tube<00:02:05.649> with<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.520> fixed<00:02:07.060> side<00:02:07.270> on<00:02:07.630> both

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
have a tube with a fixed side on both

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.150 
have a tube with a fixed side on both
ends<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.599> thin<00:02:10.780> side<00:02:10.989> thin<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.099> middle

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
ends and a thin side thin in the middle

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.339 
ends and a thin side thin in the middle
that's<00:02:12.760> what's<00:02:12.970> known<00:02:13.120> as<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.540> double<00:02:13.750> butted

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
that's what's known as a double butted

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.690 
that's what's known as a double butted
tube<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.599> also<00:02:16.870> another<00:02:17.290> tube<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
tube there is also another tube that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.759 
tube there is also another tube that
just<00:02:18.700> has<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:19.239> butt<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:19.810> one<00:02:20.079> end<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> that's

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
just has a butt on one end and that's

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.089 
just has a butt on one end and that's
what's<00:02:20.980> known<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> single<00:02:22.090> butted<00:02:22.510> tube<00:02:23.099> so

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
what's known as a single butted tube so

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.370 
what's known as a single butted tube so
the<00:02:24.190> reason<00:02:24.400> why<00:02:24.519> tubes<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.450> exist<00:02:26.079> is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the reason why tubes like this exist is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.699 
the reason why tubes like this exist is
it<00:02:26.709> makes<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.250> tube<00:02:27.640> lighter<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.470> also

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
it makes the tube lighter but it also

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.280 
it makes the tube lighter but it also
makes<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.190> strong<00:02:30.549> on<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> end<00:02:31.000> where<00:02:31.329> it<00:02:32.079> gets

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
makes it strong on the end where it gets

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.630 
makes it strong on the end where it gets
welded<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:32.920> other<00:02:33.069> tubes<00:02:33.629> okay<00:02:34.629> so<00:02:34.810> this

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
welded to the other tubes okay so this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
welded to the other tubes okay so this
makes<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.730> lot<00:02:36.819> more<00:02:36.879> sense<00:02:37.030> now<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.709> tube

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
makes a lot more sense now so this tube

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.449 
makes a lot more sense now so this tube
has<00:02:39.129> a<00:02:39.160> button<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.239> end<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.459> 102

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
has a button on one end with a 102

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.289 
has a button on one end with a 102
millimeter<00:02:43.980> length<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.760> length<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.209> that

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
millimeter length so the length of that

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.780 
millimeter length so the length of that
butt<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.720> under<00:02:46.989> two<00:02:47.139> millimeters<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:48.639> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
butt is under two millimeters on the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.090 
butt is under two millimeters on the
other<00:02:48.940> end<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.389> has<00:02:49.690> another<00:02:49.989> 102<00:02:50.650> millimeter

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
other end it has another 102 millimeter

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.020 
other end it has another 102 millimeter
butt<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.750> has<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> 63<00:02:53.500> millimeter<00:02:54.010> taper<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.790> a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
butt and has a 63 millimeter taper and a

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:18.790 
butt and has a 63 millimeter taper and a
center<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.489> 270<00:02:57.489> millimeters

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.030 

all<00:03:19.800> right<00:03:19.920> these<00:03:20.070> are<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> chainstays<00:03:20.970> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
all right these are the chainstays and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.170 
all right these are the chainstays and
they<00:03:23.040> are<00:03:23.250> round<00:03:23.820> oval<00:03:24.390> round<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:25.370> RoR<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
they are round oval round or RoR and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.810 
they are round oval round or RoR and
what<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.630> means<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.080> one<00:03:28.500> end<00:03:28.710> is<00:03:29.010> totally

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
what that means is one end is totally

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.510 
what that means is one end is totally
round<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.380> other<00:03:31.530> end<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.920> totally<00:03:32.310> round

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
round and the other end is totally round

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.820 
round and the other end is totally round
but<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.180> center<00:03:33.600> if<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.840> were<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> cut<00:03:34.620> this

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
but the center if you were to cut this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.340 
but the center if you were to cut this
tube<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.220> half<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.850> look<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:37.110> would<00:03:37.230> be

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
tube in half and look at it it would be

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.130 
tube in half and look at it it would be
oval<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:38.640> should<00:03:38.910> also<00:03:39.060> be<00:03:39.210> noted<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:40.110> you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
oval it should also be noted that if you

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.930 
oval it should also be noted that if you
look<00:03:40.560> at<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.740> left<00:03:40.950> side<00:03:41.130> you'll<00:03:41.550> see

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
look at the left side you'll see

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.050 
look at the left side you'll see
but<00:03:42.170> 165<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.400> means<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> thicker

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
but 165 and so that means the thicker

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.040 
but 165 and so that means the thicker
metal<00:03:45.570> side<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.640> thick<00:03:47.940> for<00:03:48.210> 165

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
metal side it is thick for 165

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.910 
metal side it is thick for 165
millimeters<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.310> then<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.030> starts<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.360> taper

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
millimeters and then it starts to taper

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.050 
millimeters and then it starts to taper
for<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> hundred<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.670> eighty<00:03:53.820> four

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
for a hundred and eighty four

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.420 
for a hundred and eighty four
millimeters<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.870> then<00:03:55.800> on<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> right<00:03:56.250> it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
millimeters and then on the right it

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.360 
millimeters and then on the right it
says<00:03:56.460> Center<00:03:57.230> 102<00:03:58.230> millimeters<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
says Center 102 millimeters so the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.760 
says Center 102 millimeters so the
centre<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.150> actually<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.810> centre<00:04:01.410> in

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
centre is not actually the centre in

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:23.680 
centre is not actually the centre in
this<00:04:02.100> case

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.930 

so<00:04:24.690> last<00:04:24.930> week<00:04:25.170> when<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.830> was<00:04:25.890> showing<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.610> top

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
so last week when I was showing the top

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.130 
so last week when I was showing the top
down<00:04:27.210> view<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.200> chain<00:04:29.010> stays<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.990> back

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
down view of my chain stays on the back

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.260 
down view of my chain stays on the back
end<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.500> bike<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.850> trying<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.120> get<00:04:33.210> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
end of the bike I was trying to get a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.210 
end of the bike I was trying to get a
big<00:04:33.480> tire<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:33.750> there<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.680> only<00:04:34.800> way<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.040> do

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
big tire on there and the only way to do

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.300 
big tire on there and the only way to do
that<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.850> bend<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.270> chain<00:04:36.510> stays<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:38.010> in

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
that is to bend the chain stays so in

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.150 
that is to bend the chain stays so in
the<00:04:38.460> next<00:04:38.640> video<00:04:39.210> I'm<00:04:39.630> going<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.290> attempt<00:04:40.890> to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
the next video I'm going to attempt to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.850 
the next video I'm going to attempt to
build<00:04:42.120> because<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.780> have<00:04:42.990> no<00:04:43.140> way<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.320> bend<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
build because I have no way to bend the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.090 
build because I have no way to bend the
chain<00:04:44.100> stays<00:04:44.310> I'm<00:04:44.700> going<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.210> build<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:46.470> chain

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
