00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
kind of an an eyelet to catch it and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.490 
kind of an an eyelet to catch it and
I've<00:02:08.950> got<00:02:09.099> some<00:02:09.780> hardware<00:02:10.780> over<00:02:11.019> there<00:02:11.170> for

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
I've got some hardware over there for

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.240 
I've got some hardware over there for
actually<00:02:12.370> curtain<00:02:12.730> poles<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.650> lift<00:02:14.860> my<00:02:15.040> door

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
actually curtain poles to lift my door

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.369 
actually curtain poles to lift my door
the<00:02:15.670> door<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:15.910> made<00:02:16.120> out<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.599> cutting<00:02:17.110> board

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
the door is made out of a cutting board

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:27.650 
the door is made out of a cutting board
so<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:24.480> status<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.720> coop<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.140> now

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
so that's a status of the coop right now

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.770 
so that's a status of the coop right now
my<00:02:28.660> rows<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.940> go<00:02:30.940> outside<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:34.750> are

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
my rows one go outside but they are

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.530 
my rows one go outside but they are
starting<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.650> lay<00:02:35.830> eggs<00:02:36.330> too

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
starting to lay eggs too

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
starting to lay eggs too
so<00:02:37.810> that's<00:02:38.049> good<00:02:40.049> my<00:02:41.049> Leghorn<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.709> think<00:02:41.950> she

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
so that's good my Leghorn I think she

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.449 
so that's good my Leghorn I think she
might<00:02:42.610> lay<00:02:42.819> brown<00:02:43.269> eggs<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:45.010> know<00:02:45.130> she's

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
might lay brown eggs I don't know she's

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.990 
might lay brown eggs I don't know she's
a<00:02:45.670> true<00:02:46.380> Leghorn<00:02:47.380> or<00:02:47.560> if<00:02:47.650> they<00:02:47.829> lay<00:02:48.700> brown<00:02:48.940> eggs

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
a true Leghorn or if they lay brown eggs

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500 
a true Leghorn or if they lay brown eggs
but<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:50.079> getting<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.849> got<00:02:51.849> three<00:02:52.090> eggs<00:02:52.269> today

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
but I'm getting I got three eggs today

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.180 
but I'm getting I got three eggs today
so<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.200> think<00:02:53.410> they're<00:02:53.739> all<00:02:54.390> laying<00:02:55.390> now<00:02:56.190> pretty
