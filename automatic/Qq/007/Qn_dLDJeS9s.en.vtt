talk to you today a little bit about

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
talk to you today a little bit about
tuning<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> string<00:00:09.000> changing<00:00:09.600> the<00:00:09.750> first

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
tuning and string changing the first

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.120 
tuning and string changing the first
thing<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.260> want<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> show<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.099> to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
thing I want to show you is how to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
thing I want to show you is how to
change<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.639> string<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.719> it'll<00:00:12.900> stay<00:00:13.230> in

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
change a string so that it'll stay in

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.200 
change a string so that it'll stay in
tune<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.250> kind<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> goes<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:17.210> I'm

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
tune so it kind of goes like this I'm

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
tune so it kind of goes like this I'm
going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> use<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.779> low<00:00:18.960> E<00:00:19.199> string<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
going to use the low E string and in

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
going to use the low E string and in
this<00:00:20.730> case<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> through<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> body<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this case it's a through the body but it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
this case it's a through the body but it
doesn't<00:00:22.980> matter<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.820> through<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> body

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
doesn't matter if it's through the body

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.250 
doesn't matter if it's through the body
or<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.279> stop<00:00:26.279> tail<00:00:26.580> piece<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.119> whatever<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
or a stop tail piece or whatever just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.999 
or a stop tail piece or whatever just
make<00:00:28.920> sure<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.859> pull<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
make sure it's in there then pull the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.170 
make sure it's in there then pull the
string<00:00:32.040> straight<00:00:32.970> through<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.629> peg<00:00:34.970> so<00:00:35.970> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
string straight through the peg so that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
string straight through the peg so that
it's<00:00:36.330> straight<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> come<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's straight like this then I come to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.740 
it's straight like this then I come to
the<00:00:39.030> 12th<00:00:39.420> fret<00:00:39.659> and<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:41.150> pull<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.269> string<00:00:42.570> up

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the 12th fret and I pull the string up

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
the 12th fret and I pull the string up
with<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.110> tension<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.339> a<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.330> inch

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
with some tension with a about an inch

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
with some tension with a about an inch
and<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> half<00:00:46.019> something<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.220> now<00:00:47.460> what

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and a half something like that now what

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.460 
and a half something like that now what
I'm<00:00:47.790> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.269> if<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.170> peg

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
I'm going to do if you look at the peg

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.399 
I'm going to do if you look at the peg
is<00:00:49.799> I'm<00:00:50.549> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> feed<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.510> string<00:00:51.900> back

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
is I'm going to feed the string back

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.140 
is I'm going to feed the string back
under<00:00:52.860> itself<00:00:53.479> clockwise<00:00:54.479> watch<00:00:55.019> like<00:00:55.470> this

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
under itself clockwise watch like this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.689 
under itself clockwise watch like this
clockwise<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.839> then<00:00:58.500> grab<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.220> pull<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
clockwise and then grab it and pull it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.609 
clockwise and then grab it and pull it
nice<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.059> tight<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:00.930> feed<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.470> back

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
nice and tight and then feed it back

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.910 
nice and tight and then feed it back
again<00:01:02.269> counterclockwise<00:01:03.269> so<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> creates<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
again counterclockwise so it creates a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
again counterclockwise so it creates a
little<00:01:05.430> loop<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.920> then<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:09.080> tune<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
little loop there and then I tune the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.990 
little loop there and then I tune the
string<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:10.800> what<00:01:10.980> I'm<00:01:11.100> doing<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> turning<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
string now what I'm doing is turning the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.800 
string now what I'm doing is turning the
peg<00:01:12.270> again<00:01:13.130> counterclockwise<00:01:14.130> until<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
peg again counterclockwise until it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.460 
peg again counterclockwise until it
catches<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.950> loop<00:01:17.250> catches<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.660> now

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
catches that loop catches and then now

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.790 
catches that loop catches and then now
this<00:01:19.740> string<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.520> come<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.660> or<00:01:21.930> any<00:01:22.410> you

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
this string will not come out or any you

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.640 
this string will not come out or any you
know<00:01:22.920> it'll<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.730> won't<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.660> won't<00:01:24.810> give<00:01:25.140> or

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
know it'll it won't be won't give or

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.500 
know it'll it won't be won't give or
anything<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.820> about<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.330> is

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
anything and the good thing about it is

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.290 
anything and the good thing about it is
that<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:29.160> there's<00:01:29.550> not<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.760> lot<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:29.970> wraps

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
that because there's not a lot of wraps

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.960 
that because there's not a lot of wraps
I<00:01:30.660> can<00:01:31.320> tune<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> pretty<00:01:31.920> quickly<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.580> now<00:01:32.760> just

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I can tune it pretty quickly so now just

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.899 
I can tune it pretty quickly so now just
my<00:01:33.180> ear<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:37.010> grab<00:01:38.010> it<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
my ear I grab it like that and then I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.620 
my ear I grab it like that and then I
just<00:01:39.150> stretch<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.820> stretch<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.180> few<00:01:42.390> times

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
just stretch it stretch it a few times

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:57.190 
just stretch it stretch it a few times
like<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.830> then<00:01:49.670> I'll<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.940> clip<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.330> off

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.260 

okay<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.159> we've<00:01:58.460> looked<00:01:58.670> at<00:01:58.820> how<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> put<00:01:59.210> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
okay so we've looked at how to put a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.870 
okay so we've looked at how to put a
string<00:01:59.720> on<00:01:59.900> now<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.409> idea<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.430> try<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.640> get

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
string on now the idea is to try to get

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.820 
string on now the idea is to try to get
tuned<00:02:02.150> up<00:02:02.360> quickly<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.380> have<00:02:03.560> some

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
tuned up quickly so if you have some

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.219 
tuned up quickly so if you have some
sort<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.280> an<00:02:04.400> electronic<00:02:04.659> tuning<00:02:05.659> device<00:02:05.750> like

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
sort of an electronic tuning device like

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.169 
sort of an electronic tuning device like
I'm<00:02:06.380> sure<00:02:06.560> most<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.280> what<00:02:07.759> I<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:08.060> to

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
I'm sure most of you do what I like to

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.600 
I'm sure most of you do what I like to
do<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.599> try<00:02:08.630> not<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.050> use<00:02:09.280> anything<00:02:10.280> where<00:02:10.580> I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
do is I try not to use anything where I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.720 
do is I try not to use anything where I
have<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.940> actually<00:02:11.120> fret<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> string<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.130> mean

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
have to actually fret a string so I mean

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.110 
have to actually fret a string so I mean
Fred<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> note<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.440> idea<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.459> uh<00:02:16.610> I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
Fred a note so the idea here is uh I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120 
Fred a note so the idea here is uh I
think<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.780> twelfth<00:02:18.080> fret<00:02:18.170> harmonic<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
think the twelfth fret harmonic is the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.400 
think the twelfth fret harmonic is the
best<00:02:19.340> way<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.520> go<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> harmonic<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.780> real<00:02:21.110> pure

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
best way to go a harmonic is a real pure

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.070 
best way to go a harmonic is a real pure
tone<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:22.130> easy<00:02:22.520> for<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.060> tuner<00:02:23.660> to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
tone it's easy for that tuner to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.020 
tone it's easy for that tuner to
recognize<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.950> stuff<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.459> makes<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.819> very

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
recognize and stuff so it makes it very

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360 
recognize and stuff so it makes it very
easy<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.510> sort<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.440> quickly<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.190> we'll

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
easy to sort of go quickly so we'll

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.490 
easy to sort of go quickly so we'll
start<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.970> with<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.690> E<00:02:29.900> string<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
start with the with the E string the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
start with the with the E string the
high<00:02:30.650> E<00:02:30.680> string<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.310> work<00:02:31.430> our<00:02:31.610> way<00:02:31.760> down<00:02:31.790> so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
high E string and work our way down so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.170 
high E string and work our way down so
to<00:02:33.440> hit<00:02:33.590> our<00:02:33.739> harmonic<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.730> lay<00:02:35.150> your

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
to hit our harmonic you just lay your

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.710 
to hit our harmonic you just lay your
finger<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.959> string<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:37.670> hit<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
finger on the string and then hit the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.390 
finger on the string and then hit the
note<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.200> then<00:02:39.440> take<00:02:39.680> your<00:02:39.830> finger<00:02:40.040> off<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
note and then take your finger off it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.140 
note and then take your finger off it
doesn't<00:02:40.910> have<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.180> be<00:02:41.330> real<00:02:41.600> exact<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.970> then

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
doesn't have to be real exact but then

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.610 
doesn't have to be real exact but then
now<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.080> look

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.960 

at<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.950> tuner

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.820 

until<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.150> good<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:55.140> move<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> next

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
until it's good then move to the next

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.190 
until it's good then move to the next
one<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.580> recommend<00:02:57.210> is<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
one now what I recommend is that you

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
one now what I recommend is that you
never<00:02:58.410> tuned<00:02:58.800> down<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.610> new<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> note<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.240> get

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
never tuned down to new the note to get

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.930 
never tuned down to new the note to get
it<00:03:00.570> right<00:03:00.780> always<00:03:01.410> go<00:03:01.800> down<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.430> tune<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.880> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it right always go down and tune up to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.490 
it right always go down and tune up to
the<00:03:03.120> note<00:03:03.240> because<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.110> creating

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the note because then you're creating

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
the note because then you're creating
tension<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.880> more<00:03:06.120> likely<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
tension and it's more likely that the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.110 
tension and it's more likely that the
guitar<00:03:07.050> will<00:03:07.140> stay<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.500> tune<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.190> same<00:03:09.090> thing

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
guitar will stay in tune so same thing

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.540 
guitar will stay in tune so same thing
with<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> next<00:03:09.990> string<00:03:11.900> B<00:03:12.900> string<00:03:13.370> 12th<00:03:14.370> fret

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
with the next string B string 12th fret

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.080 
with the next string B string 12th fret
harmonic

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.900 

g-string

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
g-string

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.250 
g-string
12th<00:03:22.910> fret<00:03:23.060> harmonic

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.140 

d-string<00:03:26.260> look<00:03:26.799> pretty<00:03:27.040> good<00:03:27.250> leave<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.849> alone

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
d-string look pretty good leave it alone

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.819 
d-string look pretty good leave it alone
if<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.599> not<00:03:28.750> broke<00:03:29.049> don't<00:03:29.079> fix<00:03:29.379> it<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:31.829> string

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
if it's not broke don't fix it a string

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.790 
if it's not broke don't fix it a string
also<00:03:33.099> looks<00:03:33.459> pretty<00:03:33.730> good

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
also looks pretty good

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.290 
also looks pretty good
and<00:03:36.450> then<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:39.220> low<00:03:39.400> E<00:03:39.430> string<00:03:39.940> which<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.150> the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
and then the low E string which is the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.300 
and then the low E string which is the
string<00:03:40.630> we<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:40.930> put<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.560> let's<00:03:41.860> pull<00:03:42.130> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
string we just put on so let's pull that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300 
string we just put on so let's pull that
one<00:03:42.460> a<00:03:42.490> little<00:03:42.670> bit<00:03:42.910> again
