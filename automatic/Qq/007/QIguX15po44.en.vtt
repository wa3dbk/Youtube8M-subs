they've<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> broken<00:01:54.360> away<00:01:54.659> from<00:01:54.869> him<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
like the most important thing to them is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.670 
like the most important thing to them is

the light of the cosmos and there's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.270 
the light of the cosmos and there's
actually<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> pretty<00:02:26.350> cool<00:02:26.530> line<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.040> he<00:02:27.100> says

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
actually a pretty cool line that he says

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
actually a pretty cool line that he says
it<00:02:27.430> seems<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.760> important<00:02:28.510> he<00:02:29.290> says

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
it seems to be important he says

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620 
it seems to be important he says
specifically<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.670> which<00:02:30.910> will<00:02:31.210> see<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
specifically the which will see the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.230 
specifically the which will see the
light<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> cosmos<00:02:32.880> which<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.000> kind<00:02:34.210> of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
light of the cosmos which is kind of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.670 
light of the cosmos which is kind of
weird<00:02:34.420> because<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:34.990> he's<00:02:35.260> referring

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
weird because it's like he's referring

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.620 
weird because it's like he's referring
to<00:02:35.710> himself<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> third<00:02:36.490> person<00:02:36.670> which<00:02:37.420> is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
to himself in the third person which is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.230 
to himself in the third person which is
kind<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> strange<00:02:38.800> thing<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:40.000> they

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
kind of a strange thing to do but they

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.730 
kind of a strange thing to do but they
definitely<00:02:40.480> seem<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.870> be<00:02:40.930> after<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.350> Scarlet

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
because Scarlet Witch robbed us of our

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.140 
because Scarlet Witch robbed us of our
gifts<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.040> even<00:02:51.370> earlier<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> issue<00:02:51.940> they

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
gifts and even earlier in the issue they

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.060 
gifts and even earlier in the issue they
reference<00:02:52.480> her<00:02:52.570> saying<00:02:52.960> there<00:02:53.740> are<00:02:53.890> other

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
ways to convince her to aid us which I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.310 
ways to convince her to aid us which I
assume<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.790> Scarlet<00:02:58.210> Witch<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.690> know

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
assume is the Scarlet Witch you know

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.980 
assume is the Scarlet Witch you know
she's<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.710> one<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.070> most<00:03:00.130> powerful<00:03:00.990> not

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
she's like one of the most powerful not

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.720 
she's like one of the most powerful not
just<00:03:02.200> mutants<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.770> people<00:03:03.130> in<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> Marvel

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
just mutants but people in the Marvel

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.640 
just mutants but people in the Marvel
Universe<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:05.020> makes<00:03:05.200> sense<00:03:05.350> they<00:03:05.530> would

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
Universe so it makes sense they would

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.820 
Universe so it makes sense they would
target<00:03:05.920> her<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:07.840> not<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.260> her<00:03:08.560> that

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
target her and it's not just her that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.230 
target her and it's not just her that

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
on life the x-men seem to be kind of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.630 
on life the x-men seem to be kind of
pessimistic<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.680> Avengers<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.430> very

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
pessimistic the Avengers have a very

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.600 
pessimistic the Avengers have a very
optimistic<00:04:37.880> viewpoint<00:04:38.540> on<00:04:39.370> life<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.580> general

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
like a great quote where he's saying if

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.470 
like a great quote where he's saying if

these guys actually work together we
wouldn't<00:04:50.780> stand<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.110> chance<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:52.310> it's<00:04:52.820> like

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
wouldn't stand a chance so it's like

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.610 
wouldn't stand a chance so it's like
it's<00:04:53.180> all<00:04:53.300> about<00:04:53.450> unity<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:54.080> how<00:04:54.440> can<00:04:54.500> you

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.780 
it's all about unity and how can you
make<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.890> happen

make that happen

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.750 
make that happen
havoc<00:04:56.540> obviously<00:04:56.990> seems<00:04:57.230> to<00:04:57.410> be<00:04:57.530> he's<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.640> guy

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
havoc obviously seems to be he's the guy

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.090 
havoc obviously seems to be he's the guy
who's<00:04:58.940> like<00:04:59.030> pushing<00:04:59.480> for<00:04:59.630> unity<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.020> most<00:05:00.230> he

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
issue I find it kind of funny that when

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.370 
issue I find it kind of funny that when
push<00:05:05.270> comes<00:05:05.480> to<00:05:05.540> shove<00:05:05.780> he's<00:05:05.930> like<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.290> know

let's just go call Scott maybe he could
save<00:05:08.150> us<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:09.140> to<00:05:09.410> me<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.620> seems<00:05:09.770> like<00:05:09.890> one<00:05:10.220> of

years that says push here Captain

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
America and I'm thinking maybe it's

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.490 
America and I'm thinking maybe it's
probably<00:05:46.970> a<00:05:47.000> mortise<00:05:47.360> because<00:05:47.660> he<00:05:47.810> also<00:05:48.020> left

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
probably a mortise because he also left

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.960 
probably a mortise because he also left
the<00:05:48.680> previous<00:05:49.010> warning<00:05:49.370> about<00:05:49.490> watch<00:05:49.670> out<00:05:49.850> for

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
this onslaught return so I think he's

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.030 
this onslaught return so I think he's
you<00:05:53.030> know<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.360> trying<00:05:53.510> to<00:05:53.570> rent<00:05:53.810> all<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.200> it

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
could be that or it could be kang who

the<00:05:58.970> twins<00:05:59.240> are<00:05:59.390> now<00:05:59.480> seemed<00:05:59.720> to<00:05:59.780> be<00:05:59.930> working

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
the twins are now seemed to be working

the twins are now seemed to be working
against<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:00.860> so<00:06:01.460> maybe<00:06:01.670> he<00:06:01.880> wants<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.440> twins

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
against and so maybe he wants the twins

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.350 
against and so maybe he wants the twins
to<00:06:03.620> lose<00:06:03.800> because<00:06:04.130> he's<00:06:04.430> against<00:06:04.820> apocalypse

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360

that's something that was established
right<00:06:09.250> previously<00:06:10.250> so<00:06:10.850> maybe<00:06:11.840> he'll<00:06:12.140> work

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
right previously so maybe he'll work

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.700 
right previously so maybe he'll work
with<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.650> uncanny<00:06:12.980> Avengers<00:06:13.090> marginally<00:06:14.710> so
