00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.910
 for many 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 having a spectacular physique and being 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.549
 a kind of bodybuilder in the eyes of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.139
 those who see us on the beach on the street 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.139
 although we have never competed 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.869
 for many that is the important thing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.869
 look or be a bodybuilder 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.870
 but you're wrong 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.290
 that's not why you're going to be better people 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 do not do 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:45.120
 really balanced human beings 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.970
 with the ability to maintain that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 physical that you have achieved with 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.230
 effort but obviously in the long run 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 that stress to keep them going to happen 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.430
 bill 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 so dignified is he who trains regularly 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 to get a great physicist 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.360
 hypertrophied and compete like the one 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.970
 makes to be better of health to have 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 better physical appearance or simply 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.700
 be better mentally because 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.040
 training exercise sport 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.040
 it makes us more balanced 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 and less stressed important for 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.640
 our emotional level this balance 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.190
 emotional and for our health 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.900
 should not be underestimated nobody nobody 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.430
 because I enter a gym and there is a 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.420
 little stronger or much stronger than 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.909
 the rest is better person do not forget it 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.909
 if you do not see that 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.710
 you are going to fall into a deep well 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.460
 and go to be mean and the people of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 around you despise 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.780
 do not think I'm better than anyone 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.640
 accept an effort to demonstrate 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.250
 not people but yourselves 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 show you that you are better every day 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.700
 people 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.360
 to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.410
 do not
