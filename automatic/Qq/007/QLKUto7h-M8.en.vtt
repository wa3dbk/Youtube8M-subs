00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 own pedro j 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.100
 generally also those people who 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.230
 Mother does not even let or drink coffee because 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.850
 They say it hurts so the child has a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.460
 kind of cool people too that people 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.960
 Where are you going to take the photo? 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.430
 person does not just have to go there has to 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.290
 prove that she went there for everybody 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.540
 you know them, usually these are also 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.790
 the people who call the pub bar 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.500
 It seems cool to get out too. 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.550
 famous coffee shop just to take photo and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.440
 put on instagram 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.000
 I wanted to warn that coffee drinking pub 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 It's the same as you still take cafeteria 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.020
 famous the difference in the famous cafeteria 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.520
 You pay for the glass so you can take a picture. 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.780
 put on the instagram and then get that 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.490
 You do not even think people are going 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.560
 find it cooler because you pay more 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.840
 Expensive at the cafe but at the end same coffee 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.850
 I paid a little over $ 1 alan but there 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.190
 coffee is different you know coffee 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.420
 You know it's different, you can use this 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.980
 argument you have to be a person 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.300
 who studied about the coffee I have 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.140
 sure that you are not one of those 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.160
 people 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.170
 even because if you are a person 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.270
 intelligent enough to study the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.950
 history of coffee and the types of coffee 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.660
 I'm sure you will not 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.640
 be enough otto there just take it 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 cup photo people pretending like 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.170
 or do not like a band to look like 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.000
 cool but the worst is not even pretending like 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.260
 or do not like to pretend to know 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.730
 is in the middle of a lot of people are 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.960
 talking about something from a band of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.000
 Anything you're not 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.530
 understanding nothing is worth pretending 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.140
 understanding can only be that it is there in the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.640
 mean, stupid, you pretend 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.200
 You know something that you do not know. 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.180
 still runs the risk of being called 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.710
 power is much smarter on your part 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.109
 ask what you are talking about that 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.879
 you 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.349
 There talking shit now if you prefer. 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.110
 let no one know that you do not know 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.000
 that confusing subject you want 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.099
 let no one know that you do not know 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.719
 It's okay, you still have the right to 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.280
 be quiet then look over the 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.080
 subject in the next conversation you can 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.280
 to think more intelligently is more or 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.560
 less what happens with the dean of 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.569
 band without knowing a song of the band 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
 the person hears a refrain already says that it is 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.629
 Shit because everyone is talking 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.159
 What the hell is going on , I'm going to say nothing but the 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.379
 level already talked about that a lot of bands 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.849
 how the cure reflows everything I already 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.409
 I said that it was good I went to meet 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.639
 know that it really was bad 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.110
 at least for me have your opinion 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.520
 evidence people only say one thing 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.379
 bad or good 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.090
 go there and meet, and then you have the 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.860
 your own opinion whether the good thing or 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.020
 bad in your band, it's not just for 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.060
 any subject in your life is not 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.169
 maria-vai-com-as- otros does not help 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.340
 giving an opinion without having an argument 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.199
 for that 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.460
 the cdu account is not just talking badly just 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.110
 You'll have to explain why in your 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.430
 opinion here sucks for sure 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 You should also have known another type 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.909
 of legal people than those who act with 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.770
 you in a way as to closely 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.029
 other people is treated differently by 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.189
 example when the person is there only with 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.139
 You she, like, sponge bob, talk nonsense. 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.210
 of anything you live water together 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.560
 With you I saw that it would be more 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.509
 people are talking to you, you have 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.159
 more people automatically join the 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.300
 person becomes a johnny bravo is that 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.440
 kind of people who just want to impress 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.120
 sums up this kind of people who do something 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.310
 to be legal to take with the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.710
 others in fact she is not even so suffers 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.690
 some type of crisis of self-acceptance to 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.190
 own person does not accept himself as she is 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.080
 only you need to understand that it will not 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.729
 you try to be a person who 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.589
 You 're not no good, you want to. 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.089
 please everyone around you in the background 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.129
 You do not feel comfortable with yourself. 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.750
 Even you, even being friends with people. 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.279
 that people do not accept you 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.930
 accept why you are so temp 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.400
 explain why you are so you 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.020
 have these tastes because you like 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.969
 Why do not you like it because you like it? 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.439
 mark because you do not like now 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.789
 even though the person does not want to hear 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.770
 which distances that person with certainty 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.909
 Do not wanna be your real friend, I 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.759
 I'm sure that in your life you will not 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.710
 Needs stupid people, asshole and idiot. 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.539
 finally like things because you like 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.310
 not because others like to act like 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.020
 Do you think you should act like 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.279
 people think you should act
