00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
going to get it back at the same time

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
going to get it back at the same time
anyway<00:01:03.150> how<00:01:03.570> long<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> hold<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> out

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
anyway how long can you hold it out

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
anyway how long can you hold it out
there<00:01:04.559> slow<00:01:05.309> foes<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> still<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.299> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there slow foes and still get that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
there slow foes and still get that
damage<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.170> something<00:01:07.470> Lux<00:01:07.650> players<00:01:07.860> are

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
damage that's something Lux players are

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
damage that's something Lux players are
gonna<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.430> about<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> lot<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.450> has

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
gonna have to think about a lot this has

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
gonna have to think about a lot this has
a<00:01:09.659> couple<00:01:09.960> additional<00:01:10.170> considerations<00:01:11.040> as

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
a couple additional considerations as

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
a couple additional considerations as
well<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:12.000> example<00:01:12.420> CDR<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.650> better

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
well for example CDR is now way better

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.170 
well for example CDR is now way better
on<00:01:14.009> Lux<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:14.880> affects

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
on Lux because it actually affects

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
on Lux because it actually affects
lucent<00:01:15.780> singularity<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> meaningful<00:01:16.740> way

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
lucent singularity in a meaningful way

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.250 
lucent singularity in a meaningful way
however<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.420> DoubleTap<00:01:18.869> lucent

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
however if you just DoubleTap lucent

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.020 
however if you just DoubleTap lucent
singularity<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.010> will<00:01:20.190> see<00:01:20.370> an<00:01:20.460> overall<00:01:20.820> dps

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
singularity you will see an overall dps

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
singularity you will see an overall dps
decrease<00:01:21.900> based<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> longer<00:01:22.800> cool<00:01:23.010> down

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
decrease based on the longer cool down

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
decrease based on the longer cool down
but<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.030> predict<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.480> be<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.660> great<00:01:24.840> set

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
but we predict this will be a great set

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
but we predict this will be a great set
of<00:01:25.170> changes<00:01:25.410> for<00:01:25.530> Lux<00:01:25.830> players<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> really

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of changes for Lux players and really

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
of changes for Lux players and really
reward<00:01:27.000> skillful<00:01:27.480> play<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.350> also<00:01:28.530> took<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
reward skillful play we also took this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
reward skillful play we also took this
opportunity<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.460> add<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> couple<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:30.000> cool

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
opportunity to add a couple of cool

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.110 
opportunity to add a couple of cool
extra<00:01:30.840> thematic<00:01:31.320> utility<00:01:31.770> things<00:01:31.980> to<00:01:32.159> lux<00:01:32.400> for

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
extra thematic utility things to lux for

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.270 
extra thematic utility things to lux for
example<00:01:33.510> lucent<00:01:34.170> singularity<00:01:34.740> gives<00:01:34.920> vision

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
example lucent singularity gives vision

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
example lucent singularity gives vision

while it moves to the world and our
ultimate<00:01:36.930> also<00:01:37.230> gives<00:01:37.409> vision<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
ultimate also gives vision when you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.860 
ultimate also gives vision when you
shoot<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> off<00:01:38.370> this<00:01:39.030> gives<00:01:39.270> her<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.690> bit

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
shoot it off this gives her a little bit

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.720 
shoot it off this gives her a little bit
more<00:01:40.110> utility<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.430> run<00:01:41.580> that

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
more utility if you do want to run that

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.670 
more utility if you do want to run that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
bottom Lane kind of more cici utility

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.340
