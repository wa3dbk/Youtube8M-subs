rollover ability is by far the most

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380

potential to deal the most damage and is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
potential to deal the most damage and is
the<00:00:53.850> hardest<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> rebait<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:55.920> no

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the hardest to rebait if I has no

the hardest to rebait if I has no
ability<00:00:56.340> however<00:00:56.760> isn't<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.600> bad<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.170> least

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
ability however isn't that bad at least

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
ability however isn't that bad at least
if<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.890> fire<00:00:59.190> resistance<00:00:59.730> kept<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
if your fire resistance kept which you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.319

of course should be when mapping besides
that<00:01:03.539> he's<00:01:03.840> fairly<00:01:04.080> slow<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.860> easily

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that he's fairly slow and can be easily

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
that he's fairly slow and can be easily
