00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.310 
long and I think he felt coming here
that<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.460> would<00:01:58.580> be<00:01:58.700> his<00:01:58.880> best<00:01:59.090> shot<00:01:59.320> even

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
that it would be his best shot even

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.440 
that it would be his best shot even
though<00:02:00.440> he<00:02:00.590> was<00:02:00.740> injured<00:02:01.070> at<00:02:01.250> Charlotte<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
though he was injured at Charlotte and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.940 
though he was injured at Charlotte and
is<00:02:02.570> questionable<00:02:03.110> whether<00:02:03.260> he<00:02:03.620> would<00:02:03.740> be<00:02:03.890> able

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
is questionable whether he would be able

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.830 
is questionable whether he would be able
to<00:02:04.130> change<00:02:04.370> gears<00:02:04.729> ago<00:02:05.000> they<00:02:05.240> think<00:02:05.479> because

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
to change gears ago they think because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.859 
to change gears ago they think because
his<00:02:06.290> leg<00:02:06.590> was<00:02:06.830> injured<00:02:07.179> really<00:02:08.179> easier<00:02:08.540> on<00:02:08.720> it

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
his leg was injured really easier on it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.309 
his leg was injured really easier on it
