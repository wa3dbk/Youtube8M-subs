00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 once breaking news 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.559
 someday I'll have to bring it 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 just got the new skills of bap 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 reinbekommen diablo fans from the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 data mining what he's getting now 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.150
 have the last days and we had 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 now many changes and many new ones 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 things and we have also noticed 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.680
 there will be a level 70 we have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.590
 said there are mit reset smeton but 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.130
 that's not enough, they are 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.920
 most violent innovations especially us 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.450
 against us as bap players the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.550
 since the diablo 3 us appear 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 were presented 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 and I'm shocked in a way 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 I say honestly because it will be all 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.010
 There is no skill change 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.170
 or no changes to the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 skills that you have to see here 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.589
 but are the signed the skills 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 completely redone 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.960
 everything you see here in red or pink 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 is it all old and painted? 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 all that is green is new and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.340
 especially this applies to us 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.740
 use as whirlwind baba some 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.560
 will be happy now 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 but there I was like I said we have to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.939
 be careful 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 I'd say very briefly times few 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:40.350
 excerpts buffets goes away is totally crazy 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.560
 assarmaster gets from 10 to 5 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.570
 percent annoyed we have no bluetooth 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.579
 we do not have any more passive ones with us 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.549
 lively title rage 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.439
 the ultimate one 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.920
 the crucial thing is that we are angry 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.729
 gets annoyed in the fray 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.219
 that was the crucial skill 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.320
 whirlwind is thought must be seen 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.320
 is limited and yes 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.050
 and also many other changes 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.790
 I do not know what I'm really 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.420
 I have to say this honestly 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.390
 say that's violent I'll tell you right away 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 there is fierce but we must also may 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.300
 there I ask you that that is us 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 have to be careful 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 even if that's too shocking 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.550
 let himself and still so violently the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.950
 Changes are who knows what they are like 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.200
 play at the end of the first thing 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.610
 comes from it 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.850
 and secondly, how about the axes 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.680
 on the items yes not that it will 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.480
 the fixes that are deleted here 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.570
 can find later on our items 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 and thereby make our progress yes 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.540
 they also said that they want 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 more direction itunes go and less 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.860
 direction skills as they have meanwhile 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.620
 at the end here right now in diablo 3 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.540
 so that the skill is to decide 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 our state is an incredible one 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.380
 weight have such a big weight that 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.800
 we for the 100 million top ups 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.050
 can equip 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.890
 what I always do here when you do 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.670
 How can you for very little gold 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.190
 very horny babs tree and that will not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.800
 more likely if you go 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.620
 will be much more dependent on what 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.410
 For items you have and how these items 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.450
 behave to the skills though 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.340
 Overall, it's the biggest change for you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.850
 I have seen diablo 3 so far 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.709
 what we see now what is coming and 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.370
 great change and a lot of new 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.070
 that here concerns the playful 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.400
 that changes everything 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.100
 So yes, I'm shocked as I said 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.420
 I have to say it honestly and I know 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.800
 not really what they say 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.090
 because of course it can read it for yourself 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.240
 Also, I do not just believe her 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.489
 Read out how to get the ball off then 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.540
 plays at first sight and say that 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.280
 Honestly, if it's just about that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.880
 skills it looks after that the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.050
 Brand is deleted I say quite honestly 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.790
 but you have to be careful too 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.919
 We only have the information for now 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.340
 from now on you are the team hand there 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.650
 in it 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.680
 now they are from the one you look in there 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.509
 please the change to look at you 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.759
 please to what everything here is changed 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.300
 so we do not have them now they are all 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.330
 in it 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.560
 the change so what you see here 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.289
 By the way, we are here on the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.410
 new skills in it 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.449
 we do not have a change of the gel 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.520
 what you said but diablo 3 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.350
 will be completely redone completely honest 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520
 that you also see yourself here again 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.630
 between red and green 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.400
 that's a list of changes so there 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.810
 we already had them now 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.820
 all crusader skills all here you see 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.130
 the routes are not finished yet 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.580
 crusader and we now have the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.280
 the same number of skills as 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.139
 with the other classes 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.669
 but that's really hard and me 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.900
 Restrict me now really 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.530
 the paper could do it by itself 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.840
 read 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.320
 but that will be all new so diablo 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.139
 a new game for many is it like 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.090
 said for many it is beautiful but me 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.410
 personally a bit skeptical which 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:31.320
 I've often said that 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:34.530
 whirlwind baba from the gameplay forth 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.659
 for technical reasons or for technical reasons 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.690
 if you design it out of the game 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.300
 just looked awesome 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.150
 and blizzard's masterpiece is at 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.340
 everything bad at diablo 3 but 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.300
 that one also the skills of the pubs 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.360
 whirlwind bap can do as we do 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.099
 have played without blizzard it 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.650
 probably had planned 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.659
 that this is so symbiotic 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.180
 form 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:06.289
 that's awesome that's for me whole 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.289
 great art no longer 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.830
 what that makes a game but that 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.140
 is quite huge art for me always 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.090
 been there, I've always really 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.660
 big respect to blizzard 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.730
 paid 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.380
 now they are re-doing everything so it can 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.570
 also be that from these skills and 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:27.070
 from the new axes and 9 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:29.040
 paragon system blood system whole new yet 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.180
 arise for cool things 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.930
 That's why I want to be careful with 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.160
 a judgment 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.900
 but first I'm completely honest 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.160
 shocked that I say quite openly 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.520
 and we have to do that now in 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.040
 analyze calm that is a lot of new 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:51.160
 infos much more than really everything 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:54.370
 otherwise rebwood has shown so much 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.530
 I just wanted to say that to you briefly and 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.900
 share my emotions a bit 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.760
 you really that blatantly so that 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.550
 I have to swallow first 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.550
 honestly see you tomorrow at 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.830
 the hanta race does not get old with the 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.230
 Shield I say yes to hold the hand 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.180
 Team said he is very very very 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.060
 We'll do that now, too 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.900
 analyze tomorrow, I'm fine 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.900
 Until next time
