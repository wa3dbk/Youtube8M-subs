00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
that I have because it doesn't really

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.830 
that I have because it doesn't really
matter<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.430> want<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.030> maybe<00:03:15.450> four

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
matter you just want to have maybe four

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660

or<00:03:15.870> five<00:03:15.990> different<00:03:16.440> flowers<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:17.490> also

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
or five different flowers and I'm also

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000 
or five different flowers and I'm also
going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> use<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:19.080> little<00:03:19.110> butterfly<00:03:19.770> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
going to use just a little butterfly so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.170 
going to use just a little butterfly so
I<00:03:20.070> think<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:20.430> going<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.700> look<00:03:20.760> really

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
I think that's going to look really

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.670 
I think that's going to look really
pretty<00:03:21.330> too<00:03:23.390> now<00:03:24.390> unfortunately<00:03:25.200> all<00:03:25.380> these

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
pretty too now unfortunately all these

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.070 
pretty too now unfortunately all these
flowers<00:03:25.890> have<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.520> be<00:03:26.640> done<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.000> same<00:03:27.300> day<00:03:27.660> so
