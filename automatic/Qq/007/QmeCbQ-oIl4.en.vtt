morning is something I'm calling a Dixie
darter<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.160> darters<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:17.910> often<00:00:18.390> include

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
darter the darters which often include

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.840 
darter the darters which often include
fish<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.289> look<00:00:19.470> as<00:00:19.650> pretty<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.520> tropical

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
fish that look as pretty as tropical

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.009 
fish that look as pretty as tropical
fish<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:22.439> actually<00:00:23.570> purchased<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
fish are actually purchased there in the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
fish are actually purchased there in the
perch<00:00:25.260> family<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.980> may<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.519> size<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
perch family they may be the size and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
perch family they may be the size and
shape<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> minnows<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.230> they're<00:00:28.380> closely

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
shape of minnows but they're closely

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.700 
shape of minnows but they're closely
related<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> walleye<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> yellow<00:00:30.539> perch<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
related to walleye and yellow perch and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
related to walleye and yellow perch and
so<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> tie<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> Dixie<00:00:33.420> darter

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
so we're going to tie a Dixie darter

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.590 
so we're going to tie a Dixie darter
there<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.469> over<00:00:34.680> 200<00:00:35.219> species<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.790> darters

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
there are over 200 species of darters

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
there are over 200 species of darters
and<00:00:36.960> most<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and most of them are here in the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
and most of them are here in the
southeast<00:00:38.520> Tennessee<00:00:39.390> alone<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:40.290> 90<00:00:40.800> species

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
southeast Tennessee alone has 90 species

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.510 
southeast Tennessee alone has 90 species
so<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:42.989> lack<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.530> models<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so we have no lack of models that we can

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.690 
so we have no lack of models that we can

Darger's inhabit a variety of habitats

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.749 
Darger's inhabit a variety of habitats
but<00:01:56.780> they're<00:01:57.049> particularly<00:01:57.799> common<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.430> fast

flowing clear water streams and so you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.570 
flowing clear water streams and so you
need<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> little<00:02:03.350> bit<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.619> weight<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.310> what

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
need a little bit of weight that's what

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.639 
need a little bit of weight that's what

the tungsten bead is doing for us giving
us<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:06.979> weight<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.970> order<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.360> get<00:02:08.509> these

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.630 
more of the barbels than we have to
we<00:05:00.800> get<00:05:00.950> up<00:05:01.130> here<00:05:02.020> we'll<00:05:03.020> tie<00:05:03.350> off<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:06.640> copper

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
we get up here we'll tie off the copper

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.500 
we get up here we'll tie off the copper
wire<00:05:08.830> one<00:05:09.830> thing<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:10.250> learned<00:05:10.520> years<00:05:10.850> ago<00:05:11.270> and

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
wire one thing I learned years ago and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.540 
wire one thing I learned years ago and
that<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.690> you'd<00:05:12.170> never<00:05:12.440> want<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.830> cut<00:05:13.100> copper

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
that is you'd never want to cut copper

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.790 
that is you'd never want to cut copper
wire<00:05:13.760> with<00:05:14.060> scissors<00:05:14.600> or<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.810> wire<00:05:15.110> cutter<00:05:15.500> and

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
wire with scissors or a wire cutter and

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.080 
wire with scissors or a wire cutter and
the<00:05:16.700> reason<00:05:17.150> for<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.390> is<00:05:18.280> you<00:05:19.280> can<00:05:19.490> never<00:05:19.730> cut

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
the reason for that is you can never cut

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.030 
the reason for that is you can never cut
the<00:05:20.270> wire<00:05:20.480> close<00:05:20.900> enough<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.560> hook<00:05:21.740> shank

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
the wire close enough to the hook shank

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.130 
the wire close enough to the hook shank
that<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.760> don't<00:05:22.970> leave<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.210> little<00:05:23.540> burr<00:05:23.780> there

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
that you don't leave a little burr there

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.290 
that you don't leave a little burr there
if<00:05:24.230> you're<00:05:24.380> using<00:05:24.650> scissors<00:05:25.160> or<00:05:25.550> wire<00:05:25.730> cutters

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
if you're using scissors or wire cutters

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.720 
if you're using scissors or wire cutters
and<00:05:26.510> as<00:05:27.170> a<00:05:27.200> consequence<00:05:27.920> you've<00:05:28.190> got<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.430> point

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
and as a consequence you've got a point

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.690 
and as a consequence you've got a point
on<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.180> fly<00:05:29.420> that<00:05:29.660> could<00:05:29.810> easily<00:05:30.050> part<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:31.100> tip

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
on the fly that could easily part a tip

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.680 
on the fly that could easily part a tip
it<00:05:31.880> a<00:05:31.970> fine<00:05:32.240> tip<00:05:32.600> it<00:05:32.780> so<00:05:32.990> we<00:05:33.200> don't<00:05:33.380> want<00:05:33.620> that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
it a fine tip it so we don't want that

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.450 
it a fine tip it so we don't want that
we're<00:05:35.690> now<00:05:35.810> going<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.110> finish<00:05:36.590> off<00:05:36.920> our<00:05:37.190> fly
