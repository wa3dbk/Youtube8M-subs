00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.069 
on your car and track it around city
streets<00:01:53.970> because<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.750> you're<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.049> public

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
streets because if you're out in public

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
streets because if you're out in public
you<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.619> no<00:01:55.770> expectation<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.460> privacy<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you have no expectation of privacy but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.260 
you have no expectation of privacy but
nowadays<00:01:57.270> um<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> 1970s<00:01:59.969> nobody

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
nowadays um that in the 1970s nobody

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.319 
nowadays um that in the 1970s nobody
thought<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:00.930> carrying<00:02:01.409> iPhones<00:02:01.860> around

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
thought would be carrying iPhones around

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.319 
thought would be carrying iPhones around
and<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.450> iPads<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.680> mobile<00:02:05.329> connections

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and now iPads I have mobile connections

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.510 
and now iPads I have mobile connections
as<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> next

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
as well and so I think that in the next

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.800 
as well and so I think that in the next
few<00:02:08.700> years<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> Supreme<00:02:09.330> Court<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
few years the Supreme Court is going to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.690 
few years the Supreme Court is going to
revisit<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.440> say<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.979> because<00:02:11.610> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
revisit this and say actually because of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460 
revisit this and say actually because of
the<00:02:11.790> way<00:02:11.879> technology<00:02:12.150> has<00:02:12.569> changed<00:02:12.599> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the way technology has changed you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.600 
the way technology has changed you
now<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:13.830> expectation<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.460> privacy

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
now have this expectation of privacy

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.640 
now have this expectation of privacy
even<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.240> public<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> mention<00:02:16.560> the
