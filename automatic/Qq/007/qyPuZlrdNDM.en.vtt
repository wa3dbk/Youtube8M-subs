I<00:00:03.560> think<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.650> thing<00:00:04.680> I'm<00:00:04.950> anticipating<00:00:05.580> most

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
I think the thing I'm anticipating most

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.890 
I think the thing I'm anticipating most
in<00:00:06.799> 2013<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.150> just<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.240> see<00:00:09.389> where<00:00:09.599> monde

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
in 2013 is just to see where monde

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.049 
in 2013 is just to see where monde
rackers<00:00:10.290> forward<00:00:10.769> geometry<00:00:11.340> goes<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.880> been

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
rackers forward geometry goes it's been

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.120 
rackers forward geometry goes it's been
a<00:00:12.090> long<00:00:12.210> time<00:00:12.389> coming<00:00:12.599> i<00:00:13.170> mean<00:00:13.349> top<00:00:13.740> tubes<00:00:13.980> have

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
a long time coming i mean top tubes have

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.410 
a long time coming i mean top tubes have
been<00:00:14.219> getting<00:00:14.460> longer<00:00:14.670> stems<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.299> been

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
been getting longer stems have been

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
been getting longer stems have been
getting<00:00:15.660> shorter<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.770> sort<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.039> really

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
getting shorter but this sort of really

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.150 
getting shorter but this sort of really
jumps<00:00:18.090> ahead<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.740> idea<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
jumps ahead of all of that the idea of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.560 
jumps ahead of all of that the idea of
being<00:00:20.189> able<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> keep<00:00:20.699> ahead<00:00:20.880> angle<00:00:21.420> which

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
being able to keep ahead angle which

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.019 
being able to keep ahead angle which
isn't<00:00:21.869> ridiculously<00:00:22.470> slack<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.789> means

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
isn't ridiculously slack which means

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
isn't ridiculously slack which means
that<00:00:24.090> handling<00:00:24.600> still<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.289> nippy<00:00:25.590> through

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that handling still pretty nippy through

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.400 
that handling still pretty nippy through
the<00:00:25.980> trees<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:27.150> adding<00:00:27.359> extra<00:00:27.869> length<00:00:28.080> into

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the trees but adding extra length into

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
the trees but adding extra length into
the<00:00:28.650> top<00:00:28.890> tube<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> still<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.000> reach

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the top tube so you still got that reach

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
the top tube so you still got that reach
and<00:00:30.630> range<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.170> fast<00:00:31.619> handling<00:00:31.949> response

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and range and fast handling response

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.150

writable<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.259> longer<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> good<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
writable for longer it's a good thing so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.460 
writable for longer it's a good thing so
even<00:01:45.270> though<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.540> hero3<00:01:45.810> has<00:01:46.110> only<00:01:46.229> recently

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
even though the hero3 has only recently

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
even though the hero3 has only recently
come<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.189> we've<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.460> been<00:01:47.640> wowed<00:01:47.970> by

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
come out and we've all been wowed by

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569 
come out and we've all been wowed by
what<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.509> capable<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.799> 2013<00:01:50.369> I'm

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
what it's capable of so for 2013 I'm

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
what it's capable of so for 2013 I'm
probably<00:01:51.000> most<00:01:51.180> excited<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.810> their

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
probably most excited about their

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
probably most excited about their
successor<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> guess<00:01:53.310> you'd<00:01:53.670> call<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
successor to that I guess you'd call it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
successor to that I guess you'd call it
the<00:01:54.030> hero4<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> history<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> sort

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the hero4 go for have a history of sort

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
the hero4 go for have a history of sort
of<00:01:55.950> doubling<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:56.579> spec<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.240> each

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of doubling up their spec with each

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
of doubling up their spec with each
model<00:01:57.689> both<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.439> terms<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> frame<00:01:59.009> rates<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
model both in terms of frame rates and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.859 
model both in terms of frame rates and
resolutions<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.360> hoping<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
resolutions so we're hoping that the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
resolutions so we're hoping that the
hero4<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.130> potentially

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
hero4 would have something potentially

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.990 
hero4 would have something potentially
as<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.600> 240<00:02:04.259> frames<00:02:04.439> per<00:02:04.860> second<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.340> 720

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
as good as 240 frames per second at 720

as good as 240 frames per second at 720
HD<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> means<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.009> lot<00:02:08.190> more

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
