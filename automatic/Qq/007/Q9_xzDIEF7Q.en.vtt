00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.420
 welcome to pretty here to san 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.570
 valentine and our heart hairstyle 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.270
 pink are going to divide the hair in two and 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.210
 later they will start from behind 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.940
 forward making a match in 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.040
 semicircle as seen here trying to 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.560
 mark the semicircle as much as possible 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.780
 this will depend a lot on the growth 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.920
 of the hair the girl has or the 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.820
 person who are combing 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.340
 they will do the same on both sides and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.640
 with the remaining hair they are going to brush it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.040
 a little and hold it with a garter or with 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.130
 a clamp this to prevent us from 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.720
 hinders when we do the hairstyle and 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.600
 that the leagues have to be very 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.430
 stuck to the root and thus we avoid that the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 loose hair get tangled 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.610
 they will start taking small pieces 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.629
 of hair from back to front 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.110
 trying to always be the same 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.400
 amount and placing the elastics what 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.240
 more stuck to the root and tight 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.060
 possibly they will have to give many 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.490
 turns for this hairstyle you have to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 Use elastic roses of small 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.020
 or they can do it with red or with red and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 white as you prefer 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.179
 every time they take a new piece of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.000
 hair a halo with what you left over 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.070
 the previous ponytail and this procedure 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.039
 is going to be done up front when 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.900
 there is no hair left and it will surely be 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.030
 the height of the ear when they finish 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.390
 how the curve of the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 semicircle 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.479
 this hairstyle can do it for 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.670
 any type of hair that's why 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.940
 I am recommending it serves for hair 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.400
 smooth wavy Chinese and any kind of 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.960
 long since babies who have hair 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.960
 very short if you let yourself comb 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.050
 and even if they have layers the amount of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.190
 leagues that we are going to put hold all 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.190
 those layers of hair 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.530
 here we are at the end of the hair of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.980
 what we had loose and now we're going to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.780
 add 4 or 5 more elastics that are going 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.569
 to serve to form the tail of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.849
 heart 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.189
 if the hair is very short possibly 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.999
 they only need 3 but in the end they will 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.999
 measure one with another 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.500
 we are going to perform the same procedure 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.720
 on the left side and be careful of 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.000
 put the same amount of leagues for 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.569
 that the heart looks symmetrical you see 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.569
 uniform 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.450
 it is a hairstyle easy to do nothing more 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.270
 it takes a little bit of time to place 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.870
 the leagues but you'll see how good the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.870
 result 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.140
 here we finished on the left side 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.300
 and now we're going to release the hair that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.900
 we hold 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.610
 give him a brush to match it and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.910
 later they will take both 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.520
 extremes will measure if they already reach 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.730
 join in the center to see if it's not 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.010
 you need to add or remove links if you already 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.790
 is ready, they are going to join with a league 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.790
 of the same color 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.060
 and ready they managed to form a very beautiful 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.930
 heart that will look very much that apart 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.930
 It is full of color 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.329
 and that looks very cute in girls that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 have a happy valentine's day 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.049
 until next time
