 candy 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.200
 all so there I'm still doing a 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.160
 ramp 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 the idan echo it's for 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.230
 n for watch 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.000
 American so that I can trace for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.610
 to make the x roughly at 30 35 cm so 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.189
 it's a radius of 70 which is 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.009
 enough duel me I'm going to ask a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 wooden end I fixed well 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.980
 I drilled holes 8mm my m 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.489
 pencils is ready there is more than 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.800
 plot you have a radius for 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 perfectly identical to not you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 remove your pencils to trace your words 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.050
 cut that they are very frank 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.040
 after that gives this you assemble after 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 ag plywood 5mm voice 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.730
 exception of ten centimeters for 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.320
 to hold together next to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 other 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 louis is stuck all this to form a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 circle that will make a big one like that of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.369
 70 centimeters on five six laps there I 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.119
 am putting together funny 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.420
 so I traced the diameter of evil in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:29.180
 worse if for good to reposition god 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.180
 position us 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.360
 what she was doing 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:19.530
 it's over and that's fine here I finished my 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.070
 funny helix so now i'm going 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.880
 try it with trains we 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.880
 let's see what it would have done 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.970
 bread feast powers put my 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.340
 fabrics were on the inside because 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.630
 it rubbed with the big valley where 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.170
 jeremy just outside and that's 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.170
 enough in front 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.430
