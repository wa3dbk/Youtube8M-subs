00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:16.240
 things faithful clique first here 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:18.310
 Look here where you store it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.940

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.410
 So here it is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.440
 most important thing you expect here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.020
 fails 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.470
 in format war the video at quicktime 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.930
 film and look at the file where 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.930
 It saves that only after finds 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:07.760
 and then you click on it 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.290
 shut up with the orange 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.870
 background and then it starts too 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.940
 already on to others I already have that 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.370
 once made so do not bring much if 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.960
 I override that again because it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.010
 it takes a while to start 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.010
 to change that here now 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.750

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.580
 things as you can see how many pictures 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.860
 already changed 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:57.390
 So that means there are 261 individual 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:04:01.370
 pictures and 45 o'clock german time the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.850
 essential so it works and then 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.910

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.550
 does not matter which used because can you 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.250
