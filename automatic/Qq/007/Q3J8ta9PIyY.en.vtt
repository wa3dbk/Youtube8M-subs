00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.360
A unique collection of Italian Renaissance drawings by masters of their field, 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.000
such as Michelangelo, Raphael, Correggio and Titian, 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.000
not to forget anonymous masters of the 15th 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and less known artists of the 16th  century,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.380
such as Giulio Romano, Sebastiano del Piombo or Federico Zuccariis, 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.720
is among the greatest treasures of Frankfurt’s Städel Museum.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.040
A considerable part of these precious inventories stems from Friedrich Städel’s founding donation. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
His private collection included 4,000 drawings alone. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.000
In the mid-19th century, the outstanding arts connoisseur Johann David Passavant 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340
restructured and expanded the Städel collection by adding artworks of exceptional quality. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In the collection, we encounter fragile masterpieces, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
among them Michelangelo’s Grotesque Heads, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Raphael’s Design for the Disputa, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Titian’s extraordinary Study of St Sebastian

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Correggio’s Seated prophet with book.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Not only do the precious works of Italian draughtsmanship from the Städel Museum’s collection 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
show the individual drawing styles of the influential masters schools, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and the development of the forms of expression used by particular 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
but they also demonstrate the great diversity   

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.520
and the numerous functions and techniques that drawing had as a medium.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.140
A silverpoint study from 15th century, for example, 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.520
was based on a life model. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.000
The Genoese Luca Cambiaso used quill and brush 

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:48.000
for the final draft of his well-conceived composition comprising several figures. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
While the Venetian painter Jacopo Bassano created a drawing of almost abstract quality 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.420
which shows a reclining figure in different colored chalks. 

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:07.901
Here, he examined the interplay of colors and their spatial effect.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The drawings of this impressive era 

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:19.841
provide a unique stimulus for engaging with the thinking of major artists of the past.
