00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.940
 I have no desire to get a tattoo 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:15.260
 because i believe that man is 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:22.439
 man's karma has its own energy and 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 bir degil and in general the tattoo she carries 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.500
 in itself and a good bad sense of dates but 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.700
 when we lay our tattoo 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.800
 the pain is somewhere it hurts here is blood then she 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 bears immediately in itself negative 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 values even if you have written 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.800
 our love mom to or there aimak you something 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 for example or someone I do not remember how will 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.289
 shorter from the disk is not very embarrassing in general 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750
 overall this is a bad thing 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.180
 I would not plan for myself I do not plan to do 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.390
 the more you know the tattoo is already 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 mainstream is essentially every third 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 she is and it is not considered already 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.729
 feature feature already considered 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 people without tattoos actually know 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.430
 so a little bit strange looks when 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.710
 a man who looks solid 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 pretty, he raises his hand he 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 tattoo seems to me it is not very 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 aesthetically pleasing 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.720
 aesthetically well and of course on grandfathers and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 grandmothers are some kind of horror 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.020
 although although you know I 'm sorry that I do not 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.860
 I answer there are a lot of messages 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 but you are not interested just those 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.680
 although for 5 months I probably 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.909
 stuck to the thought that I wanted 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.780
 tattoo detail with 17 wanted to do 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.380
 something like 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.920
 on the wrist write a battle 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.110
 this one was such a dream
