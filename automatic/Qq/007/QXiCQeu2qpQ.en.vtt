okay<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.150> cocking<00:02:18.010> cut<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> way

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
okay got the cocking cut all the way

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.440 
okay got the cocking cut all the way
through<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:21.470> take<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> flat<00:02:22.040> bar<00:02:22.370> now<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
through they take a flat bar now and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.230 
through they take a flat bar now and
pull<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.560> baseboard<00:02:25.130> off<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.850> sure<00:02:26.060> you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
pull this baseboard off be sure you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.730 
pull this baseboard off be sure you
don't<00:02:26.390> take<00:02:27.430> it'll<00:02:28.430> take<00:02:28.580> your<00:02:28.700> flat<00:02:28.940> bar<00:02:29.300> and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
don't take it'll take your flat bar and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.470 
don't take it'll take your flat bar and
pry<00:02:30.740> against<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:34.490> sheet<00:02:35.060> whether<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.390> be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.449 
bar will go right through the wall
leaves<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.930> big<00:02:45.110> hole<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.040> got<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
leaves a big hole and then you got a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.180 
leaves a big hole and then you got a
mess<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.270> your<00:02:47.300> hands<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:49.040> we're<00:02:49.130> gonna

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
mess on your hands so what we're gonna

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.530 
mess on your hands so what we're gonna
try<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.610> what<00:02:49.820> we're<00:02:49.940> going<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.420> we're

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
try it what we're going to do is we're

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.479 
try it what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.720> attempt<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.170> get<00:02:52.040> under<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
going to attempt to get under the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.880 
going to attempt to get under the
baseboard<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.120> lift<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.510> up<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.750> little<00:02:53.900> bit<00:02:54.200> to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
baseboard and lift it up a little bit to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.710 
baseboard and lift it up a little bit to
kind<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.489> loosen<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.910> baseboard<00:02:56.330> from<00:02:56.600> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
kind of loosen the baseboard from the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.930 
kind of loosen the baseboard from the
wall<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.470> we're<00:02:57.560> gonna<00:02:57.650> slide<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.220> flat<00:02:58.640> bar

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
wall then we're gonna slide the flat bar

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.060 
wall then we're gonna slide the flat bar
down<00:02:59.180> between<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.320> baseboard<00:03:00.769> in<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> wall

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
down between the baseboard in the wall

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.850 
down between the baseboard in the wall
and<00:03:01.340> pull<00:03:01.700> out<00:03:02.030> carefully<00:03:02.900> slowly<00:03:03.200> loosening

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
and pull out carefully slowly loosening

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.370 
and pull out carefully slowly loosening
that<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.209> don't<00:03:05.239> break<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.750> base<00:03:05.989> and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
that up so we don't break the base and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.100 
that up so we don't break the base and
also<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.580> we<00:03:07.820> don't<00:03:07.940> damage<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.450> plaster

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
also so that we don't damage the plaster

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.320 
also so that we don't damage the plaster
we'll<00:03:09.709> do<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.489> drill<00:03:10.730> holes<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
we'll do that then we can drill holes to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:47.970 
we'll do that then we can drill holes to
put<00:03:11.780> our<00:03:11.870> octave<00:03:12.200> dry<00:03:12.350> unit<00:03:12.530> on

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.620 

ok<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.160> got<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.520> baseboard<00:03:50.030> off<00:03:50.210> over<00:03:50.510> here

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
ok so I got the baseboard off over here

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.260 
ok so I got the baseboard off over here
in<00:03:50.750> her<00:03:50.840> plaster<00:03:51.350> wall<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.920> I've<00:03:52.880> got<00:03:53.060> this

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
in her plaster wall and I've got this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.210 
in her plaster wall and I've got this
octave<00:03:53.720> dry<00:03:53.870> unit<00:03:54.080> laid<00:03:54.410> out<00:03:54.620> now<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> nice

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
octave dry unit laid out now the nice

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.740 
octave dry unit laid out now the nice
thing<00:03:55.400> about<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.730> octave<00:03:56.120> dry<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.330> its

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
thing about the octave dry is its

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.530 
thing about the octave dry is its
ability<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.290> move<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.980> lot<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.250> airflow<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
ability to move a lot of airflow the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.230 
ability to move a lot of airflow the
size<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.250> tube<00:04:01.490> that<00:04:01.730> goes<00:04:01.790> into<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
size of the the tube that goes into the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.490 
size of the the tube that goes into the
wall<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.570> going<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.810> determine<00:04:03.080> how<00:04:03.290> much

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
wall is going to determine how much

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.080 
wall is going to determine how much
airflow<00:04:03.980> we<00:04:04.130> can<00:04:04.250> get<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.520> there<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.910> off

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
airflow we can get in there in that off

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.030 
airflow we can get in there in that off
to<00:04:05.210> dry<00:04:05.390> yeah<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.960> has<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> big<00:04:06.440> tube<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.980> you

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
to dry yeah it has a big tube and you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.100 
to dry yeah it has a big tube and you
say<00:04:07.220> well<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.750> put<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> big

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
say well it's a you have to put a big

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.050 
say well it's a you have to put a big
hole<00:04:09.320> in<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.470> wall<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.860> get<00:04:10.310> airflow<00:04:10.490> in<00:04:10.880> there

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
hole in the wall to get airflow in there

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.190 
hole in the wall to get airflow in there
but<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:13.270> you<00:04:14.270> there's<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> trade-off<00:04:14.870> the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
but the you there's a trade-off the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.590 
but the you there's a trade-off the
smaller<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.830> hole<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.580> you<00:04:16.640> drill<00:04:17.390> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
smaller the hole that you drill the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.940 
smaller the hole that you drill the
small<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.049> less<00:04:18.200> airflow<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.709> you're<00:04:18.830> going

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
small the less airflow that you're going

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.770 
small the less airflow that you're going
to<00:04:18.980> put<00:04:19.130> into<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.370> wall<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.270> we're<00:04:20.600> going<00:04:20.720> to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
to put into the wall so we're going to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.720 
to put into the wall so we're going to
use<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.080> octave<00:04:21.260> dry<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.709> octave<00:04:22.400> dry<00:04:22.550> has

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
use the octave dry this octave dry has

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.280 
use the octave dry this octave dry has
been<00:04:22.970> specially<00:04:23.450> designed<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.870> hook<00:04:23.990> right<00:04:24.140> up

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.930 
able to inject a hot dry air flow right
into<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.320> wall<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.190> that's<00:04:37.490> gonna<00:04:37.700> give<00:04:37.880> us

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
into that wall and that's gonna give us

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.780 
into that wall and that's gonna give us
the<00:04:38.060> best<00:04:38.650> opportunity<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:40.340> get<00:04:40.430> this<00:04:40.580> wall

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the best opportunity to get this wall

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.360 
the best opportunity to get this wall
dry<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:42.200> other<00:04:42.380> thing<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.740> have<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.220> make

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
dry so the other thing I have to make

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.710 
dry so the other thing I have to make
sure<00:04:43.550> when<00:04:43.760> you're<00:04:43.880> laying<00:04:44.090> out<00:04:44.240> an<00:04:44.360> octave

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720

for drawing the interstitial cavities

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.520 
for drawing the interstitial cavities
you<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.960> make<00:04:51.110> sure<00:04:51.140> that<00:04:51.260> you're

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
you have to make sure that you're

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.160 
you have to make sure that you're
getting<00:04:51.740> in<00:04:52.240> air<00:04:53.240> flow<00:04:53.540> into<00:04:53.690> each<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:54.020> of<00:04:54.110> the

getting in air flow into each one of the
cavities<00:04:54.590> that's<00:04:54.800> wet<00:04:55.010> now<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.280> can<00:04:55.430> do<00:04:55.490> this

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
cavities that's wet now you can do this

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.430 
cavities that's wet now you can do this
a<00:04:55.700> number<00:04:55.940> of<00:04:56.030> different<00:04:56.300> ways<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:57.080> can<00:04:57.200> get<00:04:57.380> a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
a number of different ways you can get a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.560 
a number of different ways you can get a
use<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:57.920> stud<00:04:58.250> finder<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.940> find<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.330> studs

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
use a stud finder and find the studs

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.090 
use a stud finder and find the studs
that<00:04:59.690> are<00:04:59.780> in<00:04:59.900> the<00:04:59.960> wall<00:05:00.140> or<00:05:00.740> if<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.890> have<00:05:00.980> an

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
that are in the wall or if you have an

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.130 
that are in the wall or if you have an
IR<00:05:01.310> camera<00:05:01.340> which<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.270> what<00:05:02.450> we<00:05:02.600> did<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.990> just

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
IR camera which is what we did you just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.480 
IR camera which is what we did you just
take<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.320> our<00:05:03.560> camera<00:05:03.920> and<00:05:04.010> you<00:05:04.070> look<00:05:04.220> at<00:05:04.400> the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
take that our camera and you look at the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.680 
take that our camera and you look at the
wall<00:05:04.670> and<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:04.910> can<00:05:05.030> see<00:05:05.180> every<00:05:05.420> one<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.630> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
wall and you can see every one of the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.050 
wall and you can see every one of the
Cowie<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.320> if<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.920> have<00:05:07.100> an<00:05:07.370> IR<00:05:07.610> camera<00:05:07.640> you

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
Cowie so if you have an IR camera you

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.730 
Cowie so if you have an IR camera you
can<00:05:08.210> use<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:08.690> way<00:05:08.930> otherwise<00:05:09.260> it's<00:05:09.590> a

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
can use it that way otherwise it's a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.920 
can use it that way otherwise it's a
pretty<00:05:09.950> expensive<00:05:10.280> stud<00:05:10.670> finder<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.780> just

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
pretty expensive stud finder but it just

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.630 
pretty expensive stud finder but it just
has<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> lot<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.350> different<00:05:12.560> uses<00:05:13.070> for<00:05:13.100> us<00:05:13.430> in

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
has a lot of different uses for us in

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.580 
has a lot of different uses for us in
the<00:05:13.760> drying<00:05:14.030> environment<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.290> I'm<00:05:15.350> gonna<00:05:15.440> go

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
the drying environment so I'm gonna go

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.470 
the drying environment so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:15.830> drill<00:05:16.010> this<00:05:16.160> hole<00:05:16.220> over<00:05:16.820> here<00:05:17.390> in

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
ahead and drill this hole over here in

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.090 
ahead and drill this hole over here in
the<00:05:17.540> first<00:05:17.750> cavity<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.560> want<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.800> make<00:05:18.919> sure

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
the first cavity you want to make sure

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.920 
the first cavity you want to make sure
that<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.550> sill<00:05:20.090> plates<00:05:20.360> an<00:05:20.570> inch<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.900> half

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
that the sill plates an inch and a half

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.840 
that the sill plates an inch and a half
tall<00:05:21.290> so<00:05:21.530> get<00:05:21.890> up<00:05:22.040> at<00:05:22.220> least<00:05:22.400> an<00:05:22.550> inch<00:05:22.700> and<00:05:22.820> a

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
tall so get up at least an inch and a

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.520 
tall so get up at least an inch and a
half<00:05:22.880> but<00:05:23.300> keep<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:23.600> below<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.080> level<00:05:24.410> of

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
half but keep it below the level of

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.310 
half but keep it below the level of
baseboard<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.520> easy<00:05:25.700> it's<00:05:26.360> an<00:05:26.480> easy<00:05:26.630> fix<00:05:27.020> and

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
baseboard and easy it's an easy fix and

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.900 
baseboard and easy it's an easy fix and
also<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.250> have<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.400> remember<00:05:28.460> when<00:05:28.760> you're

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
also you have to remember when you're

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.340 
also you have to remember when you're
drilling<00:05:29.120> into<00:05:29.450> plaster<00:05:29.930> you're<00:05:30.050> gonna<00:05:30.140> get<00:05:30.290> a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
drilling into plaster you're gonna get a

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.720 
drilling into plaster you're gonna get a
little<00:05:30.560> chipping<00:05:30.980> around<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.280> edge<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.640> the

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
little chipping around the edge of the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.630 
little chipping around the edge of the
drill<00:05:31.970> bit<00:05:32.600> hole<00:05:33.020> so<00:05:33.169> drop<00:05:33.380> down<00:05:33.620> below<00:05:34.400> the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
drill bit hole so drop down below the

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.460 
drill bit hole so drop down below the
level<00:05:34.669> of<00:05:35.090> baseboard<00:05:35.540> just<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.900> little<00:05:36.169> bit<00:05:36.320> so

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
level of baseboard just a little bit so

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.960 
level of baseboard just a little bit so
that<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.620> don't<00:05:36.830> chip<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.220> plaster<00:05:37.700> that'll

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
that you don't chip the plaster that'll

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.909 
that you don't chip the plaster that'll
be<00:05:38.090> showing<00:05:38.630> above<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.990> trim

evaporation<00:06:41.000> there<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:42.639> we'll<00:06:43.639> dry<00:06:43.850> those

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
evaporation there and we'll dry those

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.969 
evaporation there and we'll dry those
walls<00:06:44.270> out<00:06:44.540> now<00:06:45.669> this<00:06:46.669> is<00:06:46.880> an<00:06:47.030> e<00:06:47.150> test<00:06:47.479> and<00:06:47.979> the

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
walls out now this is an e test and the

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.620 
walls out now this is an e test and the
e<00:06:49.010> test<00:06:49.370> requires<00:06:49.790> a<00:06:49.910> certain<00:06:50.240> amount<00:06:50.330> of<00:06:50.449> air

e test requires a certain amount of air

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.140 
e test requires a certain amount of air
flow<00:06:50.930> through<00:06:51.169> it<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.710> turn<00:06:51.919> on<00:06:52.000> so<00:06:53.000> if<00:06:53.090> you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
flow through it to turn on so if you

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.060 
flow through it to turn on so if you

and you'll hear it when it comes on

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.960 
and you'll hear it when it comes on
leave<00:07:09.770> that<00:07:10.010> octave<00:07:10.370> dry<00:07:10.520> unit<00:07:10.699> like<00:07:10.940> that

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
leave that octave dry unit like that

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.240 
leave that octave dry unit like that
that'll<00:07:11.449> be<00:07:11.570> air<00:07:11.810> escaping<00:07:12.260> escaping<00:07:12.590> out<00:07:13.130> at

the end of the octave dry that's

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.529 
the end of the octave dry that's
perfectly<00:07:15.110> fine<00:07:15.440> because<00:07:16.130> only<00:07:16.610> it<00:07:17.360> won't

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
perfectly fine because only it won't

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.300 
perfectly fine because only it won't
limit<00:07:18.169> the<00:07:18.260> amount<00:07:18.470> of<00:07:18.620> air<00:07:18.949> that's<00:07:18.979> being

limit the amount of air that's being
blown<00:07:19.850> into<00:07:20.090> the<00:07:20.180> walls<00:07:20.449> you<00:07:21.110> can<00:07:21.229> only<00:07:21.350> get<00:07:21.500> so

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
blown into the walls you can only get so

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.300 
blown into the walls you can only get so
much<00:07:21.919> air<00:07:22.160> through<00:07:22.400> those<00:07:22.580> tubes<00:07:23.110> so<00:07:24.310> just

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
much air through those tubes so just

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.860 
much air through those tubes so just
open<00:07:25.580> up<00:07:25.669> the<00:07:25.820> end<00:07:25.970> of<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.270> octave<00:07:26.720> dry<00:07:26.840> a

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
open up the end of the octave dry a

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.170 
open up the end of the octave dry a
little<00:07:27.020> bit<00:07:27.169> get<00:07:27.410> retested<00:07:28.070> turn<00:07:28.400> on<00:07:28.580> and

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
little bit get retested turn on and

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.659 
little bit get retested turn on and
we'll<00:07:29.479> easily<00:07:29.750> get<00:07:30.289> a<00:07:30.320> 30<00:07:30.680> to<00:07:30.830> 40<00:07:30.860> degree<00:07:31.400> heat

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669 
we'll easily get a 30 to 40 degree heat

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.150 
we'll easily get a 30 to 40 degree heat
rise<00:07:32.020> on<00:07:33.020> the<00:07:33.080> air<00:07:33.289> that's<00:07:33.440> coming<00:07:33.590> out<00:07:33.949> of

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 
rise on the air that's coming out of

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.339 
rise on the air that's coming out of
that<00:07:34.340> those<00:07:35.120> octave<00:07:35.510> drive<00:07:35.660> to<00:07:35.870> seeing<00:07:36.200> gets

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:36.349 
that those octave drive to seeing gets

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:38.740 
that those octave drive to seeing gets
them<00:07:36.440> into<00:07:36.620> pretty<00:07:36.950> high<00:07:37.729> temperatures<00:07:38.360> back

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
them into pretty high temperatures back

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.469 
them into pretty high temperatures back
inside<00:07:39.169> the<00:07:39.349> walls<00:07:39.590> to<00:07:39.919> create<00:07:40.669> evaporation

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 
inside the walls to create evaporation

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.839 
inside the walls to create evaporation
so<00:07:42.260> this<00:07:42.380> is<00:07:42.560> uh<00:07:42.590> this<00:07:43.160> is<00:07:43.280> what<00:07:43.430> we'll<00:07:43.550> do<00:07:43.669> with

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:43.849 
so this is uh this is what we'll do with

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.000 
so this is uh this is what we'll do with
plaster<00:07:44.210> walls<00:07:44.389> and<00:07:44.780> don't<00:07:45.080> expect<00:07:45.440> plaster

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.010 
plaster walls and don't expect plaster

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.029 
plaster walls and don't expect plaster
walls<00:07:46.190> to<00:07:46.400> dry<00:07:46.610> out<00:07:46.789> in<00:07:47.090> a<00:07:47.510> day<00:07:47.690> or<00:07:47.720> two<00:07:48.050> it<00:07:48.260> very

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 
walls to dry out in a day or two it very

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.560 
walls to dry out in a day or two it very
easily<00:07:49.370> depending<00:07:49.880> on<00:07:49.970> how<00:07:50.120> long<00:07:50.300> it's<00:07:50.479> been

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570 
easily depending on how long it's been

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.990 
easily depending on how long it's been
wet<00:07:50.900> and<00:07:51.260> what<00:07:51.950> type<00:07:52.130> of<00:07:52.160> construction<00:07:52.580> you

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 
wet and what type of construction you

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.890 
wet and what type of construction you
have<00:07:53.030> there<00:07:53.479> it<00:07:53.570> could<00:07:53.690> very<00:07:53.870> easily<00:07:53.960> take

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:55.900 
have there it could very easily take

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.839 
have there it could very easily take
many<00:07:56.900> days<00:07:57.169> to<00:07:57.470> get<00:07:57.560> that<00:07:57.740> completely<00:07:58.280> dry<00:07:58.550> so

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:58.849 
many days to get that completely dry so

00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:00.640 
many days to get that completely dry so
don't<00:07:59.090> feel<00:07:59.900> like<00:08:00.050> you're<00:08:00.199> not<00:08:00.289> doing<00:08:00.560> the

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:00.650 
don't feel like you're not doing the

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.900 
don't feel like you're not doing the
right<00:08:00.680> thing<00:08:01.039> just<00:08:01.280> make<00:08:01.430> sure<00:08:01.580> that<00:08:01.760> you

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:01.910 
right thing just make sure that you

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.310 
right thing just make sure that you
monitor<00:08:02.120> the<00:08:02.960> progress<00:08:03.190> monitor<00:08:04.190> monitor<00:08:04.849> the
