talking
I've<00:01:20.220> already<00:01:20.369> pressed<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.030> 10<00:01:21.270> times

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
I've already pressed it like 10 times

that's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> first<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> gotta<00:01:24.840> know

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's the first thing you gotta know

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
that's the first thing you gotta know
because<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.650> an<00:01:25.799> educational

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
because this is just an educational

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520 
because this is just an educational
process<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.240> still<00:01:27.509> pressing<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.290> wall

on<00:01:28.650> Clark<00:01:28.860> okay<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.909> reason<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.479> don't

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
on Clark okay the reason that we don't

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
on Clark okay the reason that we don't
use<00:01:30.930> pages<00:01:31.290> exclusively<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.579> can't<00:01:32.850> go

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
use pages exclusively is you can't go

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
use pages exclusively is you can't go
higher<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.780> lower<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
higher or lower it would be like it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210 
higher or lower it would be like it
would<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.850> buying<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.020> leash<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:38.040> the
