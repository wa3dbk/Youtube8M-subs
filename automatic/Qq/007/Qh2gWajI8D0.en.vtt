00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hello so I bought this RC 305 receiver

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.700 
hello so I bought this RC 305 receiver
and<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.279> matching<00:00:05.819> transmitter<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.710> they

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
and this matching transmitter and they

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.900 
and this matching transmitter and they
seem<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.250> not<00:00:08.400> working<00:00:10.280> let<00:00:11.280> me<00:00:11.460> wire<00:00:11.700> them

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
seem to be not working let me wire them

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.010 
seem to be not working let me wire them
up<00:00:12.799> first<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> power<00:00:15.599> cable

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
up first of all this is the power cable

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.240 
up first of all this is the power cable
and<00:00:17.090> this<00:00:18.090> camera<00:00:18.449> by<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> way<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.529> don't<00:00:20.010> know

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and this camera by the way I don't know

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
and this camera by the way I don't know
the<00:00:20.670> product<00:00:21.000> ID<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.750> putz<00:00:21.960> I'll<00:00:22.199> post

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the product ID for that putz I'll post

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.029 
the product ID for that putz I'll post
it<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.949> comments<00:00:23.490> or<00:00:24.199> someone<00:00:25.199> else<00:00:25.289> I'll

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it in the comments or someone else I'll

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
it in the comments or someone else I'll
put<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> product<00:00:27.300> IDs<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> links<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
put all the product IDs and links so the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
put all the product IDs and links so the
wiring<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.349> simple<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.790> looks<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.329> bit

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
wiring is simple it looks a bit

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.979 
wiring is simple it looks a bit
complicated<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.989> this

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
complicated but it's not actually this

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.910 
complicated but it's not actually this
is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> jack<00:00:37.530> goes<00:00:37.950> into<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> transmitters

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
is the jack goes into the transmitters

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
is the jack goes into the transmitters
the<00:00:40.920> whites<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.170> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the whites it is it's like now I to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
the whites it is it's like now I to
white<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.649> green<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> hour<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
white and green are the hour for the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
white and green are the hour for the
microphone<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> didn't<00:00:49.649> touch<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.129> they

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
microphone so I didn't touch them they

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.720 
microphone so I didn't touch them they
are<00:00:51.020> blue<00:00:52.250> like<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.559> there's<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.370> short

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
are blue like that and there's no short

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.840 
are blue like that and there's no short
shorts<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> way<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.829> yellow<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.309> goes<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
shorts by the way the yellow one goes to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.039 
shorts by the way the yellow one goes to
the<00:01:00.090> white<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> comma<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.870> red

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the white one to the comma and the red

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
the white one to the comma and the red
threads<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> ground<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.790> ground<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> let

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
threads and the ground is ground so let

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.780 
threads and the ground is ground so let
me<00:01:08.430> wire<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.260> i'll<00:01:10.950> show<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:16.340> i'm<00:01:17.340> using

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
me wire them and i'll show you i'm using

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.010 
me wire them and i'll show you i'm using
a<00:01:18.049> 3s<00:01:19.049> lipo<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> transmitters<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:24.020> 6

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a 3s lipo for the transmitters and 6

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
a 3s lipo for the transmitters and 6
volts<00:01:25.939> DC<00:01:26.960> from<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.640> for<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> receivers<00:01:31.790> by

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
volts DC from there for the receivers by

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.109 
volts DC from there for the receivers by
the<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.150> receiver<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> 5<00:01:34.079> volts<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> i'm

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the way my receiver is 5 volts but i'm

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.020 
the way my receiver is 5 volts but i'm
using<00:01:36.420> 6<00:01:36.659> volts<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.530> probably<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:38.460> fine<00:01:38.790> i

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
using 6 volts which probably be fine i

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.450 
using 6 volts which probably be fine i
think

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.219 

come<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:48.159> now<00:01:49.210> for<00:01:50.210> montage<00:01:50.659> i'm<00:01:51.020> actually

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
come on now for montage i'm actually

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.090 
come on now for montage i'm actually
using<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.770> TV<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.630> LG<00:01:53.630> one<00:01:53.810> which<00:01:54.560> says<00:01:54.770> no

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100

signal right now cuz I do not hook em

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.770 
signal right now cuz I do not hook em
now<00:01:59.630> this<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.729> coaxial<00:02:01.729> cable<00:02:02.180> goes<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
now this is the coaxial cable goes to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.080 
now this is the coaxial cable goes to
the<00:02:02.869> TV<00:02:08.140> okay<00:02:09.140> right<00:02:09.649> now<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.860> hope<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.550> receiver

still<00:02:19.519> no<00:02:19.700> signal<00:02:19.880> let's<00:02:20.890> power<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
still no signal let's power this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.330 
still no signal let's power this
receiver<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:26.180> it's<00:02:27.459> hope<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> camera<00:02:29.269> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
receiver now it's hope to the camera and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:49.059 
receiver now it's hope to the camera and
let<00:02:31.340> me<00:02:31.519> pause<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:46.239> hoped<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.620> lightest

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
let me pause I hoped it's the lightest

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.460 
let me pause I hoped it's the lightest
weight<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.829> folders<00:02:51.829> here<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.820> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
weight and folders here it's on to and I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.440 
weight and folders here it's on to and I
can<00:02:57.470> see<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.799> lights<00:02:58.070> but<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.640> don't<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.239> I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
can see in lights but I don't think I

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
can see in lights but I don't think I
should<00:02:59.480> be<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:02.090> TV<00:03:02.480> still<00:03:02.900> says<00:03:03.440> no

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
should be and the TV still says no

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.009 
should be and the TV still says no
single<00:03:04.340> no<00:03:04.940> signal<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.799> try<00:03:07.609> to<00:03:07.640> mess<00:03:08.420> with<00:03:08.660> the

single no signal I try to mess with the
channels<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:10.070> there<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.880> there<00:03:12.640> sometimes

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
channels right there in there sometimes

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.750 
channels right there in there sometimes
I<00:03:14.239> get<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.640> well<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:17.630> is<00:03:17.810> no<00:03:17.989> signal<00:03:18.760> sign

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760
