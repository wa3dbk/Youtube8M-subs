 skillfully take weight so as not to hurt 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.899

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.940
 can not bend after what we 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.030
 start performing squats with a bit 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.640

 big enough working weight to make you 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.579
 didn't fall back 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.010
 because if you won't get up in 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.140
 heels leaning back will not work 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.140

 else did it principle i isolate 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.830
 insulated isolation option 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.040
 performing exercises for the gluteal muscles 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.890
 so use a lot of weight will 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 difficult but if your crossover blocks 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.890
 a lot of pancakes and still advise 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.980
 gradually with each it is kai 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.350
 add and if we assume there are problems 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.170
 with a back better weight is less than 15-20 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.940
 reps if you have lower back muscles 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.150

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.920
 once a week with a maximum 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.690
 the intensity of his desire one more time 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.680
 week with medium intensity viz 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.700
 less load 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.920
 very important in all the exercises that we 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.590
 gluteus muscles to breathe correctly when 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.470
 dad muscle contraction i.e. 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.590
 getting up if it's a squat or when 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.169

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.320
 take a breath before we leave you 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.120
