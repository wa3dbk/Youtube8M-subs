00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.080
 People today will change the LEDs on the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 time panel 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730
 the first thing that already had a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 material that is a blank tape in your 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.920
 preference 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.840
 welding soldering iron panel 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.320
 then we have taken all the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:30.619
 screws on the side of the panel will 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:34.850
 cover with and now the most dangerous part 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.850
 take the screw out of here 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.809
 We have access to the sign where they are 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.540
 the nerds 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 You can see it, it gets hard not 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 can pull the pointer 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:18.259
 it is hard it is pretty hard were pulling 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 fear that he leaves quietly for this 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.619
 we are here as you can see the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.200
 arrow headlamp leds high injection all 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.200
 here these here we will not move but 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.500
 Let's play, they're just on the plate to change. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 the panel color 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.159
 Now let's not take those screws off. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 low to release the plate and the galley 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.200
 We'll get it out of here later. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.050
 now we have the circuit in hand to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 reach the leds can take this 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:04.250
 bolt and if these plates aqe the two 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 screws 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.100
 now that I'm going to use pliers 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.140
 you can use a doctor of pliers 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.549
 I'm going to use this one because it's the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:23.720
 The only one I have here at the moment you 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:31.590
 and mouse and leave the cut here 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 focus and then one cut is crooked the other 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.859
 has to leave rating to pass after 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.310
 have done the four here just pull that 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.620
 She leaves and the light ones we are going to change with 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:54.739
 sure here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:03:01.230
 3 if I'm not mistaken here and this one 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.730
 of the light here on the speedometer to change these 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.870
 Here we go and get the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:12.950
 soldering iron will melt 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 this sun here is this one takes the LED 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.640
 take what's on the tape and put it on 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.549
 place 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.239
 How can you see the led I do not know if 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:28.709
 It will give focus but it has the cut in 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.209
 up both what is on the board while 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.400
 what 's on the tape 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.440
 so you have to put exactly 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.500
 how are you in the cut because otherwise 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.430
 it will not work 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.810
 I'll make the leftovers now and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.660
 After finishing soldering we go 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.470
 see how you stayed there guys 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.420
 I took the ribbon four LEDs on the board now 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.040
 I'll take the ones on the plate for 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.650
 take what 's here take the tongs 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.840
 secure in the led and melts the solder and goes 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.769
 pulling does not pull too hard for 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.159
 do not ruin 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:15.180
 I'll try to make one for you. 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:22.010
 have a notion of computing must have 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:26.160
 careful not to ruin board galley 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:32.479
 forced here pulled it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:36.440
 He leaves only here to have another side. 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.440
 that the led goes loose 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:48.180
 only to take care of a pallet 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.560
 plate and elisson and so it will do with 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.680
 these here too 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.379
 1 to 1 I'm going to do here a little later 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.240
 Let's ride the other milks , guys. 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.370
 then soldier 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:07.439
 I'm going to test the first led I 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:10.770
 I am hence the law 3 yellow and blue 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:13.860
 this is the Blue soldered now returned from 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.919
 these three here I'll close the panel I 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.830
 I did so I just give a test to see if it's 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.020
 Good, because as I told you, he has 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.060
 a cut not always the cut has to 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.490
 have jumped on the panel if the thigh 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.990
 Up they have to go up if the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.590
 Coast down does not have to stand for 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.509
 low 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.279
 the soldier the rest because a little we 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:37.560
 You will see how it was gang 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:40.349
 finishing the soldering of the leds of mine 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.940
 works is not to give of the most perfect 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:46.909
 the last test all the lights the 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.009
 neighbors 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.770
 Now just put the panel in close 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.529
 place is ready or close to mount 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.029
 to see how it got there're guys 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:03.599
 almost set up how are you doing? 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:04.469
 blue panel is watching mota with 197 km 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.490
 wheeled 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:11.819
 I could not open the panel because it is 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.219
 a very simple thing to do that 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.900
 I'm not going to close the panel for you to see 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.849
 How is she going to feel comfortable about me? 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.580
 It's cute and it's getting nice to give 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:25.110
 To get an idea when it's time to close here. 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.589
 behind remember to come back with the bend 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:32.400
 here again the fans who hold the panel 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:34.319
 of brand mileage as I've been there 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.099
 almost completed the assembly of the 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.529
 panel 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.909
 it means practically finished now 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:44.490
 the test worked 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:48.539
 Everyone, the pointer will have to 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.960
 call him irregular in his hand to see that 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.020
 sometimes it gets down 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.630
 is the next from zero goes putting and goes 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.639
 regulating him and I in my case I was 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.539
 doing so was regulating itself 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:08.470
 connected here attached below and 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:12.250
 do so and tested and went to get 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:15.550
 in his degree, now, just ride in a galley 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:22.449
 and if the completion and panel as is 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:26.400
 who was left blue and all 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:32.580
 fillet cooking effects 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.580
 now we'll see 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.509
 i national in morals that's it
