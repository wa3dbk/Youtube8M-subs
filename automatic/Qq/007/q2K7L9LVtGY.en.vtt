came with the original box that only had
two<00:01:49.080> entries<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> maybe

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
two entries so now you can have a maybe

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
two entries so now you can have a maybe
a<00:01:50.760> four-player<00:01:51.210> game<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.900> etc<00:01:52.080> nor<00:01:52.590> have

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
more options at least and it's a really

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.800 
more options at least and it's a really
nice<00:01:54.930> board<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> downside<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.450> where<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
nice board now the downside is where I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.210 
nice board now the downside is where I
to<00:01:57.930> flip<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:58.470> because<00:01:58.860> hey<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
to flip this over because hey it's a

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.899 
to flip this over because hey it's a
double<00:01:59.490> sided<00:01:59.640> map<00:02:01.340> except<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.400> it's<00:02:02.610> not

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
double sided map except that it's not

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.990 
double sided map except that it's not
this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> exact<00:02:04.439> same<00:02:04.890> mansion<00:02:05.549> map<00:02:05.759> that

this is the exact same mansion map that
came<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.049> base<00:02:07.229> game<00:02:07.340> it's<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.489> repeat<00:02:08.909> so

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
came with the base game it's a repeat so

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.879 
came with the base game it's a repeat so

disappointed<00:07:03.320> me<00:07:03.440> it<00:07:03.770> adds<00:07:03.980> a<00:07:04.100> little<00:07:04.250> bit<00:07:04.370> to

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550

it<00:07:04.610> but<00:07:04.790> it<00:07:04.880> doesn't<00:07:05.150> add<00:07:05.300> a<00:07:05.330> whole<00:07:05.600> new<00:07:05.660> flavor

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
it but it doesn't add a whole new flavor

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.620 
it but it doesn't add a whole new flavor
to<00:07:06.860> the<00:07:07.010> game<00:07:07.220> so<00:07:07.610> I<00:07:07.640> can't<00:07:07.940> give<00:07:08.120> it<00:07:08.150> more<00:07:08.450> than

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
to the game so I can't give it more than

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.560 
to the game so I can't give it more than
just<00:07:08.840> about<00:07:09.020> 5050<00:07:09.800> shot<00:07:09.830> about<00:07:10.250> a<00:07:10.280> five<00:07:10.490> I<00:07:10.790> mean

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
just about 5050 shot about a five I mean

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.590 
just about 5050 shot about a five I mean
the<00:07:11.720> 67<00:07:12.410> range<00:07:12.620> if<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:12.980> love<00:07:13.310> tannhäuser<00:07:13.850> then

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.600

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.030 
the 67 range if you love tannhäuser then
it's<00:07:14.750> worth<00:07:14.900> getting<00:07:15.170> I<00:07:15.470> mean<00:07:15.650> pick<00:07:15.800> it<00:07:15.920> up

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
it's worth getting I mean pick it up

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.440 
it's worth getting I mean pick it up
especially<00:07:16.520> since<00:07:16.940> you<00:07:17.030> can<00:07:17.120> find<00:07:17.300> it<00:07:17.420> for

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
especially since you can find it for

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.270 
especially since you can find it for
better<00:07:17.660> prices<00:07:17.900> of<00:07:18.200> course<00:07:18.410> if<00:07:18.620> you<00:07:18.710> shop

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
better prices of course if you shop

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.430 
better prices of course if you shop

mind sinking the money into it you

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.010 
mind sinking the money into it you
really<00:07:25.310> like<00:07:25.490> this<00:07:25.700> system<00:07:26.210> and<00:07:26.420> you<00:07:26.660> want<00:07:26.870> the

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
really like this system and you want the

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.290 
really like this system and you want the
pieces<00:07:27.410> and<00:07:27.620> that<00:07:28.070> extra<00:07:28.340> map<00:07:28.520> great<00:07:28.850> the

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 
pieces and that extra map great the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.000 
pieces and that extra map great the
thing<00:07:29.510> it<00:07:29.600> does<00:07:29.750> ring<00:07:29.990> though<00:07:30.170> is<00:07:30.320> a<00:07:30.500> lot<00:07:30.890> of

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 
thing it does ring though is a lot of

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.680 
thing it does ring though is a lot of
the<00:07:31.070> scenarios<00:07:31.400> in<00:07:31.790> the<00:07:31.880> basic<00:07:32.270> rule<00:07:32.450> book

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
the scenarios in the basic rule book

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.990 
the scenarios in the basic rule book
can't<00:07:33.410> be<00:07:33.530> played<00:07:33.830> with<00:07:34.340> just<00:07:34.370> the<00:07:34.790> base<00:07:34.970> game

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
can't be played with just the base game

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000 
can't be played with just the base game
because<00:07:35.720> it<00:07:35.870> covers<00:07:35.990> so<00:07:36.230> many<00:07:36.320> expansions<00:07:36.710> you

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.010 
because it covers so many expansions you

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.830 
because it covers so many expansions you
actually<00:07:37.340> need<00:07:37.610> this<00:07:37.820> box<00:07:38.090> to<00:07:38.300> play<00:07:38.510> a<00:07:38.540> lot<00:07:38.750> of

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
actually need this box to play a lot of

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.950 
actually need this box to play a lot of
the<00:07:38.930> scenarios<00:07:40.060> so<00:07:41.060> it's<00:07:41.360> worth<00:07:41.570> it<00:07:41.780> for<00:07:41.930> that

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
the scenarios so it's worth it for that

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.590 
the scenarios so it's worth it for that
too<00:07:42.320> again<00:07:43.250> I'd<00:07:43.460> be<00:07:43.640> in<00:07:43.760> the<00:07:43.790> six<00:07:44.210> ish<00:07:44.390> range

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:44.600 
too again I'd be in the six ish range

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.660 
too again I'd be in the six ish range
probably<00:07:44.960> but<00:07:45.710> if<00:07:45.950> you<00:07:46.100> want<00:07:46.310> to<00:07:46.400> play<00:07:46.550> those

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.670 
probably but if you want to play those

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.610
