00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
hi guys for just in the studio here

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.419 
hi guys for just in the studio here
setting<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.240> still<00:00:12.480> life<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.190> thought<00:00:14.309> we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
setting up a still life and I thought we

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
setting up a still life and I thought we
might<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.700> interested<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.780> I'm<00:00:16.049> lighting

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
might be interested in how I'm lighting

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.460 
might be interested in how I'm lighting
it<00:00:16.710> because<00:00:17.600> light<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.070> about

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
it because light is what it's all about

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.599 
it because light is what it's all about
you<00:00:22.470> know<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> placement<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you know there's the placement of the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.810 
you know there's the placement of the
objects<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:25.279> that's<00:00:26.279> pretty<00:00:26.609> critical

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
objects which are that's pretty critical

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
objects which are that's pretty critical
but<00:00:27.359> also<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.230> placement<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> light<00:00:31.189> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
but also the placement of the light and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.560 
but also the placement of the light and
I<00:00:32.279> could<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.579> done<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> any<00:00:33.090> number<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I could have done this any number of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.970 
I could have done this any number of
ways<00:00:33.719> I've<00:00:33.989> done<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.290> pretty<00:00:34.559> quickly<00:00:34.829> just

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ways I've done this pretty quickly just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
ways I've done this pretty quickly just
for<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> cardboard<00:00:35.880> box<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:38.600> desk<00:00:39.600> lamp

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
for the cardboard box and a desk lamp

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.260 
for the cardboard box and a desk lamp
here<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> hundred<00:00:40.680> watt<00:00:40.980> bulb<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
here it's got a hundred watt bulb in it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.020 
here it's got a hundred watt bulb in it
and<00:00:45.270> I've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.489> fluorescent<00:00:47.489> light<00:00:47.670> over

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and I've got a fluorescent light over

and I've got a fluorescent light over
the<00:00:48.149> top<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> had<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:50.989> get<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.199> cover

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.869 
the top here so I had to get to cover
the<00:00:52.620> something<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.710> did

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879

the let light from shining in my eyes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.809 
the let light from shining in my eyes
because<00:01:33.979> you'll<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.399> take<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.819> away

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.630 

that<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.240> changes<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.280> scene<00:01:47.280> having

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that it really changes the scene having

the strongest light that's on the scene
as<00:02:37.859> this<00:02:38.069> lets<00:02:38.910> light<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.660> there

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
as this lets light up in there

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.240 
as this lets light up in there
and<00:02:41.960> what<00:02:42.080> I've<00:02:42.200> tried<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.740> with<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:43.070> is

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and what I've tried to do with it is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.510 
and what I've tried to do with it is
tilt<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> light<00:02:44.120> if<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.570> can<00:02:44.750> see<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> that

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
tilt the light if you can see it so that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.510 
tilt the light if you can see it so that
just<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.510> front<00:02:48.080> portion<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.920> scene<00:02:49.280> is

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
just the front portion of the scene is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.240 
just the front portion of the scene is
is<00:02:49.940> left<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.570> then<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> back<00:02:51.440> goes<00:02:51.920> into

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
is left and then the back goes into

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.790 
is left and then the back goes into
shadow<00:02:53.110> there's<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.170> lot<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.410> things<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.740> think

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
shadow there's a lot of things to think

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.340 
shadow there's a lot of things to think
about<00:02:54.980> when<00:02:55.400> you're<00:02:55.750> setting<00:02:56.750> up<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.110> still

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
about when you're setting up the still

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.920 
about when you're setting up the still
life<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.000> most

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
life and and this is the most

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.540 
life and and this is the most
time-consuming<00:03:00.230> part<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.160> whole<00:03:01.280> process

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
time-consuming part of the whole process

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.330 
time-consuming part of the whole process
is<00:03:01.910> just<00:03:02.150> setting<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.660> thing<00:03:02.870> up<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:04.070> took<00:03:04.190> me

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
is just setting the thing up it took me

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.130 
is just setting the thing up it took me
about<00:03:04.520> two<00:03:04.760> hours<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:05.240> set<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.600> up<00:03:05.810> with<00:03:05.990> all

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
about two hours to set this up with all

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.050 
about two hours to set this up with all
the<00:03:06.260> moping<00:03:06.530> around<00:03:09.400> doesn't<00:03:10.400> seem<00:03:10.670> like<00:03:10.850> much

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the moping around doesn't seem like much

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.760 
the moping around doesn't seem like much
for<00:03:11.330> two<00:03:11.480> hours<00:03:11.690> setting<00:03:11.990> up<00:03:12.170> does<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.560> but

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
for two hours setting up does it but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.920 
for two hours setting up does it but
thing<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.430> really<00:03:13.730> like<00:03:13.880> about<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.270> setup<00:03:14.570> is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
thing I really like about this setup is

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.920 
thing I really like about this setup is
that<00:03:14.990> I've<00:03:15.410> got<00:03:15.650> my<00:03:15.800> canvas<00:03:16.310> right<00:03:16.640> beside<00:03:17.090> my

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that I've got my canvas right beside my

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.830 
that I've got my canvas right beside my
subject<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:20.120> very<00:03:20.480> easy<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
subject so that it's it's very easy to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.380 
subject so that it's it's very easy to
compare<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> two<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.040> then<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.000> really<00:03:23.240> just

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
compare the two and then it really just

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.480 
compare the two and then it really just
becomes<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:24.050> game<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.320> spot<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.920> difference

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
becomes a game of spot the difference

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.600 
becomes a game of spot the difference
okay<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.480> let's<00:03:26.780> see<00:03:26.900> how<00:03:27.050> we<00:03:27.110> go<00:03:27.640> my<00:03:28.640> palate<00:03:29.000> is
