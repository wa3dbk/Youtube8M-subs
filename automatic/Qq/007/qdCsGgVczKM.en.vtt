00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
so let them open up in good fortified

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
so let them open up in good fortified
water<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.840> has<00:01:36.990> floral<00:01:37.409> life<00:01:37.530> food<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.549> so

water that has floral life food in it so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
water that has floral life food in it so
that'll<00:01:39.270> open<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> hydrate<00:01:40.320> beautifully

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that'll open up and hydrate beautifully

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
that'll open up and hydrate beautifully
so<00:01:41.130> you'll<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> maximum<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so you'll get the maximum use out of
