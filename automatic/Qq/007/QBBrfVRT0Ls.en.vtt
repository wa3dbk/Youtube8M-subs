it back up and what do you know it would
start<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> started<00:00:24.900> researching<00:00:25.230> online

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
start so I started researching online

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.310 
start so I started researching online
looking<00:00:26.699> stuff<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> YouTube<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.990> whatnot

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and I kept coming across main relay

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.479 
and I kept coming across main relay
assembly<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.440> thought<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> hell<00:00:35.250> I'll

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the part the part looks like this I have

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
the part the part looks like this I have
a<00:01:05.700> Japanese<00:01:06.000> made<00:01:06.570> model<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.110> American

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a Japanese made model not an American

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.590

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so the it's not hard to replace it's not

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.249 
so the it's not hard to replace it's not
hard<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:17.400> remove<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:19.140> the

hard to actually remove it and put the
new<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.340> hard<00:01:20.759> part<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
new one in the hard part is where it is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.899 
new one in the hard part is where it is
it<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.000> actual<00:01:24.740> hard<00:01:25.740> place<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.640> if

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it is an actual hard place to get to if

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359

you are a big person with very large
hands<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.000> suggest<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.079> trying<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.619> yourself

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210

bolt<00:02:40.709> right<00:02:41.040> there<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.690> there's<00:02:43.110> one

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
bolt right there and then there's one

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.940 
bolt right there and then there's one
right<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:45.049> remove<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.380> bolt<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.799> was

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
right there I remove this to bolt it was

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.039 
right there I remove this to bolt it was
really<00:02:47.250> easy<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.970> used<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.420> ten<00:02:48.840> millimeter

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
really easy I just used a ten millimeter

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.809 
really easy I just used a ten millimeter
socket<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.319> see<00:02:52.819> there's

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
socket and then if you can see there's

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.789 
socket and then if you can see there's
another<00:02:54.030> bolt<00:02:54.540> right<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.170> that's<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
another bolt right there that's for the

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.089 
another bolt right there that's for the
main<00:02:56.069> relay<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.989> little<00:02:58.230> black<00:02:58.380> box<00:02:58.680> just

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
main relay the little black box just

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.620 
main relay the little black box just
kind<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.459> slid<00:02:59.790> out<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.180> mine<00:03:00.420> didn't

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
kind of slid out the way mine didn't

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
kind of slid out the way mine didn't
have<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> bolt<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.799> bolt<00:03:02.040> holding<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
have a bolt but one bolt holding it in I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.130 
have a bolt but one bolt holding it in I
couldn't<00:03:02.970> get<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.209> other<00:03:03.390> bolt<00:03:03.630> loose<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.110> I

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
couldn't get that other bolt loose so I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.910 
couldn't get that other bolt loose so I
just<00:03:04.590> kind<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.459> slid<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> side<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
just kind of slid it to the side and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.559 
just kind of slid it to the side and

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
then the silver bracket is attached to

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.319 
then the silver bracket is attached to
this<00:03:12.569> black<00:03:12.959> box

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
there

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.030 
there
it<00:03:26.100> was<00:03:26.370> fairly<00:03:26.760> simple<00:03:27.450> once<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.260> got<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
it was fairly simple once I got that the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.640 
it was fairly simple once I got that the
power<00:03:29.400> steering<00:03:29.700> box<00:03:30.030> out<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.480> way<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:31.109> was

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
power steering box out of the way it was

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.770

fairly<00:03:31.980> simple<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:33.500> remove<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.100> then

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
fairly simple to remove that and then

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.900 
fairly simple to remove that and then
there's<00:03:36.780> two<00:03:37.140> locks<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:38.160> wire<00:03:38.340> harness

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.670 
there's two locks on the wire harness
and<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.329> little<00:03:39.600> clip<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.079> just<00:03:40.109> used<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and then a little clip I just used a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
and then a little clip I just used a
small<00:03:41.100> flat-head<00:03:41.489> screwdriver<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.450> carefully

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
small flat-head screwdriver to carefully

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.440 
small flat-head screwdriver to carefully
pry<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.560> loose<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.630> then<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.060> put<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> new
