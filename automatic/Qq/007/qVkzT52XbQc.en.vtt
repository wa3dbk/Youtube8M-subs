00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
in 2.6 there's video transitions so you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.500 
in 2.6 there's video transitions so you
can<00:03:11.159> put<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.579> something<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:13.129> maybe

recording and what it's doing right now
is<00:03:24.120> screening<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.019> audio<00:03:25.380> Wow<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:26.280> worked

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
is screening the audio Wow it worked

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.640 
is screening the audio Wow it worked
again<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.389> take<00:03:27.540> tiny<00:03:27.840> video<00:03:28.349> really

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
again this and take tiny video really

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.670 
again this and take tiny video really
cool<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.810> would<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.200> if<00:03:31.590> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
cool and then what we would do if we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.830 
cool and then what we would do if we
were<00:03:32.040> finished<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:32.760> would<00:03:32.970> save<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.480> project

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
were finished we would save this project

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
that same file for immersion and then we

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.869 
that same file for immersion and then we
can<00:03:53.370> pick<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.639> up<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.269> next<00:03:54.780> video<00:03:55.879> so

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
can pick it up in the next video so

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.089 
can pick it up in the next video so
that's<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.239> for<00:03:57.540> today

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that's it for today
