00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 from the city of Toluca to the city of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.060
 ixtapan de la sal was previously 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 forced to walk on a road 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.010
 quite sinuous and dangerous because it borders 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 an extremely deep precipice almost 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.830
 vertical and solid rock currently 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 there is a highway one day of so many a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.359
 bus departed from ixtapan de la sal with 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 heading to toluca the trip was the most 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 normal although it circulated at night 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 many of the passengers had done that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.300
 trip several times so they took advantage 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.759
 to sleep the bus started the trip 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 full went up the slope without problems 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 when it started to rain like so many 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.239
 times in that part of the road then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 reached the highest point and then started 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.200
 the descent and they started the famous 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 CalderÃ³n curves a stretch of road 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.550
 in which the curves are extremely 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 closed and dangerous also 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 characterized by that regardless of whether 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.489
 goes to toluca or comes from it that part 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.559
 It is downhill because it is part of a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 quite large hollow and where there is a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.399
 bridge in which only fits a car and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.039
 it is also when leaving a curve very 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.049
 closed on that bridge have happened 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 very serious accidents and many of them 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.540
 mortals is so deep that if not for 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.700
 the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.790
 amount of sharp stones on the sides 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.070
 It could easily be attached one monk 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.170
 bus in question started its descent 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.660
 with rain and of course the pavement 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 suddenly the passengers got wet 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 they realize that the bus is winning 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.320
 speed and they get scared by claiming 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.540
 driver who does not say anything at all 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 then extremely nervous finally atina 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.760
 to say they are failing the brakes on 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 little time the bus takes so much 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.900
 speed that is impossible to control and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 in a curve the bus rushes to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.440
 empty many die instantly to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.660
 cause of the blow 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.850
 others lie unconscious until the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.550
 bus burns down and in a short time it is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 consumed by the flames no one heard 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.630
 the cries of the few passengers who 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.710
 they asked for help and everyone dies in a way 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 horrible 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 meanwhile in the offices of the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.070
 central bus do not receive the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.990
 report that bus number 40 of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.510
 this bus line has arrived 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.400
 it's too late and it was the last 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.440
 at night so that if it broke down not 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.630
 there will be another that reaches it and can bring 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.060
 to the passengers so that a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.100
 vehicle to investigate does not seem to have 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.020
 trace of him throughout the journey to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.819
 least not until you get to the curves of 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.620
 calderÃ³n where a patrol of the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.200
 police has located a terrible 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.330
 accident there are no survivors and the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.830
 bodies are some shattered out of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.739
 what was left of the bus and others 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.900
 calcined inside it was only 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.580
 news for a short time but from 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 that date and at night if you 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.900
 you find on the ixtapan road of 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.390
 the salt towards toluca at night and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.550
 you try to get on a bus it is possible 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
 that is the number 40 that stops and you 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.170
 open the door when you approach it you will notice that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.330
 it's an old bus but in good 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.670
 conditions and like some lines of 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.130
 buses use not so new vehicles 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.290
 you will not mind much but then you 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.390
 he notices that even when he's full 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.810
 people standing there is always a place 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.560
 empty 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.660
 or two 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 It is always in accordance with the number of 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.069
 people who have just come up nobody 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.230
 occupy those so partners so you feel 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.780
 even when it seems weird and you feel a 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.670
 empty in your stomach you realize that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 despite the hour nobody will sleep 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.380
 women men and children are awake 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.930
 but nobody speaks not even children 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.560
 it's a heavy silence plus everyone goes 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.480
 well arranged because nobody knows the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.489
 the driver's assistant who reviews the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 tickets or charges you the ticket starts 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.660
 few minutes later to review the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.030
 you prepare the amount of your ticket but 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.610
 never goes to your place to request the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.730
 cost that's even weirder but you think 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.830
 that when you get off at the terminal you will pay 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 you arrive to toluca without setbacks but 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.060
 after midnight then the driver 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.890
 stops the unit before reaching the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 terminal and it tells you that you must get off at 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 that moment although the journey has not 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.400
 finished and you do not understand the reason 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.620
 you obey then when you reach the height 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.019
 of the driver the only one who speaks and 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.540
 trying to pay for your passage tells you that 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.370
 it's nothing and add low now and do not turn 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.260
 before he closes the door or never 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.480
 you will leave the bus 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.579
 those who obey come down and do not turn 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.290
 but until you hear the sound of 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.450
 the door when closing and the motor of the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.700
 bus start only to realize 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.400
 that there is no bus this same has 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.139
 Disobedient disappeared when going down 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.570
 and turn you see on the done bus 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.060
 pieces within fleshless skeletons and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.949
 the driver looking at you without saying anything 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.919
 the bus disappears and the person in 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.960
 issue dies a few days later it says 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.389
 that from that moment his ghost 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.120
 get on the bus and you will travel eternally in 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.639
 him because of his disobedience if by 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.620
 chance one day you travel to ixtapan from 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.960
 salt and back your car does not work 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.030
 Do not risk if it is night 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.270
 get on a bus maybe it's the 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.830
 number 40 if so, just obey the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.229
 instructions in this way you can 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.479
 tell it otherwise you will be condemned 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.080
 to travel that route on that bus through 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.080
 the eternity
