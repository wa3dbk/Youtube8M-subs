00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 also is considered all the way through then 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 2009 at issue number 104 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 spiritual 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.579
 at the beginning of the second week speaks 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 also from this knowledge the third 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.360
 preamble ask what I want this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.270
 will be here asking for an acquaintance 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.270
 inside of the lord who for me was 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.939
 made man so that I love and the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.909
 target more preamble of the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.070
 contemplation of the incarnation 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 this demand is essential we 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
 are Christians to the measure of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.900
 knowledge we have of our 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.939
 lord jesus christ this knowledge 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 multiform is a job and his 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.799
 which a job because we have to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 have a donation 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.360
 because knowledge is a 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.100
 communication from him to us all 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.229

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 inner knowledge 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.299
 maybe we can understand it at 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 from other fields of the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.590
 knowledge in or that of the craft 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.140
 given the particular art 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 just ask people who 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 for a long time practicing an art or a 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 job they will say that one day they have 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.140
 the principles outside but from 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.360
 the interaction with the object this is true

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.240
