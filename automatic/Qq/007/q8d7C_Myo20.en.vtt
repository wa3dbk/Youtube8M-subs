00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
realizing that the that the real benefit

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.640 
realizing that the that the real benefit
probably<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> only<00:02:48.370> benefit<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.480> doing<00:02:50.440> this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
probably the only benefit and doing this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.710 
probably the only benefit and doing this
you<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.520> actually<00:02:51.700> continue<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.510> stir

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
you have to actually continue to stir

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.210 
you have to actually continue to stir
this<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.050> day<00:02:53.230> long<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.620> only<00:02:53.739> benefit

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
this all day long and the only benefit

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.500 
this all day long and the only benefit
in<00:02:54.340> doing<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.820> hanging<00:02:55.090> out<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.330> family

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
in doing this is hanging out with family

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.410 
in doing this is hanging out with family
and<00:02:56.040> visiting<00:02:57.040> because<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.300> could

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and visiting because I think you could

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.290 
and visiting because I think you could
probably<00:02:58.480> buy<00:02:59.519> apple<00:03:00.519> butter<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:00.940> applesauce

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
probably buy apple butter or applesauce

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.070 
probably buy apple butter or applesauce
or<00:03:01.690> whatever<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.350> if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:04.080> for

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
or whatever if you if you like it for

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.100 
or whatever if you if you like it for
less<00:03:05.320> than<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.680> process<00:03:06.420> would<00:03:07.420> cost<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.959> in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
less than this process would cost you in

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.220 
less than this process would cost you in
time<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:09.000> hanging<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> family<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.870> as

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
45 minutes and then we'll start testing
