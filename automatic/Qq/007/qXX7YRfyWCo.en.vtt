on<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.699> time<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.660> business<00:00:42.900> is<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.290> brutal

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
on the time this business is a brutal

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.900 
on the time this business is a brutal
business<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> end<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> day<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.850> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
business but the end of the day this is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
business but the end of the day this is
exactly<00:00:48.600> decisions<00:00:49.199> on<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.559> shouldn't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
exactly decisions on that shouldn't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
exactly decisions on that shouldn't
really<00:00:49.949> be<00:00:50.129> made<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.489> instinct<00:00:50.970> but<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.420> think

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
really be made on instinct but I think

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
traditional an early so I don't think

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.240 
traditional an early so I don't think
