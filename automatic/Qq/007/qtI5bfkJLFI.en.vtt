00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.769
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.849
 theme 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.630
 and we continue to pass levels in 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:24.300
 goblins means I thought like him 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.739
 Pass I realized that we will need 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:35.270
 barbarians wall and a small pile 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 balls means first produced here and 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.579
 here these one wall of battle then us 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.810
 need to break 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.810
 well on this mortar and 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.640
 so here we release the barbarians 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:03.239
 Now here they will break I will tell you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.840
 then do something else like a couple 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 fine 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.179
 then release one ball and then 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.979
 after some time another 4 and exactly 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:18.859
 same here to hit on 1 and not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.649
 all at once 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:26.429
 Now we have almost a year well, so do not 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.929
 left a couple of guns here they are 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.619
 quick now with all this 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.619
 cope 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.689
 I basically did not even earn 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.390
 because they asked me 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.770
 throw them like balls too well i don't 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.640
 could refuse so i wo n't even 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 connect 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.509
 though ok archer to have them like this 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.039
 here are from 30 and 40 will be great 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.049
 I think quickly they cope now 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:11.950
 quite and obvious pyaterochka 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:15.970
 the next level will be ready there I 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.920
 I donâ€™t even know myself yet 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:24.239
 I do not remember the name of the archers of almost all 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.569
 killed the bad bombs 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.569
 so everything is ready for new meetings
