00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and just getting you to you know get

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
and just getting you to you know get
over<00:00:30.840> your<00:00:30.960> fear<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.259> try<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.580> okay<00:00:32.580> so<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
first step is confidence so you need a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.049 
first step is confidence so you need a
lot<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.090> confidence<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.870> move<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.940> lot<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
lot of confidence for this move a lot of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
lot of confidence for this move a lot of
you<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.809> huge<00:00:40.379> fear<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.040> did

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you will have a huge fear I know I did

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330 
you will have a huge fear I know I did
when<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.329> started<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:43.129> but<00:00:44.129> eventually

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
when I first started out but eventually

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
when I first started out but eventually
just<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> get<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.420> fear<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.190> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
just got to get over your fear and you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.350 
just got to get over your fear and you
know<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.550> try<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.030> should<00:00:51.180> work

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
know just try it out and it should work

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.350 
know just try it out and it should work
out<00:00:51.539> probably<00:00:51.930> better<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.320> learn<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
out probably better to learn it on a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
out probably better to learn it on a
trampoline<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:56.160> how<00:00:56.370> most<00:00:56.760> people

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
trampoline first that's how most people

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
trampoline first that's how most people
start<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.870> trying<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> trampoline

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
start out just trying to trampoline

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 
start out just trying to trampoline
maybe<00:00:59.690> might<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> better<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> start<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.620> you're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
maybe might be better to start if you're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
maybe might be better to start if you're
at<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> trampoline<00:01:02.370> club<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.910> sure<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> got

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
at a trampoline club for sure you got

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.340 
at a trampoline club for sure you got
them<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> teach<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.110> you're<00:01:04.320> just

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
them to teach you there if you're just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
them to teach you there if you're just
starting<00:01:04.620> out<00:01:05.600> definitely<00:01:06.600> don't<00:01:06.750> try<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
starting out definitely don't try on the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
starting out definitely don't try on the
move<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.710> no<00:01:07.920> idea<00:01:08.190> how<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
move if you have no idea how to do it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.970 
move if you have no idea how to do it
I've<00:01:09.210> seen<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.710> they're

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
I've seen some people you know they're

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.590 
I've seen some people you know they're
still<00:01:11.310> increasing<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> whoa<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.480> just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
still increasing a whoa and they just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.540 
still increasing a whoa and they just
hope<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> best<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.440> no<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.220> land

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
hope for the best but no they like land

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.120 
hope for the best but no they like land
on<00:01:14.670> their<00:01:14.790> head<00:01:14.910> so<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> once<00:01:16.830> you've<00:01:16.950> gotten

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
on their head so so once you've gotten

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090 
on their head so so once you've gotten
over<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.490> confidence<00:01:18.860> what<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

do you can either put your arms up like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
do you can either put your arms up like
this<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> start<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:23.760> them<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.000> here

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this to start or put them up here

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.510 
this to start or put them up here
whichever<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.050> prefer

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
whichever you prefer

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.420 
whichever you prefer
where<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.940> go<00:01:27.560> down<00:01:28.560> swing<00:01:29.400> your

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
where it is going to go down swing your

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.510 
where it is going to go down swing your
arms<00:01:29.760> back<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.300> about<00:01:31.290> medium<00:01:32.010> don't<00:01:32.340> bend

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
arms back and about medium don't bend

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
arms back and about medium don't bend
too<00:01:32.640> low<00:01:32.940> like<00:01:33.120> this<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:35.130> can't<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.670> not

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
too low like this and you can't like not

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
too low like this and you can't like not
bend<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.650> spend<00:01:37.830> about<00:01:38.040> medium

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
bend at all so just spend about medium

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240 
bend at all so just spend about medium
and<00:01:38.610> you're<00:01:39.510> just<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> swing<00:01:40.800> your<00:01:40.980> arms

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and you're just going to swing your arms

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.470 
and you're just going to swing your arms
up<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:42.390> high<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.680> head

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
up as high as you can up to your head

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.110 
up as high as you can up to your head
that's<00:01:45.480> probably<00:01:45.870> better<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.850> jump<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.000> as

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
that's probably better and jump up as

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.800 
that's probably better and jump up as
high<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.420> can

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
high as you can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.370 
high as you can
just<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> few<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.650> these<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:50.300> just
