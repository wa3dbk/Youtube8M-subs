workhorse<00:02:34.359> I<00:02:35.049> know<00:02:35.469> a<00:02:35.590> lot<00:02:35.799> of<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.040> guys<00:02:36.189> like

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
workhorse I know a lot of you guys like

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.229 
workhorse I know a lot of you guys like
the<00:02:36.939> back<00:02:37.150> were<00:02:37.450> parted<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.849> that's<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
the back were parted out but that's the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.020 
the back were parted out but that's the
business<00:02:40.450> were<00:02:40.750> in

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.280 

and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.559 

so<00:02:53.620> there's<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.129> tractor<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.879> we<00:02:55.239> will<00:02:55.420> be

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
so there's a tractor that we will be

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.810 
so there's a tractor that we will be
burning
