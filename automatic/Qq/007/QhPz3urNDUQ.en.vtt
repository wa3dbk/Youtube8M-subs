00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hello dear colleagues with you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 re arthur salt thrill i'm helping 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
 jewelry companies work more 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.670
 effectively 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 I am glad to welcome you in the last 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 video tutorial on tech 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 jewelry sales 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.490
 directly unit complete sales with 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.529
 one side it may seem that the block 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.160
 quite simple and not even discussing 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.710
 subject to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 but I assure you have a few moments 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 some worth staying well 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.070
 first sellers when gets 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 some affirmative answer in favor 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.720
 Buyer's choice is included know 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.380
 here in the eyes of the cartoon are literally 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.110
 dollar is visible and when the seller is already 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.620
 hear what i buy here literally 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 takes and accelerates toward the braids after all 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 agree 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 the buyer has this at the moment 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 feeling if I made the right choice 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 and whether I need jewelry, I chose and whether 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 for such costs to buy decorations and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.530
 it might even be worth buying not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.110
 decoration something else we are with you when 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 ordinary buyer buy clothes 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.970
 buy a phone or home appliances us 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.370
 with you very often jars when we 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.940
 come home we come and we look 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.240
 some 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.460
 and clothes costumes dresses boots and we 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
 we understand that in the store it looked 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.830
 as something different and does not shine and already 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.409
 so not happy and there is a share of doubt 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.950
 and there are returns and if all the same 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.610
 the purchase is not so weighty and we yes we 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.560
 leave 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.200
 but acceptable to this store next 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 times where we literally us 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.530
 manipulated eventually sold well 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 maybe we will come and maybe not 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.960
 agree with this and the task of the last 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 stage completion of sales 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.479
 I think not only knock out knock out the check but 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.650
 it would be a wrong task to take off 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.900
 stress from the client is instill in him 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.820
 confidence in slime into him hope that 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.979
 this is really the decoration of which 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.080
 he chose really he never 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 must regret buying this purchase 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 must be realized for him 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.260
 so now we will talk with you about 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.510
 some tools that allow 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.050
 increase efficiency and we will start 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.150
 quite from a simple moment it is well 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.460
 just complete the presentation and move on 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.800
 to completion yes this often happens 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.330
 certainly not worth it after two questions or 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.220
 two sentences in the presentation at once 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.670
 go to the end but it will 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 hurriedly but there are sellers who are well 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.750
 you know they kind of told the client 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.000
 already shows consent signs seller 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.350
 they are not heard and continue to present 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.240
 keeps talking about 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.400
 stone characteristics continue 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.470
 tell their producers continues 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.660
 tells about all sorts of magical zodiac 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.700
 properties and so on but everything is already 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.800
 customers do not have to finish it do not need it 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.180
 ready is he in such a hurry and 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.980
 just more still more bucket and more bucket and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.440
 customer closes i.e. of course 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 as a rule, sales are rarely disrupted 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.570
 already just gotta exhausted well let's go 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.550
 ears, let's take the case and right here 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.210
 it is very important for the seller to have subtle points 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.430
 feel when the client is already in one step 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.970
 completed the sale he needs help 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.790
 so let's talk what matters 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.220
 evidence that the buyer is already 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.610
 in principle, tune in firstly this 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.520
 Please read the total price for 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.760
 the second is the question warranty questions a 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.000
 additional discounts questions about return 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.890
 Questions about payment methods are all in 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.800
 principle demonstrates increased 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.870
 interest is also a return to such 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.360
 presentation well for example you said that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.700
 such a lock is the most reliable and 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.750
 they ask you and is it really 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.100
 the most reliable lock 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.590
 that is, you understand that this is already 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.290
 increased interest from the client and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.380
 then you can also go to the stage 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.489
 complete how to proceed to the stage 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.810
 finish by saying we make it out 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.360
 still not a little jewelery 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.340
 let me tell you about a few 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.110
 tools that will allow more 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.570
 gently proceed to completion 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.880
 1 soft enough option is to ask 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.400
 An alternate question is what customer chose. 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.140
 this decoration or it if he chooses 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.490
 of several but when the client you 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.530
 says she stopped at this all in 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.169
 principle translate to completion either 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.139
 ask about whether to pick up a case 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.330
 Well, finally, you can ask about convenient 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.319
 individuals of payment one way or another client to you on 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.599
 is that something to answer 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.330
 if you hurry a little then you 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.949
 It is worth returning to the presentation stage if 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.860
 the client is calm and answers in the affirmative 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.110
 then you can go directly to 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.479
 completion and literally some more 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.340
 tips that I would like to give when working 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.400
 somewhere in the cashier zone 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.449
 Well, firstly it must underline 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.430
 correctness of choice made in order 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.430
 to relieve that responsibility from 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.229
 voltage with the client and secondly give more 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.539
 some one advantage 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.840
 which is not mentioned nor discussed earlier the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.919
 there is if you talked about tacks but not 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.529
 said let's say 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.169
 about the purity of a stone, tell me what 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.789
 given komi such a frequency that is but 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.060
 this is if their positive characteristics 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.770
 hell 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.719
 but you understood me that is to say 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.879
 something that you haven't said before 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.379
 but emphasizes the right thing 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.939
 of choice 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:26.520
 sure to offer to become a member 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.279
 closed club and here it is very important not 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.009
 just say you want to get 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.659
 discount card or fill out the form 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.110
 it is important to make it clear that yes it is a discount 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.509
 map 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 what gives the membership of your private club 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.529
 because ten years ago 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.509
 discount card for us were what you 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.099
 know so he is a luxury item and everything 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.830
 there were several and in portman and we 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.770
 inserted literally everything now for everyone 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:53.069
 there is such a stack of discount cards and 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.589
 your right to be in your wallet 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.960
 Everyone takes, of course, not all 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.490
 so you need to clearly explain what 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.039
 gives your discount card 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.610
 is it just a discount or an extra 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.830
 service 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.990
 think about it and tell me 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.689
 all features are your discount and 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.189
 bonus systems and all features 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.899
 discount card holders 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.189
 and of course you need to say goodbye to 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:14.639
 the client is necessarily visual 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.430
 contact 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.800
 this smile and goodbye phrases as well 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.180
 hopes to see the client again perhaps 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.669
 all you need to know at the end 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.919
 sales if you have any questions on 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.039
 what we discussed today 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.139
 either in principle there are some questions on 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.270
 the completion phase of the sale is a must 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.669
 send me their mail info 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.339

 answer them soon with you 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:43.879
