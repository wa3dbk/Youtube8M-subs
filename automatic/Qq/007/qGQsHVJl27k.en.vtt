flight<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.160> sudden<00:03:29.489> Ricky<00:03:29.849> was

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
flight all of a sudden Ricky was

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.850 
flight all of a sudden Ricky was
uncomfortable<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.840> disturbed<00:03:31.440> by<00:03:31.500> something

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
uncomfortable and disturbed by something

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.190 
uncomfortable and disturbed by something
she<00:03:32.430> jumped<00:03:32.819> up<00:03:32.940> tried<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.360> stand<00:03:33.629> up<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.019> she

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
she jumped up tried to stand up but she

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.839 
she jumped up tried to stand up but she
didn't<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> whole<00:03:34.890> lot<00:03:35.069> of<00:03:35.099> room<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.670> move

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
didn't have a whole lot of room to move

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.819 
didn't have a whole lot of room to move
around<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.390> change<00:03:36.569> positions<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.620> think

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
around and change positions and I think

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.440 
around and change positions and I think
this<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.099> one<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> main<00:03:38.670> reasons<00:03:39.120> why<00:03:39.239> all

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
this is one of the main reasons why all

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.059 
this is one of the main reasons why all
of<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.599> sudden<00:03:39.870> she<00:03:40.019> just<00:03:40.290> seemed<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.769> be<00:03:40.799> having

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
this is the first time she's really

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.129 
this is the first time she's really
portrayed<00:04:08.730> any<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.150> these<00:04:09.299> behaviors<00:04:09.870> and

weren't<00:04:11.099> really<00:04:11.519> expecting<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:12.209> Ricky<00:04:12.840> did

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
weren't really expecting it Ricky did

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.289 
weren't really expecting it Ricky did
settle<00:04:13.349> down<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.950> when<00:04:14.220> we<00:04:14.370> did<00:04:14.549> land<00:04:14.849> she<00:04:15.120> had

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
no problem with this it didn't seem to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.039 
no problem with this it didn't seem to
bother<00:04:17.280> her<00:04:17.609> at<00:04:17.820> all<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.269> did<00:04:18.450> wait<00:04:18.660> for<00:04:18.900> pretty

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.629 
bother her at all we did wait for pretty
much<00:04:19.139> everybody<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.950> leave<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.220> plane<00:04:20.430> before

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
much everybody to leave the plane before

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.370 
much everybody to leave the plane before
we<00:04:21.000> left<00:04:21.180> our<00:04:21.359> seats<00:04:21.630> we<00:04:21.810> were<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> very

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
we left our seats we were in the very

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.770 
we left our seats we were in the very
last<00:04:22.680> row<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.430> was<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> very<00:04:23.910> tight<00:04:24.270> fit<00:04:24.539> so

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
last row and it was a very tight fit so

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600 
last row and it was a very tight fit so
it<00:04:24.870> was<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.169> easier<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:25.620> us<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.160> get<00:04:26.280> Ricky

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
it was just easier for us to get Ricky

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.159 
it was just easier for us to get Ricky
off<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.880> plane<00:04:27.090> after<00:04:27.840> waiting<00:04:28.050> for

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
off the plane after waiting for

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.230 
off the plane after waiting for
everybody<00:04:28.590> else<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.160> leave<00:04:29.340> first<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.000> she

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
everybody else to leave first and she

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.450 
everybody else to leave first and she
handled<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:31.110> well<00:04:31.260> no<00:04:31.740> polling<00:04:32.250> no

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
handled it really well no polling no

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.279 
handled it really well no polling no
lunging<00:04:32.940> she<00:04:33.180> walked<00:04:33.389> off<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.720> plane<00:04:33.840> very

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
lunging she walked off the plane very

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.260 
lunging she walked off the plane very
nicely<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.010> back<00:04:35.639> through<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.060> terminal

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
nicely and back through the terminal

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.170 
nicely and back through the terminal
until<00:04:36.690> we<00:04:36.930> got<00:04:37.080> outside<00:04:37.760> okay<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:38.820> obviously

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
until we got outside okay so obviously

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.330 
until we got outside okay so obviously
when<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.810> fly<00:04:39.990> somewhere<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.830> got<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.130> fly

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
when you fly somewhere you got to fly

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.960 
when you fly somewhere you got to fly
home

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
home

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.029 
home
so<00:04:42.389> Ricky's<00:04:42.720> experienced<00:04:43.200> flying<00:04:43.500> home<00:04:43.710> was<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
so Ricky's experienced flying home was a

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.589 
so Ricky's experienced flying home was a
little<00:04:44.370> bit<00:04:44.490> different<00:04:44.700> than<00:04:45.000> her<00:04:45.150> experience

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
little bit different than her experience

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.610 
little bit different than her experience
flying<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.110> our<00:04:46.229> destination

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
flying to our destination

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.800 
flying to our destination
so<00:04:48.620> in<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.860> flight<00:04:49.069> home<00:04:49.370> Ricky<00:04:50.120> had<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.509> bigger

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
so in the flight home Ricky had a bigger

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.409 
so in the flight home Ricky had a bigger
airplane<00:04:51.319> so<00:04:51.650> we<00:04:51.770> had<00:04:51.979> more<00:04:52.490> room<00:04:52.729> for<00:04:52.759> her<00:04:53.120> and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
airplane so we had more room for her and

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.450 
airplane so we had more room for her and
this<00:04:53.720> time<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.199> wasn't<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.620> full<00:04:54.800> flight<00:04:55.039> and<00:04:55.250> we

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
this time it wasn't a full flight and we

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.580 
this time it wasn't a full flight and we
had<00:04:55.639> enough<00:04:56.030> storage<00:04:56.569> room<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:57.139> put<00:04:57.380> all<00:04:57.530> of

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
had enough storage room to put all of

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.960 
had enough storage room to put all of
our<00:04:57.860> carry-on<00:04:58.280> luggage<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.940> overhead

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
our carry-on luggage in the overhead

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.360 
our carry-on luggage in the overhead
bins<00:04:59.599> not<00:05:00.319> to<00:05:00.440> mention<00:05:00.620> there<00:05:00.860> was<00:05:00.889> a<00:05:00.979> lot<00:05:01.340> more

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
bins not to mention there was a lot more

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.790 
bins not to mention there was a lot more
legroom<00:05:01.699> for<00:05:02.120> her<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:02.720> we<00:05:03.169> ended<00:05:03.380> up<00:05:03.470> with<00:05:03.650> an

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
legroom for her so we ended up with an

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.559 
legroom for her so we ended up with an
hour-and-a-half<00:05:04.280> delay<00:05:04.940> where<00:05:05.360> we<00:05:05.479> were

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
hour-and-a-half delay where we were

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:06.969 
hour-and-a-half delay where we were
actually<00:05:05.660> sitting<00:05:06.080> on<00:05:06.319> the<00:05:06.440> plane<00:05:06.590> for<00:05:06.860> that

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
actually sitting on the plane for that

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.409 
actually sitting on the plane for that
whole<00:05:07.160> hour<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.550> half<00:05:07.699> on<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.210> tarmac

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
whole hour and a half on the tarmac

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.689 
whole hour and a half on the tarmac
waiting<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.319> approval<00:05:09.860> from<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.340> tower<00:05:10.520> to

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
waiting for approval from the tower to

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.700 
waiting for approval from the tower to
get<00:05:10.940> our<00:05:11.150> takeoff<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.840> delay<00:05:12.169> didn't<00:05:12.440> seem<00:05:12.590> to

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
get our takeoff the delay didn't seem to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.409 
get our takeoff the delay didn't seem to
bother<00:05:12.830> Ricky<00:05:13.340> at<00:05:13.430> all<00:05:13.669> she<00:05:14.030> was<00:05:14.060> much<00:05:14.389> more

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
bother Ricky at all she was much more

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.210 
bother Ricky at all she was much more
comfortable<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.080> this<00:05:15.199> airplane<00:05:15.380> she<00:05:15.979> had<00:05:16.190> a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
comfortable on this airplane she had a

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.070 
comfortable on this airplane she had a
lot<00:05:16.580> more<00:05:16.759> room<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.030> stretch<00:05:17.210> out<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.900> change

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
lot more room to stretch out and change

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.809 
lot more room to stretch out and change
positions<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.889> I<00:05:18.979> think<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.340> was<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.490> huge

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
positions and I think that was a huge

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.520 
positions and I think that was a huge
factor<00:05:19.880> of<00:05:20.360> why<00:05:20.479> she<00:05:20.750> was<00:05:20.840> uncomfortable<00:05:21.380> on

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
factor of why she was uncomfortable on

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.499 
factor of why she was uncomfortable on
the<00:05:21.620> flight<00:05:21.860> earlier<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.849> when<00:05:23.000> we<00:05:23.120> finally

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
the flight earlier so when we finally

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.730 
the flight earlier so when we finally
took<00:05:23.690> off<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.199> got<00:05:24.229> going

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
took off and got going

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.920 
took off and got going
Ricky<00:05:25.069> seemed<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.460> handle<00:05:25.819> it<00:05:25.909> very<00:05:25.940> well<00:05:26.569> but

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
Ricky seemed to handle it very well but

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.809 
Ricky seemed to handle it very well but
once<00:05:27.110> again<00:05:27.259> a<00:05:27.470> few<00:05:27.770> minutes<00:05:28.009> into<00:05:28.190> flight

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
once again a few minutes into flight

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.939 
once again a few minutes into flight
Ricky<00:05:29.210> started<00:05:29.599> panting<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.530> panting

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
Ricky started panting this panting

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.339 
Ricky started panting this panting
wasn't<00:05:31.280> nearly<00:05:31.699> as<00:05:31.880> bad<00:05:32.240> as<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.599> first<00:05:32.630> trip

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
wasn't nearly as bad as the first trip

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.960 
wasn't nearly as bad as the first trip
she<00:05:33.620> seemed<00:05:33.889> much<00:05:34.069> more<00:05:34.130> relaxed<00:05:34.789> but<00:05:34.909> still

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
she seemed much more relaxed but still

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.790 
she seemed much more relaxed but still
needed<00:05:35.509> a<00:05:35.720> little<00:05:35.990> something<00:05:36.349> to<00:05:36.409> calm<00:05:36.590> her

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
needed a little something to calm her

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.309 
needed a little something to calm her
down<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.819> when<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.630> beverage<00:05:38.900> cart<00:05:39.080> came

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
down so when the beverage cart came

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.290 
down so when the beverage cart came
through<00:05:39.680> we<00:05:39.860> asked<00:05:40.159> for<00:05:40.280> an<00:05:40.400> extra<00:05:40.729> cup<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:41.060> ice

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
through we asked for an extra cup of ice

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.180 
through we asked for an extra cup of ice
too<00:05:41.599> so<00:05:41.840> we<00:05:42.169> could<00:05:42.349> give<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.710> little<00:05:42.830> bit<00:05:43.009> to

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
too so we could give a little bit to

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.649 
too so we could give a little bit to
Ricky<00:05:43.490> this<00:05:43.759> seemed<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.210> help<00:05:44.389> her

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
Ricky this seemed to help her

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:45.730 
Ricky this seemed to help her
tremendously

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
tremendously

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.680 
tremendously
she<00:05:46.340> was<00:05:46.460> probably<00:05:46.819> pretty<00:05:47.030> thirsty<00:05:47.539> after

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
she was probably pretty thirsty after

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.050 
she was probably pretty thirsty after
our<00:05:47.990> long<00:05:48.229> delay<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:48.889> Matt<00:05:49.430> sat<00:05:49.699> there<00:05:49.940> and

fed her I skips very slowly and she

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.279 
fed her I skips very slowly and she
seemed<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.789> settle<00:05:53.060> right<00:05:53.180> down<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:53.930> ended<00:05:54.169> up

much water in the ice cubes as a bowl of
water<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.360> it<00:06:08.810> seemed<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.229> really<00:06:09.500> help

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860

now<00:06:14.570> I<00:06:14.599> want<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:14.960> make<00:06:15.080> it<00:06:15.259> clear<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.800> trip

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
now I want to make it clear that a trip

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.670 
now I want to make it clear that a trip
like<00:06:16.340> this<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.699> not<00:06:17.210> for<00:06:17.479> every<00:06:17.719> puppy<00:06:18.110> Ricky's

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
like this is not for every puppy Ricky's

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.080 
like this is not for every puppy Ricky's
only<00:06:19.069> the<00:06:19.219> third<00:06:19.400> puppy<00:06:19.699> that<00:06:19.849> I<00:06:19.909> have

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
only the third puppy that I have

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.059 
only the third puppy that I have
attempted<00:06:20.389> to<00:06:20.659> put<00:06:20.840> on<00:06:21.020> an<00:06:21.139> airplane<00:06:21.469> and<00:06:21.800> this

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
attempted to put on an airplane and this

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.589 
attempted to put on an airplane and this
is<00:06:22.219> because<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.550> lot<00:06:22.849> of<00:06:22.909> our<00:06:23.120> other<00:06:23.240> puppies

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
is because a lot of our other puppies

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.659 
is because a lot of our other puppies
have<00:06:23.780> not<00:06:23.960> been<00:06:24.169> mature<00:06:24.560> or<00:06:24.830> had<00:06:25.520> the
