00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.330 
info on the vessel side particulars that
are<00:02:22.660> being<00:02:22.900> transmitted<00:02:23.500> from<00:02:23.680> their<00:02:23.890> AIS

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
are being transmitted from their AIS

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.290 
are being transmitted from their AIS
system<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.430> an<00:02:27.550> antenna<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.000> put

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
system and then I have an antenna I put

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.060 
system and then I have an antenna I put
out<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.780> even<00:02:29.500> greater<00:02:30.070> GPS<00:02:30.760> accuracy<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:32.070> it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
out for even greater GPS accuracy and it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.610 
out for even greater GPS accuracy and it
gathers<00:02:33.340> my<00:02:33.730> GPS<00:02:34.180> position<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:35.500> it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
gathers my GPS position and then it

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.229 
gathers my GPS position and then it
takes<00:02:35.800> from<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> vessel<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.910> AIS

takes from the vessel that AIS

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.449 
takes from the vessel that AIS
information<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.320> give<00:02:38.500> me<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.920> traffic

around me and with all that information

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.470 
around me and with all that information
I'm<00:02:43.150> able<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.780> better<00:02:43.959> assess<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.680> situation

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
I'm able to better assess the situation

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.150
