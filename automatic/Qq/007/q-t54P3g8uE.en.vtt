touchdown<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.149> more<00:01:54.360> games<00:01:54.630> he's<00:01:55.229> ahead<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
touchdown or more games he's ahead of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
touchdown or more games he's ahead of
some<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.070> good<00:01:56.310> quarterbacks<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.509> list

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
some very good quarterbacks on that list

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
some very good quarterbacks on that list
he<00:01:57.960> does<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.530> capability<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.369> coming

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
he does have that capability of coming

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.749 
he does have that capability of coming
up<00:02:00.119> big<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.290> given<00:02:01.590> moment<00:02:01.770> probably<00:02:02.549> more

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
up big in a given moment probably more

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
up big in a given moment probably more
so<00:02:02.939> than<00:02:03.060> Geno<00:02:03.329> Smith<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.719> probably<00:02:03.960> wouldn't

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so than Geno Smith we probably wouldn't

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319 
so than Geno Smith we probably wouldn't
look<00:02:04.409> at<00:02:04.590> at<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.890> even<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> DFS<00:02:05.880> play<00:02:06.060> no

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
look at at all even as a DFS play no

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
look at at all even as a DFS play no
you're<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.750> certainly<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> mean<00:02:07.680> he<00:02:07.860> throws

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you're right certainly I mean he throws

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
you're right certainly I mean he throws
the<00:02:08.340> ball<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.520> mean<00:02:08.819> he<00:02:08.940> tosses<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.599> ball<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the ball I mean he tosses the ball and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.380 
the ball I mean he tosses the ball and
he<00:02:09.899> has<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> better<00:02:10.259> ball<00:02:10.619> than<00:02:10.920> Geno<00:02:11.280> Smith<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
he has a better ball than Geno Smith and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370 
he has a better ball than Geno Smith and
certainly<00:02:12.840> he's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
certainly he's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.870 
certainly he's
perience<00:02:13.800> enough<00:02:14.100> where<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.610> he<00:02:14.730> can

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
perience enough where you know he can

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.400 
perience enough where you know he can
make<00:02:15.000> better<00:02:15.180> decisions<00:02:15.360> than<00:02:15.720> Gino<00:02:16.020> has<00:02:16.200> made

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
make better decisions than Gino has made

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.570 
make better decisions than Gino has made
over<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.710> we've<00:02:16.890> seen<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> makeover<00:02:17.430> the
