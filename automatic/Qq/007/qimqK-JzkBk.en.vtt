00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.180

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.949

 come update and I have 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.220
 found a glitch where still 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.199
 goes and brutal where also here 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.570
 is going to blow so you've already seen 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.329
 you can get out on all maps but the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.940
 question is how are you doing 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.629
 first a satcom and a ballistics 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.750
 vest a ball is vest would be now 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.640
 have you earned the satcom and the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.050
 ball is reste now needs of course 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.780
 on your buddy 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.729
 I'll show you this from both sides 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.289
 that you see exactly how to do it 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.899
 first you have to put it there 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:16.610
 and then you wait until the thing feels that way 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.100
 the bowl on the back is like that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.259
 Forward time then you can get the ball 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 is vest on it lay down and throw down 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.640
 take away the thing so now is whole 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.970
 important now you have to deal with yours 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.610
 chatting off when he starts the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.110
 ball is vest to take 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.270
 you have to press down 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.310
 he would have to put the thing down and he is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.990
 of course you have to go in there with me 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.840
 headset or skype or whatever 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.799
 you have to make an appointment says and already is 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 he in there 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.500
 and now I'll show you like that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.689
 looks from the other perspective 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 he already had a cam strike here 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.840
 that's why it's a bit dark and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
 yellow and I wanted to go here too 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.189
 show that it is really everywhere 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.110
 make every map on the new dlcs 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.630
 can no matter what app on call of 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.490
 Duty guest of the glitch is simply the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.520
 Hammer then you can do it everywhere 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.399
 You see, he throws the ball is vest 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.690
 just right there on it and now 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.160
 he takes away the satcom and the ball is 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.799
 west is hovering in the air 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.590
 you have to stand this way and not 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.630
 but as they lay there you 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 Namely, are stretched to the back 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.760
 so in the fence so would have to be so 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.340
 stand 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.260
 and when I start to take 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.579
 let him know right away I'll take it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.799
 and he then puts down the satcom 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 pulled back and so and already 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.069
 me in it 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.810
 Saugeil Glitches really goes for everyone 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.090
 map you can go anywhere no matter 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.769
 say 90 percent no matter where we are 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 so many places will be there 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.239
 incredible 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.069
 and here in the aquarium is also again 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.329
 recorded 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.859
 we do not have it so nice 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.720
 managed like some others 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.579
 But I found the aquarium 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.190
 just seen the biggest in person 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.819
 of course on the new dlcs last 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.680
 rausgekommen are the map and see here 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.239
 you again he throws the ball is west 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.060
 you now throw it on top and 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.500
 it is wrong wood is down and he is wrong 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.139
 but also has a reaction box 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.060
 that is also possible 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:24.200
 Ammo box does not work 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.489
 and simply the satcom is for take away 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 has now put outwit destroyed 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.730
 that does not annoy satcom again 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 take away 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.970
 you stand with your back to it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.370
 her buddy and if he so if you 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.199
 you tell him here pushes now 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.010
 square and of course he has to be in front too 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.829
 be ready 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.859
 then he puts it down to take 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.319
 and you're in there where you 're inside 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.590
 wanted to pack on the map and that's it 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.810
