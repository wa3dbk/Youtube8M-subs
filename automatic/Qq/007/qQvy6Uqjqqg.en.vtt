well<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> once<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> just

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
well so once that's on you kind of just

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.230 
well so once that's on you kind of just
line<00:02:55.400> line<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.500> plastic<00:02:58.500> cover<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.940> at<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
line line the plastic cover on at the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.240 
line line the plastic cover on at the
back<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:04.230> sure<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:06.030> nice<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.240> snug

now<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.430> phone<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.880> not<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> thin<00:03:09.390> phone<00:03:09.630> to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
now this phone is not a thin phone to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.890 
now this phone is not a thin phone to
begin<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.700> OtterBox<00:03:11.700> had<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.300> difficult

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
begin with so OtterBox had a difficult

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.980 
begin with so OtterBox had a difficult
job<00:03:13.110> trying<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.620> keep<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.210> size<00:03:15.210> down<00:03:15.690> while

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
job trying to keep the size down while

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.950 
job trying to keep the size down while
also<00:03:16.200> keeping<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:17.640> phone<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.120> protected<00:03:18.780> as

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
also keeping the phone as protected as

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.530 
also keeping the phone as protected as
they<00:03:19.230> want<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.970> commuter<00:03:21.660> series<00:03:21.900> 2<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.820> so

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
they want the commuter series 2 to be so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.320 
they want the commuter series 2 to be so
I<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.110> they<00:03:25.410> did<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> really<00:03:25.920> good<00:03:26.160> job<00:03:26.330> the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
I think they did a really good job the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.950 
I think they did a really good job the
last<00:03:27.570> part<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.200> snapping<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.980> top<00:03:29.280> on

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
last part is just snapping the top on

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.910 
last part is just snapping the top on
just<00:03:30.960> like<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.240> see<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:37.590> does

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
just like that and you can see it does

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.920 
just like that and you can see it does
not<00:03:38.420> block<00:03:39.420> any<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.080> screen<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:41.930> the

still very easy to press the camera
button<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.940> interesting<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:06.570> actually<00:04:06.990> a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
button is interesting it's actually a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.100 
button is interesting it's actually a
hard<00:04:07.410> plastic<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.940> they<00:04:09.150> use<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.810> makes

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
hard plastic that they use and it makes

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.330 
hard plastic that they use and it makes
it<00:04:10.290> quite<00:04:10.620> difficult<00:04:11.460> to<00:04:12.560> take<00:04:13.560> accidental

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
it quite difficult to take accidental

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.430 
it quite difficult to take accidental
shots<00:04:14.670> which<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.120> great<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:16.620> also<00:04:16.830> has<00:04:17.430> this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
shots which is great it also has this

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.460 
shots which is great it also has this
double<00:04:19.440> click<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.850> take<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> photo<00:04:21.840> I'll

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
double click when you take a photo I'll

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
double click when you take a photo I'll
show<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.800> here

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.300 

so<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.580> get<00:04:27.699> into<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.000> app<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.780> hold<00:04:29.020> down

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
so you get into the app you hold down

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.450 
so you get into the app you hold down
halfway<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.800> focus<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.070> then<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:36.039> whole<00:04:36.250> way

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
halfway to focus and then the whole way

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.029 
halfway to focus and then the whole way
to<00:04:37.330> take<00:04:37.509> the<00:04:37.660> photo<00:04:37.900> now<00:04:38.080> that's<00:04:38.289> pretty

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
to take the photo now that's pretty

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.580 
to take the photo now that's pretty
similar<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.639> lot<00:04:39.789> of<00:04:39.880> HTC<00:04:40.479> devices<00:04:40.750> now<00:04:41.440> this

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
similar to a lot of HTC devices now this

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.770 
similar to a lot of HTC devices now this
just<00:04:41.770> adds<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.160> little<00:04:42.280> bit<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.610> heft<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.660> it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
just adds a little bit of heft to it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.909 
just adds a little bit of heft to it
which<00:04:44.050> means<00:04:44.259> that<00:04:44.440> you're<00:04:44.530> not<00:04:44.560> going<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.860> be

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
which means that you're not going to be

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.730 
which means that you're not going to be
taking<00:04:45.280> any<00:04:45.430> accidental<00:04:46.360> shots<00:04:46.810> at<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.560> same

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
taking any accidental shots at the same

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.330 
taking any accidental shots at the same
time<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.070> may<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.639> little<00:04:49.090> bit<00:04:49.419> too<00:04:49.690> hard<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
time it may be a little bit too hard and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.159 
time it may be a little bit too hard and
I<00:04:51.520> would<00:04:51.639> like<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.850> see<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.360> lightened<00:04:53.080> a
