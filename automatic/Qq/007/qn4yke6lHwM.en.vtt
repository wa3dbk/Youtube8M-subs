is done by using 16 pin diagnostic
sockets

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.969 

next<00:01:22.030> connect<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> device<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.290> laptop<00:01:23.770> by

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
next connect the device to the laptop by

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.999 
next connect the device to the laptop by
using<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.460> USB<00:01:24.790> lead<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:29.380> locate<00:01:29.860> the

manufacturers technical website in this

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.630 
manufacturers technical website in this
example<00:01:34.840> we'll<00:01:35.289> be<00:01:35.320> using<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.890> Ford<00:01:36.250> ETA's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
example we'll be using the Ford ETA's

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.139 
example we'll be using the Ford ETA's
Technical<00:01:37.240> website<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:42.550> first<00:01:42.789> time<00:01:43.000> you

visit<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.509> website<00:01:43.539> you<00:01:44.530> will<00:01:44.679> need<00:01:44.860> to

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
visit the website you will need to

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.899 
visit the website you will need to
create<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.399> login<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.060> password<00:01:50.520> next<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.789> need

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
create a login and password next we need

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.700 
create a login and password next we need
to<00:01:52.060> identify<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.690> vehicle<00:01:53.229> be<00:01:53.350> connected

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
this can be done by using the vehicle

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:15.470 
this can be done by using the vehicle
registration<00:02:02.170> or<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.590> chassis<00:02:03.009> number

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.210 

once<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.750> identified<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.500> vehicle<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
once you have identified the vehicle the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.340 
once you have identified the vehicle the
next<00:02:18.520> step<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> connect<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.780> car<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
next step is to connect to the car the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.170 
next step is to connect to the car the
identity<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> vehicle<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:27.970> being
