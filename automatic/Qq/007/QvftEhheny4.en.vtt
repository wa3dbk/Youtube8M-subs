could<00:00:36.620> be<00:00:36.710> good<00:00:36.799> in<00:00:36.979> this<00:00:37.040> archetype<00:00:37.519> but<00:00:38.210> also

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
could be good in this archetype but also

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.689 
could be good in this archetype but also
because<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:39.049> still<00:00:39.680> didn't<00:00:40.070> want<00:00:40.220> to<00:00:40.309> not<00:00:40.489> play

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.660 
slot and in early testing is doing a lot
of<00:00:51.559> work<00:00:51.680> for<00:00:51.710> me<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.010> be<00:00:52.190> pretty<00:00:52.339> happy<00:00:52.519> with

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
of work for me to be pretty happy with

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.880 
of work for me to be pretty happy with
them<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.570> four<00:00:53.750> snapcaster<00:00:54.110> mage<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.530> obvious

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
them the four snapcaster mage is obvious

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
them the four snapcaster mage is obvious
in<00:00:55.040> this<00:00:55.159> archetype<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.820> I'm<00:00:56.720> trying<00:00:56.960> out<00:00:57.080> the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
in this archetype and I'm trying out the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.719 
in this archetype and I'm trying out the
dollar<00:00:57.350> hopefully<00:00:58.010> will<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.159> good<00:00:58.309> enough

with<00:00:59.000> damier<00:00:59.239> charm<00:00:59.479> I<00:00:59.689> think<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.049> could

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
with damier charm I think it could

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.729 
with damier charm I think it could
become<00:01:00.589> playing<00:01:00.830> 24<00:01:01.489> spells<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:03.559> me<00:01:03.650> that

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
become playing 24 spells and to me that

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.560 
become playing 24 spells and to me that
seems<00:01:03.830> like<00:01:04.010> enough<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.519> my<00:01:05.030> last<00:01:05.059> creature

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
seems like enough and my last creature

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.600 
seems like enough and my last creature
is<00:01:05.720> query<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:06.200> dry<00:01:06.500> add<00:01:06.710> which<00:01:07.400> i<00:01:07.430> think<00:01:07.520> is
