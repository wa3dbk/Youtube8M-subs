that's<00:01:12.540> an<00:01:12.690> interesting<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.530> fall

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

I<00:01:19.210> need<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.050> learn<00:01:20.200> some<00:01:20.530> what<00:01:20.830> would<00:01:20.950> make<00:01:21.100> a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
I need to learn some what would make a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.640 
I need to learn some what would make a
heel<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> minute<00:01:21.970> perfectly<00:01:22.840> well<00:01:23.080> but<00:01:23.410> there's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
heel a minute perfectly well but there's

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.020 
heel a minute perfectly well but there's
probably<00:01:23.920> not<00:01:24.010> gonna<00:01:24.190> be<00:01:24.250> any<00:01:24.430> point<00:01:24.700> because

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
probably not gonna be any point because

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
probably not gonna be any point because
he's<00:01:25.300> gonna<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.600> hitched<00:01:25.870> soon<00:01:26.020> enough<00:01:26.380> anyway

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
he's gonna be hitched soon enough anyway

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.770 
he's gonna be hitched soon enough anyway
once<00:01:27.580> he<00:01:27.670> hits<00:01:27.850> 99

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
once he hits 99

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.700 
once he hits 99
doesn't<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> waste<00:01:31.259> time<00:01:31.380> like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
doesn't have to waste time like

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.640
