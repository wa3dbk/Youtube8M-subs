these parts are exposed it still does
the<00:01:18.600> job<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:18.869> feels<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.310> snug

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the job well feels like it's really snug

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
the job well feels like it's really snug
and<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.990> feels<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> regular

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and it just feels like a regular

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.149 
and it just feels like a regular
ordinary<00:01:23.220> durable<00:01:24.030> case<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
ordinary durable case but you know this

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
ordinary durable case but you know this
is<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:26.790> part<00:01:27.060> 2<00:01:27.299> there's<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
is just the first part 2 there's a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.580 
is just the first part 2 there's a
second<00:01:28.080> part<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
second part now what you can do here is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
second part now what you can do here is
this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> gets<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> nice<00:01:32.990> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this is where it gets kind of nice this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.109 
this is where it gets kind of nice this
first<00:01:34.259> part<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.860> go<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.520> second<00:01:35.909> part

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
first part can go into the second part

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.649 
first part can go into the second part
and<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.869> acts<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> clip<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.850> maybe<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and now this acts as a clip so maybe you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
and now this acts as a clip so maybe you
can<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.960> ahead<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.200> attach<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> your

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
can go ahead and attach this to your

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
can go ahead and attach this to your
backs<00:01:41.700> clothing<00:01:42.450> maybe<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:42.810> on-the-go

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
backs clothing maybe you're on-the-go

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
backs clothing maybe you're on-the-go
