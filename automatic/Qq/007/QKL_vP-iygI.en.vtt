let me just draw a little one the
opposite<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:02.120> out<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> tail

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
opposite way out the back for the tail

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
opposite way out the back for the tail
then<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> face<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.009> draw

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
then for the face what we do is we draw

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.690 
then for the face what we do is we draw
an<00:01:08.750> oval<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:10.740> oval<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.549> eyes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
an oval there and an oval there for eyes

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460

and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.600> circle<00:01:13.020> highlight<00:01:13.350> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and then a little circle highlight in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.740 
and then a little circle highlight in
the<00:01:13.619> end<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:19.520> curved

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
the end there and then a little curved
semi<00:01:21.750> circle<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> mouth<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.639 
circle for a cheek and a circle for a
cheek<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:27.149> then<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.600> draw<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> two

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
cheek and then we just draw it one two

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.400 
cheek and then we just draw it one two
three<00:01:30.050> one<00:01:31.050> two<00:01:31.130> three<00:01:32.160> semi<00:01:33.090> circles<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
three one two three semi circles and the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.910 
three one two three semi circles and the
ends<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.479> teardrops<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.860> toys<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
ends of these teardrops for toys and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.760 
ends of these teardrops for toys and
then<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> shell<00:01:42.060> itself<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.679> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
then for the shell itself what we do is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.969 
then for the shell itself what we do is
we<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.069> a<00:01:44.220> curved<00:01:44.610> line<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.979> down

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
we just take a curved line out and down

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.840 
we just take a curved line out and down
and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.640> bring<00:01:47.819> it<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> I'm<00:01:50.429> rounds

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and then bring it back and I'm rounds

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.790 
and then bring it back and I'm rounds
like<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> head<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> each<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.530> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> comes

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
like the head so each time kind of comes

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.690 
like the head so each time kind of comes
backwards<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.429> forwards<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> touches<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
backwards and forwards it touches the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.950 
backwards and forwards it touches the
line<00:01:59.700> before<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:02.119> then<00:02:03.119> round<00:02:03.450> again<00:02:05.960> it's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
line before it then round again it's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.199 
line before it then round again it's
just<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.439> simple<00:02:07.649> way<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> drawing<00:02:08.340> some

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
just a really simple way of drawing some

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.819 
just a really simple way of drawing some
texture<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.019> shell<00:02:12.440> cool<00:02:13.440> then<00:02:13.620> what<00:02:13.739> we

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
texture on the shell cool then what we

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.390 
texture on the shell cool then what we
do<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.160> yeah<00:02:15.829> then<00:02:16.829> what<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.070> do<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.310> we

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
do is we just yeah then what we do is we

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
do is we just yeah then what we do is we
just<00:02:17.430> grab<00:02:17.730> our<00:02:17.850> black<00:02:18.030> pins<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:18.690> in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
just grab our black pins and go back in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:51.309 
just grab our black pins and go back in
and<00:02:18.959> inking<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> pencil<00:02:19.650> lines

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.229 

then<00:02:52.069> what<00:02:52.249> we<00:02:52.340> do<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.489> we<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:52.819> go<00:02:52.909> back<00:02:53.090> in

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
then what we do is we just go back in

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.550 
then what we do is we just go back in
and<00:02:53.420> double<00:02:53.629> up<00:02:53.719> the<00:02:53.810> thickness<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.379> main

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and double up the thickness of the main

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.259 
and double up the thickness of the main
parts<00:02:54.859> of<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.129> illustration<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:56.120> make

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
parts of the illustration just to make

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:27.780 
parts of the illustration just to make
it<00:02:56.420> look<00:02:56.540> even<00:02:56.689> more<00:02:56.840> cartoony

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.250 

can<00:03:28.330> we<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.540> wait<00:03:28.629> for<00:03:28.689> thing<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.049> dry<00:03:31.260> then

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
can we just wait for thing to dry then

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.240 
can we just wait for thing to dry then
we<00:03:32.319> just<00:03:32.439> go<00:03:32.560> back<00:03:32.709> in<00:03:32.829> and<00:03:32.920> rub<00:03:33.040> out<00:03:33.129> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
we just go back in and rub out the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:49.650 
we just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:03:33.579> lines

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.450 

so<00:03:50.380> there<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:51.010> cute<00:03:51.250> cartoon

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
so there you have it a cute cartoon

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.080 
so there you have it a cute cartoon
turtle<00:03:52.060> happy<00:03:52.870> drawing
