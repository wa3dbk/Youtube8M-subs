so<00:00:00.269> tell<00:00:00.900> me<00:00:00.930> again<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.909> volcano<00:00:02.909> fluid<00:00:05.240> will

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so tell me again the volcano fluid will

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.860 
so tell me again the volcano fluid will
actually<00:00:06.839> double<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.440> submarine<00:00:07.830> fuel<00:00:08.870> which

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
actually double as submarine fuel which

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.430 
actually double as submarine fuel which
makes<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.410> nuclear<00:00:10.920> submarine<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.349> we're

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
makes it a nuclear submarine so we're

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
makes it a nuclear submarine so we're
using<00:00:13.679> Earth's<00:00:14.130> nuclear<00:00:14.849> material<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.870> is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
using Earth's nuclear material which is

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
using Earth's nuclear material which is
powdered<00:00:16.650> lava<00:00:18.920> now<00:00:19.920> we're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> put<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
powdered lava now we're going to put the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
powdered lava now we're going to put the
sub<00:00:21.000> everybody<00:00:21.869> want<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.140> step<00:00:22.350> closer<00:00:22.619> where

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
sub everybody want to step closer where

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.099 
sub everybody want to step closer where
they<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:26.060> not<00:00:27.060> sure<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.599> see<00:00:30.109> shake

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
they can see not sure you can see shake

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.819 
they can see not sure you can see shake
it<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> let<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
it up and we're going to let it go and

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
it up and we're going to let it go and
we'll<00:00:34.829> watch<00:00:35.070> now<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.420> subs<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
we'll watch now as the subs on the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.910 
we'll watch now as the subs on the
bottom<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.360> container

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bottom of the container

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.889 
bottom of the container
function<00:00:41.789> and<00:00:42.440> here<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> comes<00:00:44.600> surfacing<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
function and here it comes surfacing to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
function and here it comes surfacing to
periscope<00:00:46.829> depth<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:49.159> now<00:00:50.159> is<00:00:50.430> cruising<00:00:50.940> at

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
periscope depth and now is cruising at

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.439 
periscope depth and now is cruising at
periscope<00:00:51.479> depth<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.729> it<00:00:53.729> will<00:00:53.850> continue<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
periscope depth and it will continue to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.329 
periscope depth and it will continue to
do<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.899> until<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.649> gets<00:00:55.829> done<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.070> its

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
do so until it gets done with its

do so until it gets done with its
observations<00:00:57.260> at<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:58.589> time<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.159> will<00:00:59.780> keel

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
observations at which time it will keel

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.469 
observations at which time it will keel
to<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.140> side<00:01:01.409> blow<00:01:02.309> its<00:01:02.519> ballast<00:01:02.909> tanks<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
to the side blow its ballast tanks and

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.249 
to the side blow its ballast tanks and
re<00:01:04.080> submerge<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> goes<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:07.020> down

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
re submerge and there it goes back down

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.499 
re submerge and there it goes back down
after<00:01:07.500> firing<00:01:07.920> its<00:01:08.100> torpedoes<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> Nazi

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.210 
after firing its torpedoes at the Nazi
submarine<00:01:10.049> show<00:01:11.689> then<00:01:12.689> after<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> Destroyers

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
submarine show then after the Destroyers

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.719 
submarine show then after the Destroyers
have<00:01:14.399> left<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.759> area<00:01:15.500> once<00:01:16.500> again<00:01:16.679> we<00:01:17.580> will

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
have left the area once again we will

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
have left the area once again we will
see<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.149> submarine<00:01:18.780> start<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> rise<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
see the submarine start to rise up to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.870 
see the submarine start to rise up to
periscope<00:01:20.789> depth<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.869> Thomas<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
periscope depth in here at Thomas and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
periscope depth in here at Thomas and
again<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.090> periscope<00:01:24.450> depth<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:25.380> takes<00:01:25.649> its

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
again at periscope depth it takes its

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.020 
again at periscope depth it takes its
readings<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:27.600> find<00:01:27.869> any<00:01:28.110> other<00:01:28.580> kraut<00:01:29.580> ships

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
readings to find any other kraut ships

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
readings to find any other kraut ships
that<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> area<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.950> fires<00:01:32.369> his

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that are in the area it fires his

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.050 
that are in the area it fires his
torpedoes<00:01:32.819> and<00:01:33.979> then<00:01:34.979> before<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.549> torpedo

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
torpedoes and then before the torpedo

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
torpedoes and then before the torpedo
strike<00:01:36.360> home<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.350> again<00:01:37.740> blows<00:01:38.100> its<00:01:38.399> ballast

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
strike home it again blows its ballast

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
strike home it again blows its ballast
tanks<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.360> heads<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.920> safety<00:01:41.190> of
