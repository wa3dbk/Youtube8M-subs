know I guess the UH the shorter map

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.420 
know I guess the UH the shorter map
there<00:05:35.030> or<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.420> way<00:05:35.540> I'm<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.710> was<00:05:36.860> like<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.160> was

expecting just as straight up I was
especially<00:05:42.110> since<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.860> felt<00:05:43.580> like<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.820> sick

it's<00:06:38.870> funny<00:06:39.050> because<00:06:39.200> he's<00:06:39.380> doing<00:06:39.590> it<00:06:39.680> on

it's funny because he's doing it on

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.620 
it's funny because he's doing it on
these<00:06:39.890> maps<00:06:40.160> where<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.520> just<00:06:40.880> would<00:06:41.330> assume

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
these maps where I just would assume

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.850 
these maps where I just would assume
that<00:06:41.960> there<00:06:42.140> would<00:06:42.230> be<00:06:42.260> other<00:06:42.500> builds<00:06:42.800> you

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
that there would be other builds you

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.460 
that there would be other builds you
want<00:06:43.040> to<00:06:43.130> do<00:06:43.280> I<00:06:43.490> like<00:06:44.390> I<00:06:44.630> guess<00:06:44.870> once<00:06:45.200> we<00:06:45.320> get<00:06:45.410> to

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
want to do I like I guess once we get to

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.980 
want to do I like I guess once we get to
pile<00:06:45.860> on<00:06:46.040> up<00:06:46.310> anywhere<00:06:47.240> i<00:06:47.300> mean<00:06:47.510> the<00:06:47.600> warp<00:06:47.810> in

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
pile on up anywhere i mean the warp in

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.260 
pile on up anywhere i mean the warp in
the<00:06:48.020> rush<00:06:48.890> can<00:06:49.220> get<00:06:49.370> there<00:06:49.520> just<00:06:49.670> as<00:06:49.790> fast<00:06:50.030> but

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
the rush can get there just as fast but

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.580 
the rush can get there just as fast but
i<00:06:50.980> gotta<00:06:51.980> say<00:06:52.160> i<00:06:52.190> think<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:53.290> overgrowth<00:06:54.290> it's<00:06:54.530> a

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
i gotta say i think a overgrowth it's a

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.320 
i gotta say i think a overgrowth it's a
good<00:06:54.770> map<00:06:54.920> for<00:06:55.220> it<00:06:55.310> because<00:06:55.460> this<00:06:55.910> is<00:06:56.030> a<00:06:56.060> map

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
good map for it because this is a map

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.180 
good map for it because this is a map
that<00:06:56.360> like<00:06:56.750> every<00:06:57.200> Zerg<00:06:57.410> chooses<00:06:57.830> every<00:06:58.040> time

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
that like every Zerg chooses every time

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.880 
that like every Zerg chooses every time
against<00:06:58.430> protoss<00:06:58.670> so<00:06:59.000> why<00:06:59.990> not<00:07:00.140> mix<00:07:00.350> in<00:07:00.500> a<00:07:00.560> very

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
against protoss so why not mix in a very

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.230 
against protoss so why not mix in a very
aggressive<00:07:01.160> build<00:07:01.550> on<00:07:01.760> that<00:07:01.790> room

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
aggressive build on that room

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.610 
aggressive build on that room
specifically<00:07:02.870> especially<00:07:03.050> when<00:07:03.380> you<00:07:03.440> get<00:07:03.500> on

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
specifically especially when you get on

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620 
specifically especially when you get on
a<00:07:03.680> map<00:07:04.520> like<00:07:04.700> that<00:07:04.940> where<00:07:05.150> yeah<00:07:05.510> the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
a map like that where yeah the

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.060 
a map like that where yeah the
expansions<00:07:06.110> are<00:07:06.230> very<00:07:06.440> far<00:07:06.710> away<00:07:06.800> from<00:07:07.010> the

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
expansions are very far away from the

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.010 
expansions are very far away from the
other<00:07:07.190> player<00:07:07.400> I<00:07:07.640> just<00:07:08.390> go<00:07:08.480> ahead<00:07:08.600> and<00:07:08.750> kill

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
other player I just go ahead and kill

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.200 
other player I just go ahead and kill
them<00:07:09.200> or<00:07:09.320> damage<00:07:09.680> them<00:07:09.830> early<00:07:10.190> on<00:07:10.220> so<00:07:11.030> you<00:07:11.120> know

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
them or damage them early on so you know

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.820 
them or damage them early on so you know
that<00:07:11.390> way<00:07:11.510> it<00:07:11.630> against<00:07:11.840> a<00:07:11.960> forecaster<00:07:12.590> you

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
that way it against a forecaster you

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.830 
that way it against a forecaster you
don't<00:07:12.980> have<00:07:13.070> to<00:07:13.160> fight<00:07:13.460> off<00:07:13.670> that<00:07:14.450> advantage

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
don't have to fight off that advantage

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.330 
don't have to fight off that advantage
they're<00:07:15.170> fundamentally<00:07:15.500> going<00:07:15.950> to<00:07:16.010> get<00:07:16.190> if

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
they're fundamentally going to get if

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.770 
they're fundamentally going to get if
they're<00:07:16.520> left<00:07:16.700> alone<00:07:16.820> on<00:07:17.120> that<00:07:17.270> map<00:07:17.450> for<00:07:17.720> a

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
they're left alone on that map for a

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.930 
they're left alone on that map for a
long<00:07:17.930> time<00:07:18.200> we<00:07:18.500> should<00:07:19.340> be<00:07:19.520> going<00:07:19.640> in<00:07:19.820> this

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
long time we should be going in this

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.890 
long time we should be going in this
last<00:07:20.210> map<00:07:20.450> pretty<00:07:20.690> quickly<00:07:20.930> here<00:07:21.020> um<00:07:22.900> looks

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
last map pretty quickly here um looks

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.570 
last map pretty quickly here um looks
like<00:07:24.050> actually<00:07:24.380> that's<00:07:24.500> ready<00:07:24.770> right<00:07:24.950> now<00:07:24.980> so

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
like actually that's ready right now so

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.090 
like actually that's ready right now so
we're<00:07:25.730> going<00:07:25.790> to<00:07:25.910> throw<00:07:26.000> that
