it's<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> fans<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> bottom<00:00:36.899> with

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it's kind of fans are at the bottom with

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
it's kind of fans are at the bottom with
a<00:00:37.230> slimmer<00:00:37.590> part<00:00:37.829> top<00:00:38.070> cut<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.850> template

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
a slimmer part top cut out this template

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
a slimmer part top cut out this template
this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.230> important<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.010> measure

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this is important you got to measure

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
this is important you got to measure
your<00:00:41.340> template<00:00:41.790> against<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> boot<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.469> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
your template against the boot so this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
your template against the boot so this
part<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.190> cinema<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.940> goes<00:00:45.120> into<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.719> boot<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
part is cinema it goes into the boot so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
part is cinema it goes into the boot so
I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.399> perfect<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.210> me<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
now go ahead and cut out two pieces

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
now go ahead and cut out two pieces
following<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> template<00:00:52.350> onto<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:53.100> fabric<00:00:53.520> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

more interest in show you kind of like
that<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.310> point<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.210> keep<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.020> down

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that it's a point to keep going on down

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.340 
that it's a point to keep going on down
the<00:01:25.799> length<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:27.150> fabric<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the length of the fabric so it kind of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.249 
the length of the fabric so it kind of
looks<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.920> lot<00:01:29.400> cuter<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.720> now<00:01:30.869> kind

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
looks a lot cuter like that so now kind

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.890 
looks a lot cuter like that so now kind
of<00:01:31.350> figure<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.829> again<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> shoe

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
of figure out again how much of the shoe

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420
