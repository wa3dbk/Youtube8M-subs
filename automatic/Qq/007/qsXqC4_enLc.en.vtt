they're<00:03:20.139> just<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.699> think<00:03:21.699> they're<00:03:21.849> better<00:03:22.030> than

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
they're just I think they're better than

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.930 
they're just I think they're better than
their<00:03:22.479> single<00:03:22.840> eyeshadows<00:03:23.379> or<00:03:24.310> even<00:03:24.790> their

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
their single eyeshadows or even their

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.119

palates they just have I think they have

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.939 
palates they just have I think they have
a<00:03:27.159> different<00:03:27.370> formula<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.150> those<00:03:28.449> are<00:03:28.629> the

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
a different formula so those are the

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.360 
a different formula so those are the
swatches<00:03:29.949> there<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.489> my<00:03:30.609> fingers<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.370> then

maybe<00:03:34.239> on<00:03:34.510> my<00:03:34.720> wrist<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:37.109> this<00:03:38.109> is<00:03:38.229> without

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
maybe on my wrist and this is without

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.740 
maybe on my wrist and this is without
primer<00:03:38.859> show<00:03:41.729> they're<00:03:42.729> much<00:03:42.940> more<00:03:43.090> vibrant<00:03:43.359> if

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750

you've<00:03:43.989> actually<00:03:45.750> used<00:03:46.750> primer<00:03:47.669> so<00:03:48.669> those<00:03:48.909> are

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
you've actually used primer so those are
