00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.060 
read is that gaming is very stimulating
for<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.310> brain<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.760> allows<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
for your brain it allows you to to have

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.070 
for your brain it allows you to to have
a<00:00:26.099> much<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:26.789> problem-solving<00:00:27.689> oriented

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a much more problem-solving oriented

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.620 
a much more problem-solving oriented
mindset<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.970> looking<00:00:30.480> at

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
mindset then if you will be looking at

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.430 
mindset then if you will be looking at
costumes<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.529> example<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.099> day<00:00:32.279> long<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> i

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
costumes for example all day long so i

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
costumes for example all day long so i
really<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.890> gaming<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.790> very

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
really think that gaming is a very

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
really think that gaming is a very
interesting<00:00:36.420> tool<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.820> only

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
interesting tool because it doesn't only

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
interesting tool because it doesn't only
it's<00:00:39.629> not<00:00:39.870> only<00:00:40.020> fun<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.829> actually

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
it's not only fun but it actually

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.150 
it's not only fun but it actually
stimulates<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.760> brain<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> very

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
stimulates your brain in a very

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
stimulates your brain in a very
interactive<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> gamer<00:00:48.450> era<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
interactive way so the gamer era or the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
interactive way so the gamer era or the
gamer<00:00:49.829> generation<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> growing<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.390> now

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gamer generation which is growing up now

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.590 
gamer generation which is growing up now
i<00:00:51.660> think<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:53.600> yeah

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
i think there will be a lot more yeah

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.279 
i think there will be a lot more yeah
there<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:59.840> get<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
there will be a lot more get up with the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
there will be a lot more get up with the
right<00:01:01.440> tools<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.100> find<00:01:02.579> solutions<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
right tools to find solutions to the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.410 
right tools to find solutions to the
problems<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:06.210> have

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
problems that we are going to to have

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
problems that we are going to to have
the<00:01:06.689> coming<00:01:07.049> decades<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> coming

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the coming decades the coming

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.539 
the coming decades the coming
generations<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> regard<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.250> really

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
generations so in that regard I really

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.899 
generations so in that regard I really
like<00:01:11.729> game<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
like game a lot and I also think that

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
like game a lot and I also think that
using<00:01:14.909> game<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.320> connection

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
using game as some kind of connection

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.740 
using game as some kind of connection
with<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.520> such<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> big<00:01:18.030> audience<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
with with such a big audience is a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
with with such a big audience is a
really<00:01:19.080> nice<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.880> mobilize<00:01:20.880> people<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really nice way to mobilize people to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
really nice way to mobilize people to
bring<00:01:22.080> change<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> increase<00:01:23.610> awareness

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bring change and to increase awareness

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.109 
bring change and to increase awareness
around<00:01:24.360> certain<00:01:24.810> issues<00:01:25.970> because<00:01:26.970> without

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
around certain issues because without

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
around certain issues because without
what<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.750> been<00:01:27.990> realizing<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.979> than

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
what I have been realizing more than

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
what I have been realizing more than
ever<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.750> reach<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.079> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
ever is that if you want to reach out to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.620 
ever is that if you want to reach out to
people<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> wanna<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.509> you're

being a bring a certain missions across

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
being a bring a certain missions across
it's<00:01:35.549> important<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> connection<00:01:36.420> with

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it's important have a connection with

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's important have a connection with
those<00:01:36.810> people<00:01:37.170> else<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.100> care
