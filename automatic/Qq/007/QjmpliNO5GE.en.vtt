00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
like I said honey is basically full of

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:44.020 
like I said honey is basically full of
antioxidants<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:39.290> anti-aging<00:03:41.930> ingredients

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.060 
antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients
that<00:03:45.030> prevent<00:03:45.570> premature<00:03:47.690> aging<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.079> it's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
that prevent premature aging and it's

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.710 
that prevent premature aging and it's
also<00:03:50.220> filled<00:03:50.519> with<00:03:50.700> potassium<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.480> what

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
also filled with potassium and what

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.349 
also filled with potassium and what
potassium<00:03:52.290> does<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:56.150> doesn't<00:03:57.150> allow

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
potassium does is it doesn't allow

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.960 
potassium does is it doesn't allow
bacteria<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.989> grow<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.739> wherever<00:03:58.980> potassium

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
bacteria to grow so wherever potassium

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.319 
bacteria to grow so wherever potassium
is<00:04:00.180> present<00:04:01.190> bacteria<00:04:02.190> cannot<00:04:02.519> grow<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.269> I

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
is present bacteria cannot grow so I

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.280 
is present bacteria cannot grow so I
want<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.600> give<00:04:03.720> them<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:07.139> that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
want to give them a here on so that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.720 
want to give them a here on so that
means<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.799> even<00:04:07.950> add<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:10.220> banana<00:04:11.220> peel

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
means you can even add in a banana peel

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.780 
means you can even add in a banana peel
to<00:04:12.329> this<00:04:12.480> mixture<00:04:13.069> because<00:04:14.069> banana<00:04:14.370> has<00:04:14.579> lots

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
to this mixture because banana has lots

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.090 
to this mixture because banana has lots
of<00:04:14.940> potassium<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.109> can<00:04:16.260> act<00:04:16.440> as<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
of potassium in it and it can act as a a

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.960 
of potassium in it and it can act as a a
thickening<00:04:18.060> agent<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.729> have<00:04:20.940> a

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
thickening agent so that you have a

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.690 
thickening agent so that you have a
fuller<00:04:21.510> mask

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
fuller mask

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.930 
fuller mask
