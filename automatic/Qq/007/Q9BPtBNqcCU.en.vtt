00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
going into first gear actually goes into

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
going into first gear actually goes into
first<00:00:34.320> gear<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:35.040> goes<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.340> third

first gear but actually goes into third

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
first gear but actually goes into third
gear<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.079> set<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.380> third<00:00:37.590> gear<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.070> going

how it is inside right now there's no
play<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.300> before<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.780> head<00:00:57.870> plague<00:00:58.170> forward

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
play but before we head plague forward

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.540 
play but before we head plague forward
hopes<00:00:59.330> forward<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.570> goes<00:01:00.630> forward<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.290> back

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
hopes forward it goes forward and back

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.660 
hopes forward it goes forward and back
you<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:05.090> these<00:01:06.090> bushings<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.780> here

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
you could see these bushings right here

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.750 
you could see these bushings right here
and<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> car<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.300> filthy

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.460 

I<00:01:11.790> never<00:01:12.390> took<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:13.730> just<00:01:14.730> cover<00:01:15.470> anyways

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I never took this out just cover anyways

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
I never took this out just cover anyways
see<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.220> bushing<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.600> Bush<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.870> worn<00:01:19.200> out

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
see that bushing that Bush is worn out

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
see that bushing that Bush is worn out
and<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.280> bushing<00:01:20.940> here<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.869> well<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> as

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and is also bushing here as well so as

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
and is also bushing here as well so as
that<00:01:25.560> gets<00:01:25.860> worn<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:27.630> has<00:01:27.750> hard<00:01:27.990> time

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that gets worn out it has hard time

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
that gets worn out it has hard time
putting<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:30.920> going<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.190> first<00:01:32.580> gear<00:01:32.850> which

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
putting the going into first gear which

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
putting the going into first gear which
will<00:01:33.690> be<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.800> see<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.160> goes

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will be right here you see how it goes

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
will be right here you see how it goes
and<00:01:35.460> easy<00:01:35.610> before<00:01:36.450> every<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.750> put<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.080> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and easy before every time put it in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
and easy before every time put it in
first<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.619> every<00:01:37.800> time<00:01:38.010> about<00:01:38.420> 50%<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
first not every time about 50% of the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.880 
first not every time about 50% of the
time<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.020> first<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.440> actually<00:01:40.740> go

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
time I put it on first to actually go

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.210 
time I put it on first to actually go
into<00:01:41.160> third<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.690> put<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.930> mighty<00:01:43.170> burst<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
into third and I put a mighty burst and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.570 
into third and I put a mighty burst and
we'll<00:01:44.580> go<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:44.940> first<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.429> nothing

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
we'll go into first so there's nothing

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.400 
we'll go into first so there's nothing
that<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.140> said

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
first I'll find out which gear that is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.770 
first I'll find out which gear that is
but<00:02:21.430> anyways<00:02:23.549> I'll<00:02:24.549> show<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.420> little

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
approximately is 16 and that's 16 you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.050 
approximately is 16 and that's 16 you
can<00:03:58.459> see<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.950> don't<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.549> too<00:04:01.700> much<00:04:01.850> play

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
back to tying this and go for a test

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.650 
back to tying this and go for a test
drive<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:17.959> should<00:04:18.229> fix<00:04:18.410> your<00:04:19.660> first

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
drive and that should fix your first

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
out I don't know we can get that piece

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.950 
out I don't know we can get that piece
yet<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.500> didn't<00:04:30.770> look<00:04:30.830> into<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.729> far<00:04:31.940> I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.249 

I<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:36.370> moved<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.330> Brack<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> little<00:04:37.930> bit<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
I just moved that Brack a little bit and

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:46.260 
I just moved that Brack a little bit and
they<00:04:39.039> seem<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.419> fix<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.570> problem<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:45.150> don't<00:04:46.150> net

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
they seem to fix the problem I don't net

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.949 
they seem to fix the problem I don't net
that's<00:04:46.539> pretty<00:04:47.500> much<00:04:47.680> it
