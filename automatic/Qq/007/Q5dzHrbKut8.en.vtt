00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.879
 hi artem with you today in this video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.910
 I decided to tell you about the top 10 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.300
 jailbreak tweaks for ios 8.3 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.820
 and 8.4 drove the first you we 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 we begin is called svayp slash after 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.160
 installing it on your keyboard and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.320
 gadget 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 100 exactly the same will be added 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 as on the keyboard devices under 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 running ios 9, everything works 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.869
 good enough no worse than seemingly 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.230
 nine stroke with a little jerking 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 me 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.700
 the next trick is called side slices 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.870
 mod after installing it on your 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.030
 devices will appear 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 energy savings in the parameters of this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.570
 tweak you can choose what it will be 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.629
 disable when activated for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.510
 energy saving and what not next 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.399
 the answer is called 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.070
 hidden wolf and pulse after setting it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 setting the settings of dynamic wallpaper a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 you have some new ones added 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 beautiful enough and I still have n't 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 I understand why the apple is still not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 integrated into its new operating 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.420
 system the next type is called occam 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 paradise and after its installation and activation 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.380
 your standard sprint board is being replaced 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 the launcher overlooking the apple watch works 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 well enough the only thing to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 you can find fault 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.220
 this is for the long opening app but in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.460
 The main advantage of the century is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 what is to activate it just 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.549
 need to turn on or off in 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.140
 settings ie respring reboot or 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.390
 something else is not needed 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.560
 the next trick is this kind called and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.090
 a loaf and after its installation and activation 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 you have such a small one 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.650
 circle if we pull it up then 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 We will open the app and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.460
 favorite applications which can be 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.439
 configure in the parameters of this tweak 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 if we pull down then we 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.000
 open the application that is open 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 right now in multitasking also 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.299
 You can change the appearance of this button. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.670
 and so on the next tweak is 100 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.430
 the novel is analogous to oldish century 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.460
 marshmallow and answer called archer after 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.000
 its installation you will be able to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 switch here with such svaypami 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.550
 applications implemented enough 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.500
 cool and comfortable and the next 3 to 3 under 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.600
 name osb tele2 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 immediately apologize if wrong 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.310
 read the name is an analogue tvika 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.600
 applocker after you install it 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.570
 choose an application that will 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.160
 password protected and what is the coolest this 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.420
 lead implemented under the appearance of ios 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 The next tweet is this view called 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.260
 the attic after you install it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.770
 will be able to customize 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.330
 a dog of yours and a gadget add for example 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.770
 a large number of applications 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.860
 as well as a different animation next 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.920
 the trick is analogous to tweak aux a either 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 selling is called control pain for 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.410
 its activation needs a tweak activator and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.180
 after its installation, respectively 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.700
 activation you have this here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.030
 the panel can for example enable it 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.220
 or turn off bluetooth and flashlight 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.950
 adjust the brightness volume level and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.580
 make 2 spray or turn off your 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.500
 device and last tweak today 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.290
 this species called swipe tideless 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.600
 for photo application if you have 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.180
 some album you need fast 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.610
 delete and with photos then you just 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.890
 doing this here winters left and 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.400
 click delete after this album 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.420
 deleted and accordingly you can so 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.500
 do with almost everyone 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.799
 photo albums naturally except 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.510
 Naturally, except for the main ones, this is all about 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.910
