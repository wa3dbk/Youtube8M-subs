something that's kind of expensive and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
something that's kind of expensive and
for<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.700> example<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.270> getting<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
for this example I'm getting into the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
for this example I'm getting into the
adder<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.009> drive<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> garage
