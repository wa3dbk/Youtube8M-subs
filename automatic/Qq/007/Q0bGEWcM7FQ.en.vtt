00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.500
 builders ahrensburg alex we here and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.480
 Today I want to show how to do that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 Successful revival of the cafÃ© where it gets 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 relatively heavy but it is feasible and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 Apart from that I am her grave of spawn 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.130
 from slipped down and immediately after 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.240
 the chalk went right for me 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 the Romans brought to the wall 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 painted and therefore have ever 1000th 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.740
 Points made now it's off to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.330
 care body to jail to the small ones 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 prison and free now first new 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.210
 just get the key and then 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 attach to the lock with iks or 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 catch up 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 and then alcohol gets here to go back 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 rather today runs here through the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 first barrier through while 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 we can go to the general store 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.510
 go and the trample him together 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 Build and all parts we find here 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.160
 in it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.629
 if you know otherwise I know how to do that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 I have a link in the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.469
 description of the playlist of me 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 where all the stuff falls for the dsi here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 are in there and I also show how to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.460
 The trampelst together builds so 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.020
 if you do not know just those 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 look at the description and in the playlist 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.010
 Browse this way every now and then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 We also have a zombie chin and too 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.189
 but let's shoot the foot five times 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.000
 clean and then knead it the maxxi 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.890
 with our point yield and now it goes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.119
 It definitely very important 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.070
 Now you have to look really good 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.840
 which is now our standard, we route 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.950
 Just run back through the barn 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 walk through these mines and walk the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.040
 Olympic continues we are not up 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.780
 the way to the saloon the zombies the that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.460
 born do not kill no zombies first 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.540
 times more killing on this small crib 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.060
 skip here 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.119
 Now we are on is now to go on it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.159
 left to very nice and start 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.570
 take skipping it will not work 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.970
 always so team that is not always 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 and then we go down the stairs 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.799
 down and here we see five weapons 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.720
 I also have the gala kids now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.600
 taken and am with the now again 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.829
 gone to prison 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.270
 Among others, two are in prison 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.740
 question mark to these question marks 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
 We can always do with the chalk 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 Weapons on man receive the company 1000 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.909
 Points 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'm still talk so 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.780
 paint here after we get us 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.750
 the same route again and chalk 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.039
 then it goes back to the prison and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.539
 then we go to the right this time 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 the route you have to go over and over 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.970
 take that can take a long time 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.260
 I think I have 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 Trophy just under a quarter of an hour 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.530
 I definitely need it now 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.030
 First get the second one again 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.830
 1000 points then we take ours 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.500
 standard route from just go though 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
 this time right along the house up 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.890
 and active in the current me if the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 current activates it spurs me one more 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
 alcohol bottle either in the saloon or 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 you have luck of pont um jail 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.870
 So you have to check it out before 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430
 then we'll go with the tramp 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.200
 but jump over to prison 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.990
 Of course, get back chalk before 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 and paint the next part and the gesture 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.630
 Weapon against the wall 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.430
 then it's back to the saloon 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.350
 get us full chalk again and yes 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 then we give up to the saloon here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.820
 paint us there like a wall and the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.250
 next weapon is finished 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.900
 5,000 points then we look once was 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.280
 where the alcohol bottle is me here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.260
 Saloon is curious with me 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.570
 installer have gone in the couch 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.970
 open for 57 points 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.170
 and if you're lucky you have it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.709
 really in prison so full 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.560
 check 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.110
 then we go to the general store 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.270
 Of course, the staircase is in his luggage 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.070
 and go to the church and wait 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.269
 until the people arrive there send 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.630
 rather in the church row with the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.630
 alcohol 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.220
 as soon as the barrier in front of the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.870
 destroyed church then we go to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.430
 barrier next to the sweets layers 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.739
 let us trample him there 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.570
 Wait until the charge is up 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.140
 get over us again in the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.090
 chalk 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.709
 and as soon as we got the chalk 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.140
 it goes down and we look here 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.489
 on the wall between old city and cb 23 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.430
 Years I can only recommend myself 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 The child relatively fast and costs too 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.290
 little and then it goes on in any case 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.790
 our temple semester again 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.019
 That's where we go with channel history 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.489
 down now we have to watch that 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.480
 we also jump to the right place 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 not that we never trample on it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.830
 jump on us in any case 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.440
 The stairs are for him then go first 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.810
 to the church then immediately left the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.100
 upstairs and paint the next weapon 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.650
 we'll get to the wall 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.980
 2000 points for because it's the last weapon 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.570
 is 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.459
 and we should not be enough after that 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.680
 We can still have points 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.900
 a zombie just five times the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.019
 shoot a foot and then a knife 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.380
 you see here equal points we need 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.880
 we have 6250 in total and here I am 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.930
 now enough points once brought the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.120
 zombie killed 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.460
 and yes , there's a fence to the right 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.199
 in the form of the villa with these small ones 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.740
 stone then we wait until they 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:39.690
 fully charged has springer about it 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.270
 and then it goes into the world now 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.280
 in the villa then wait some 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.539
 Ghosts on you over 1000 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.770
 I think I'll deduct points if you agree 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.240
 so you have to touch them once 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.280
 Quick kill quickly before you 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.050
 Touch and the spots are almost always 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.610
 the same here in the bedroom 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.919
 sometimes sports ghost but otherwise 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.940
 Here comes always one comes in 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.729
 fourth gear one 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.470
 and then there is the right one yet has 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.759
 almost touched me and if you are not 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.190
 in ston he goes on the same 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.960
 then we often have them here 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.479
 one and then comes left just yet 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.530
 one of the types too i am here 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.449
 did not move on again so is 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.979
 here's a circular excited then 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.840
 it goes on in any case and then 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.520
 are mostly still really many true 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.259
 really many ghosts afterwards and if 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.639
 you have killed all of them and leaves 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.160
 have touched you then get one more 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.960
 few libre is definitely 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.220
 through the labyrinth to the pk punch 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.470
 machine the labyrinth that is always 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.250
 different each and also changes 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.570
 somehow if you are there once 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.479
 gone through it changes already 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.820
 again the route on relatively fast the 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.880
 Found away by it and in tactical 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.500
 range go down 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.820
 and we already have the packers 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.610
 washing machine but puts the weapon 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.780
 puncher lake and thus we have in round 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.760
 one touched so far becomes water 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.000
 record we get the success you 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.349
 See also ginkgo's awakening 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.729
 it was already synonymous with the video 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.960
 I hope it helped you if so 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.320
 then give him a thumb again 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.669
 above 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.380
 and if you could land new 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.849
 Of course, subscribe to none of the 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.380
 to miss zombie tutorials 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.580
 and yes that's now even from 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.240
 me with the video then we'll see each other 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.240
 see you soon
