hi<00:00:02.879> folks<00:00:03.240> uh<00:00:03.720> I've<00:00:04.710> made<00:00:05.240> experiments<00:00:06.240> with

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
hi folks uh I've made experiments with

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.060

 part of a plastic artificial
so<00:00:51.079> I've<00:00:52.079> taped<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> tail<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.270> low

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so I've taped up the tail of the low

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
so I've taped up the tail of the low
blank<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.969> cutting<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:58.129> like<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
blank just like cutting it like the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.389 
blank just like cutting it like the
prongs<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.600> crown<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.440> band<00:01:02.160> them

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
prongs of the crown and band them

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
prongs of the crown and band them
together<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> cone<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> first

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
together to a cone so this is the first

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
together to a cone so this is the first
prototype<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.960> satisfied<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.920> your

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
prototype I'm not satisfied with your

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
prototype I'm not satisfied with your
day<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> still<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.270> issues<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
day I still have some issues with it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
day I still have some issues with it
which<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.100> mainly<00:01:11.540> buoyancy<00:01:12.540> issues<00:01:12.960> um<00:01:13.340> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
which are mainly buoyancy issues um I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
which are mainly buoyancy issues um I
would<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.030> needed<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> place<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> keel

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
would have needed to place a keel

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.390 
would have needed to place a keel
weights<00:01:17.990> into<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> belly<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.890> didn't<00:01:20.250> do

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
weights into the belly which I didn't do

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.940 
weights into the belly which I didn't do
because<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.509> wasn't<00:01:21.750> sure<00:01:22.110> about<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.710> lower

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
because I wasn't sure about the lower

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.780 
because I wasn't sure about the lower
water<00:01:23.250> buoyant<00:01:23.939> enough<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
water buoyant enough at all so I just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240 
water buoyant enough at all so I just
give<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> show<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> now<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.500> swims<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
give it show you now how it swims it's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.410 
give it show you now how it swims it's
not<00:01:29.460> perfect

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
not perfect

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
not perfect
I<00:01:30.500> have<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> alter<00:01:32.220> some<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.270> I'm

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I have to alter some things on it I'm

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
I have to alter some things on it I'm
gonna<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:34.020> further<00:01:34.920> experiments<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
gonna make further experiments on it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
gonna make further experiments on it
guess<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> place<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> line

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
guess I have to try to place the line

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.090 
guess I have to try to place the line
time<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.570> awkward<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.320> probably<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.720> PVC

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
time more awkward and probably use a PVC

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.910 
time more awkward and probably use a PVC
foam<00:01:44.100> material<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.119> stop<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.750> tube<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.320> gain

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
foam material to stop the tube to gain

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.690 
foam material to stop the tube to gain
more<00:01:47.189> buoyancy<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:48.619> drill<00:01:49.619> holes<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> back

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
more buoyancy or drill holes in the back

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.139 
more buoyancy or drill holes in the back
of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.180> lure<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.680> away<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.149> sinking

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
of the lure to take away a sinking

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.660 
of the lure to take away a sinking
material<00:01:54.750> does<00:01:55.880> get<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:57.210> buoyancy<00:01:57.570> too

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
material does get more buoyancy too

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
material does get more buoyancy too
alright<00:02:01.219> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.299> retrieve<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.110> slow<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
alright if you are retrieve it slow it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.279 
alright if you are retrieve it slow it
swims<00:02:06.049> what<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.380> likely<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> overturn<00:02:09.289> when

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
swims what it's likely to overturn when

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.589 
swims what it's likely to overturn when
you<00:02:10.470> pull<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> faster

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
you pull it faster

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.890 
you pull it faster

tried to alter the lip angle at first
the<00:02:18.920> lip<00:02:19.129> was<00:02:19.370> even<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.969> large<00:02:20.389> I've<00:02:20.840> reduced

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the lip was even a large I've reduced

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.990 
the lip was even a large I've reduced
its<00:02:21.950> size<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:26.629> just<00:02:27.049> meant<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.499> be<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:28.000> simple
