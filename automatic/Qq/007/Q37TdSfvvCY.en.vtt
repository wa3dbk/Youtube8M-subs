for a little while yet again but anyways
in<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> video<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.580> comparing

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
in this video I'm gonna be comparing

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
in this video I'm gonna be comparing
both<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> approach<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.770> Osiris<00:00:17.490> so

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
both the approach in and the Osiris so

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
both the approach in and the Osiris so
both<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> new<00:00:18.240> DLC<00:00:18.720> cars<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.800> ill-gotten

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
both the new DLC cars and the ill-gotten

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.000 
both the new DLC cars and the ill-gotten
gain<00:00:20.609> updates<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.890> through<00:00:22.890> this

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
gain updates now I through this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
gain updates now I through this
comparison<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:24.000> find<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.449> actually

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
comparison I did find some actually

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
comparison I did find some actually
pretty<00:00:25.199> surprising<00:00:25.740> results<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.000> guys

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
pretty surprising results so you guys

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
pretty surprising results so you guys
want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> stick<00:00:27.539> through<00:00:27.720> towards<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> end<00:00:28.619> of

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
want to stick through towards the end of

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
want to stick through towards the end of
the<00:00:28.769> video<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.310> guys<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.480> able<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> see

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the video you guys will be able to see

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
the video you guys will be able to see
that<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.399> without<00:00:32.399> any<00:00:32.579> further<00:00:32.820> ado<00:00:33.000> let's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that and without any further ado let's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
that and without any further ado let's
just<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.690> ahead<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.930> hop<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.950> first

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
just go ahead and hop into this so first

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.380 
just go ahead and hop into this so first
off<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.730> looking<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
off we're going to be looking at the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
off we're going to be looking at the
websites<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> guys<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.100> pro

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
websites and as you guys can see the pro

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.330 
websites and as you guys can see the pro
gent<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.610> 2.2<00:00:39.450> million<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:40.950> zero<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
gent is 2.2 million and it has zero to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.450 
gent is 2.2 million and it has zero to
60<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.000> three<00:00:42.360> seconds<00:00:42.989> flat<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> that's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
60 time of three seconds flat so that's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.630 
60 time of three seconds flat so that's
pretty<00:00:44.640> solid<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> osiris<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.640> 1.95

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pretty solid and the osiris is 1.95

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
pretty solid and the osiris is 1.95
million<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.899> cheaper<00:00:49.379> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
million so it's a little bit cheaper as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
million so it's a little bit cheaper as
a<00:00:49.770> slow<00:00:50.039> acceleration<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> little

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a slow acceleration time put a little

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.630 
a slow acceleration time put a little
bit<00:00:51.539> higher<00:00:51.719> top<00:00:52.110> speed<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.980> looking<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
bit higher top speed so looking at the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.010 
bit higher top speed so looking at the
approach<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> outside<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
approach in from the outside it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
approach in from the outside it
obviously<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.430> nice<00:00:56.760> car

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
obviously looks like a pretty nice car

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
obviously looks like a pretty nice car
now<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> admit<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
now I have to admit that this is one of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
now I have to admit that this is one of
my<00:00:59.039> favorite<00:00:59.399> looking<00:00:59.670> cars<00:00:59.940> probably<00:01:00.300> mainly

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
my favorite looking cars probably mainly

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
my favorite looking cars probably mainly
because<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> new<00:01:01.170> car<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.609> still<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
because it's a new car but it's still a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
because it's a new car but it's still a
very<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.719> looking<00:01:04.019> car<00:01:04.260> nevertheless<00:01:05.010> now

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
very good looking car nevertheless now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
very good looking car nevertheless now
something<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.810> interesting<00:01:07.320> about

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
something a little bit interesting about

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
something a little bit interesting about
these<00:01:07.770> new<00:01:07.830> cars<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.490> buddy<00:01:08.670> Tom<00:01:08.939> told<00:01:09.270> me<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
these new cars my buddy Tom told me is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
these new cars my buddy Tom told me is
that<00:01:10.140> they<00:01:10.350> both<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.650> custom<00:01:11.040> sound<00:01:11.369> effects

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that they both have custom sound effects

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.179 
that they both have custom sound effects
so<00:01:12.060> they're<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.869> reused<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.740> most<00:01:13.979> other

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so they're not reused like most other

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
so they're not reused like most other
cars<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.810> applies<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> Osiris

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
cars and this also applies to the Osiris

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.060 
cars and this also applies to the Osiris
obviously<00:01:17.610> along<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> protein<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
obviously along with the protein and the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.800 
obviously along with the protein and the
Osiris<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:21.090> doors<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.659> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Osiris actually has going doors which is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
Osiris actually has going doors which is
one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> only<00:01:22.170> two<00:01:22.439> cars<00:01:22.710> apart<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
one of only two cars apart from the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
one of only two cars apart from the
Mercedes<00:01:24.509> i'm<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:25.080> sure<00:01:25.200> mercedes<00:01:25.710> going

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
Mercedes i'm pretty sure mercedes going

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
Mercedes i'm pretty sure mercedes going
so<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.970> quote<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> foot<00:01:27.750> i'm

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so don't quote me on that foot i'm

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
so don't quote me on that foot i'm
pretty<00:01:28.170> sure<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.560> right<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.150> yeah<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
pretty sure that's right and yeah so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
pretty sure that's right and yeah so
obviously<00:01:31.350> these<00:01:31.590> two<00:01:31.740> cars<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.490> good

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
obviously these two cars are very good

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.010 
obviously these two cars are very good
looking<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.540> they're<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.439> solid<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.020> let's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
looking and they're very solid so let's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420 
looking and they're very solid so let's
go<00:01:37.170> ahead<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.380> hop<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.009> into<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
go ahead and hop right into the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.600 
go ahead and hop right into the
acceleration<00:01:39.090> test<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
acceleration test and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.280 
acceleration test and
right<00:01:40.730> after<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.060> go<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.420> speed<00:01:41.780> test<00:01:42.020> now

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
right after we go to the speed test now

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.730 
right after we go to the speed test now
as<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.310> guys<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:43.610> see<00:01:43.670> here<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:45.200> proteins<00:01:45.590> on

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
as you guys can see here the proteins on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.110 
as you guys can see here the proteins on
the<00:01:45.800> left<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.190> ice<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> right<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.000> guys

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
the left is ice on the right if you guys

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.900 
the left is ice on the right if you guys
can<00:01:47.390> read<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.400> yeah<00:01:49.400> we're<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.610> going

can read and yeah we're just going

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.060 
can read and yeah we're just going
around<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.240> runway<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.680> guys<00:01:51.830> want

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
around the runway and if you guys want

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.800 
around the runway and if you guys want
to<00:01:52.130> keep<00:01:52.310> your<00:01:52.490> eyes<00:01:52.610> peeled<00:01:52.970> on<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
to keep your eyes peeled on the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.960 
to keep your eyes peeled on the
speedometer<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.770> guys<00:01:54.920> can<00:01:55.100> see<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.730> both

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
speedometer you guys can see that both

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.730 
speedometer you guys can see that both
these<00:01:56.210> cars<00:01:56.450> are<00:01:56.750> almost<00:01:57.410> one<00:01:57.680> hundred

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
these cars are almost one hundred

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
these cars are almost one hundred
percent<00:01:57.920> neck<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.580> neck<00:01:58.729> with<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.000> Osiris

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
percent neck and neck with the Osiris

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.960 
percent neck and neck with the Osiris
having<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.290> slight<00:02:00.830> edge<00:02:01.010> on<00:02:01.400> acceleration

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
having a slight edge on acceleration

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.060 
having a slight edge on acceleration
barely<00:02:02.540> barely<00:02:02.690> noticeable<00:02:03.260> however<00:02:03.710> now

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
barely barely noticeable however now

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.560 
barely barely noticeable however now
going<00:02:04.430> into<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.110> actual<00:02:06.110> race<00:02:06.380> itself<00:02:07.570> your

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
going into the actual race itself your

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.419 
going into the actual race itself your
guys<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> see<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.920> results

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
guys are going to see that the results

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.650 
guys are going to see that the results
from<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> acceleration<00:02:11.150> test<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.600> to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
from the acceleration test is going to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.710 
from the acceleration test is going to
be<00:02:11.810> pretty<00:02:12.620> reflecting<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.090> results<00:02:14.600> of

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
be pretty reflecting on the results of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.380 
be pretty reflecting on the results of
the<00:02:15.020> speed<00:02:15.320> tests<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.300> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the speed tests so that's kind of a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.449 
the speed tests so that's kind of a
little<00:02:17.570> bit<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.959> giveaway<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:19.010> we're<00:02:19.430> just

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
little bit of a giveaway but we're just

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.650 
little bit of a giveaway but we're just
going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.730> race<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.150> way<00:02:20.239> down<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
going to race all the way down the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.410 
going to race all the way down the
runway<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.850> couple<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.150> seconds

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
runway here and in a couple of seconds

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.360 
runway here and in a couple of seconds
here<00:02:23.480> I'm<00:02:23.720> actually<00:02:23.900> get<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> slow<00:02:24.560> moment<00:02:24.860> down

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
here I'm actually get a slow moment down

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.690 
here I'm actually get a slow moment down
now<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.060> reason<00:02:26.330> for<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.870> because<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
now the reason for this is because it is

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.930 
now the reason for this is because it is
very<00:02:29.330> very<00:02:29.680> close<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.010> as<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.610> guys<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.880> see

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
very very close so as you guys can see

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.280 
very very close so as you guys can see
here<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.390> looks<00:02:32.570> pretty<00:02:32.720> much<00:02:32.959> neck-and-neck

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
here it looks pretty much neck-and-neck

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.229 
here it looks pretty much neck-and-neck
the<00:02:33.860> Osiris<00:02:34.280> has<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.760> bit<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.030> lead

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the Osiris has a little bit of a lead

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.490 
the Osiris has a little bit of a lead
and<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.260> Osiris<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:37.010> gonna<00:02:37.430> win<00:02:38.200> by<00:02:39.200> four

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and the Osiris is gonna win by four

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.320 
and the Osiris is gonna win by four
frames<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.989> in<00:02:41.989> general<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:43.160> really<00:02:43.790> not

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
frames so in general it's really not

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.780 
frames so in general it's really not
gonna<00:02:44.780> matter<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.440> using<00:02:46.160> both<00:02:46.370> these<00:02:46.549> cars

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
gonna matter and using both these cars

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.120 
gonna matter and using both these cars
is<00:02:47.060> gonna<00:02:47.690> pretty<00:02:47.989> much<00:02:48.110> give<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.680> exact

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
is gonna pretty much give you the exact

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.940 
is gonna pretty much give you the exact
same<00:02:49.430> speed<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.450> Osiris<00:02:50.989> might<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> tiny

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
same speed the Osiris might have a tiny

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.460 
same speed the Osiris might have a tiny
bit<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.489> an<00:02:52.580> edge<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.090> long<00:02:53.630> distance<00:02:53.900> but

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
bit of an edge and long distance but

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.920 
bit of an edge and long distance but
other<00:02:54.950> than<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:56.180> guys<00:02:56.330> are<00:02:56.630> just<00:02:56.810> gonna

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
other than that you guys are just gonna

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.509 
other than that you guys are just gonna
pretty<00:02:57.230> much<00:02:57.320> want<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.739> choose<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:57.980> car<00:02:58.310> based

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
pretty much want to choose the car based

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.250 
pretty much want to choose the car based
on<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> looks<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.269> how<00:02:59.720> much<00:02:59.870> money<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.230> want

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
on the looks and how much money you want

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.170 
on the looks and how much money you want
to<00:03:00.440> spend<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.340> something<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.790> found<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.060> little

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
to spend so something I found a little

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.840 
to spend so something I found a little
bit<00:03:02.360> interesting<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.280> both<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.459> entity

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
bit interesting is that both the entity

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.780 
bit interesting is that both the entity
XF<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.630> zentorno<00:03:06.019> are<00:03:06.410> faster<00:03:07.400> than<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
XF and the zentorno are faster than the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.440 
XF and the zentorno are faster than the
progeny<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.600> Osiris<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:11.090> kind<00:03:11.360> of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
progeny and the Osiris so this kind of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.509 
progeny and the Osiris so this kind of
says<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.650> know<00:03:12.769> if<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.100> guys<00:03:13.250> want<00:03:13.489> a

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
says that you know if you guys want a

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.340 
says that you know if you guys want a
fast<00:03:13.730> car<00:03:13.970> I'd<00:03:14.239> recommend<00:03:14.600> sticking<00:03:14.930> with<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
fast car I'd recommend sticking with the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.710 
fast car I'd recommend sticking with the
entity<00:03:15.680> XF<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.790> zentorno<00:03:17.150> even<00:03:17.600> though

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
entity XF and the zentorno even though

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960 
entity XF and the zentorno even though
the<00:03:17.989> new<00:03:18.140> cars<00:03:18.380> are<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.830> cool<00:03:19.100> looking<00:03:19.280> so

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the new cars are very cool looking so

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.580 
the new cars are very cool looking so
