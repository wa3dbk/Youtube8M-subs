area<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.430> then<00:02:07.270> these<00:02:07.720> cells<00:02:08.170> are<00:02:08.440> isolated

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
area and then these cells are isolated

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.310 
area and then these cells are isolated
and<00:02:09.460> extracted<00:02:10.240> from<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.540> blood<00:02:10.810> vessels

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
and extracted from the blood vessels

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.130 
and extracted from the blood vessels
around<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.860> fact<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:13.120> interesting<00:02:13.630> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
around the fact it's interesting that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.130 
around the fact it's interesting that
most<00:02:14.530> people<00:02:14.800> don't<00:02:14.920> realize<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:16.570> fat

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
most people don't realize that the fat

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
most people don't realize that the fat
tissue<00:02:18.030> harbors<00:02:19.030> more<00:02:19.780> stem<00:02:20.200> cells<00:02:20.560> than<00:02:20.830> any

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
tissue harbors more stem cells than any

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.760 
tissue harbors more stem cells than any
other<00:02:21.400> organ<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.180> body<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:23.110> loaded<00:02:23.740> with

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
other organ in the body it's loaded with

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.860 
other organ in the body it's loaded with
stem<00:02:24.070> cell<00:02:24.340> has<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:25.150> than<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> bone<00:02:25.630> marrow

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
stem cell has more than the bone marrow

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.680 
stem cell has more than the bone marrow
and<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.220> these<00:02:27.490> are<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> cells<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.450> get

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
and so these are the cells that we get

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.440 
and so these are the cells that we get
they<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.620> stem<00:02:29.830> cells<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.190> fact<00:02:30.460> they're

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
they just the stem cells in fact they're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.510 
they just the stem cells in fact they're
not<00:02:31.750> active<00:02:32.260> they've<00:02:32.830> been<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.250> vacation

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
not active they've been on vacation

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120 
not active they've been on vacation
their<00:02:34.300> entire<00:02:34.690> life<00:02:35.020> we<00:02:35.350> got<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:35.860> them<00:02:36.010> out

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
their entire life we got to get them out

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160 
their entire life we got to get them out
and<00:02:36.190> put<00:02:36.610> them<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.180> work<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.720> most<00:02:38.080> people

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
and put them to work and most people

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.680 
and put them to work and most people
have<00:02:38.470> enough<00:02:38.710> oh<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.940> plenty<00:02:40.210> and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
have enough oh they have plenty and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.360 
have enough oh they have plenty and
they'll<00:02:40.900> make<00:02:40.930> more<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> really<00:02:42.160> want<00:02:42.310> to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.500 
they'll make more so I really want to
make<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.580> clear<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:42.970> viewers<00:02:43.240> today

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
happiest plants total hips now look I've

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.900 
happiest plants total hips now look I've
had<00:03:29.500> some<00:03:29.680> training<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.040> orthopedics<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.730> would

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
had some training in orthopedics I would

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.640 
had some training in orthopedics I would
never<00:03:31.239> criticize<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> totally<00:03:32.260> if<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.470> think

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
never criticize a totally if I think

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.350 
never criticize a totally if I think
it's<00:03:32.739> one<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> best<00:03:33.190> operations<00:03:33.850> that

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
it's one of the best operations that

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's one of the best operations that
he's<00:03:34.480> been<00:03:34.660> devised<00:03:35.019> there<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.380> long<00:03:35.769> time<00:03:36.070> but

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
he's been devised there a long time but

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.479 
he's been devised there a long time but
here's<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.630> guy<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.050> was<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.739> doc<00:03:39.040> said<00:03:39.280> look

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
here's a guy that was the doc said look

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.220 
here's a guy that was the doc said look
we've<00:03:40.000> done<00:03:40.150> everything<00:03:40.360> we<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.720> you'll<00:03:41.110> need

operations he said well I want to know
something<00:03:43.450> else<00:03:43.600> he<00:03:43.989> went<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.230> did<00:03:44.350> stem

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
something else he went and did stem

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.910 
something else he went and did stem
cells<00:03:44.890> now<00:03:45.670> he's<00:03:45.910> able<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.209> walk<00:03:46.510> he's<00:03:47.260> able<00:03:47.470> to

you<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.050> they<00:04:28.440> may<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.830> another<00:04:29.130> one<00:04:29.340> in<00:04:29.490> a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
you know they may want another one in a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.370 
you know they may want another one in a
year<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> half<00:04:30.150> something<00:04:30.660> like<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.080> what

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
year and a half something like that what

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.629 
year and a half something like that what
do<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.500> know<00:04:31.650> another<00:04:31.860> thing<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.280> people

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
do you know another thing that people

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.430 
do you know another thing that people
ask<00:04:33.150> me<00:04:33.360> about<00:04:33.479> all<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.930> time<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.320> my

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
ask me about all the time and my

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.430 
ask me about all the time and my
practice<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.040> if<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.699> use<00:04:35.729> stem<00:04:36.150> cells<00:04:36.419> as<00:04:37.139> you

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
practice is if you use stem cells as you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.100 
practice is if you use stem cells as you
use<00:04:37.680> them<00:04:38.000> do<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.270> use<00:04:39.389> any<00:04:39.540> drugs<00:04:39.750> or

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
use them do you have to use any drugs or

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.560 
use them do you have to use any drugs or
actually<00:04:40.710> people<00:04:41.160> can<00:04:41.460> decrease<00:04:42.000> drugs<00:04:42.389> they

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
actually people can decrease drugs they

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.510 
actually people can decrease drugs they
take<00:04:42.810> for<00:04:43.020> pain<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.740> they're<00:04:43.979> using<00:04:44.280> story

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
take for pain of if they're using story

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.260 
take for pain of if they're using story
that<00:04:45.210> there's<00:04:45.540> no<00:04:45.840> drugs<00:04:46.260> required<00:04:47.090> for<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that there's no drugs required for the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.500 
that there's no drugs required for the
surgery<00:04:48.750> or<00:04:48.960> for<00:04:49.560> except<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.979> go<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.100> sleep<00:04:50.510> or

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
surgery or for except to go to sleep or

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.379 
surgery or for except to go to sleep or
as<00:04:52.289> a<00:04:52.350> part<00:04:52.889> of<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.070> stem<00:04:53.280> cell<00:04:53.490> treatment<00:04:54.000> you

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
as a part of the stem cell treatment you

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.120 
as a part of the stem cell treatment you
may<00:04:54.510> have<00:04:54.690> some<00:04:54.930> for<00:04:55.139> pain<00:04:55.350> afterwards<00:04:56.010> you

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
may have some for pain afterwards you

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.350 
may have some for pain afterwards you
know<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.400> couple<00:04:56.460> days<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.720> in<00:04:58.320> general<00:04:58.800> it

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
know a couple days but in general it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.140 
know a couple days but in general it
causes<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.630> benefit<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.729> create<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.970> you

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
causes the benefit to create that you

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.300 
causes the benefit to create that you
don't<00:05:03.389> need<00:05:03.660> any<00:05:03.930> more<00:05:04.139> drugs<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.800> that's

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
don't need any more drugs and that's

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
don't need any more drugs and that's
what's<00:05:05.610> good<00:05:05.880> where<00:05:06.240> they<00:05:06.810> actually<00:05:07.020> feeling

average that's not the purpose but a
mini<00:06:08.310> liposuction<00:06:09.120> then<00:06:09.750> we<00:06:10.020> hydrolyze<00:06:10.889> the

mini liposuction then we hydrolyze the

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.960 
mini liposuction then we hydrolyze the
fat<00:06:11.639> we<00:06:12.410> isolate<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.560> stem<00:06:13.800> cells<00:06:14.130> we<00:06:14.699> put

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
fat we isolate the stem cells we put

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.870 
fat we isolate the stem cells we put
them<00:06:15.090> back<00:06:15.360> into<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:16.050> solution<00:06:16.830> we<00:06:17.430> eat<00:06:17.669> them<00:06:17.820> up

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
them back into a solution we eat them up

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.180 
them back into a solution we eat them up
a<00:06:18.000> little<00:06:18.030> bit<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:19.289> then<00:06:19.349> we<00:06:19.650> inject<00:06:20.039> them

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
a little bit and then we inject them

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.400 
a little bit and then we inject them
back<00:06:20.340> into<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.789> system<00:06:20.970> it's<00:06:21.360> their<00:06:21.840> cells

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
back into the system it's their cells

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.890 
back into the system it's their cells
and<00:06:22.830> we<00:06:23.699> tell<00:06:23.940> those<00:06:24.120> stem<00:06:24.330> cell<00:06:24.539> before<00:06:24.719> we

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
and we tell those stem cell before we

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.290 
and we tell those stem cell before we
put<00:06:25.080> them<00:06:25.169> back<00:06:25.260> in<00:06:25.440> and<00:06:25.500> say<00:06:25.590> okay<00:06:26.099> guys<00:06:26.310> go<00:06:27.240> to
