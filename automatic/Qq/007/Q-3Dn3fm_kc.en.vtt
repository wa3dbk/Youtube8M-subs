that that is definitely possible there's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.830 
that that is definitely possible there's
a<00:00:16.260> lot<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> barriers<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.400> there's

a lot of barriers to it there's

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.900 
a lot of barriers to it there's
different<00:00:18.840> mechanisms<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.619> cells<00:00:19.920> where

with one answer if you pick another gene

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
with one answer if you pick another gene
you<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> different<00:01:53.220> tree<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.659> and

you get a different tree if you try and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
you get a different tree if you try and
look<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> genome<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> whole<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.280> a

look at the genome as a whole you get a

I was<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> marsupial<00:02:15.180> versus<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
I was in the marsupial versus you know a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.230 
I was in the marsupial versus you know a
platypus<00:02:18.800> genome<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.730> would<00:02:20.880> definitely

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
platypus genome you would definitely

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.710 
platypus genome you would definitely
find<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.900> clear-cut<00:02:22.640> similarity<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.420> we

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
find a clear-cut similarity if we

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.540 
find a clear-cut similarity if we
sequenced<00:02:25.110> another<00:02:25.560> mammalian<00:02:26.070> genome<00:02:26.400> we

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
sequenced another mammalian genome we

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.510 
sequenced another mammalian genome we
would<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.850> discover<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.450> single<00:02:27.960> new<00:02:28.140> gene<00:02:28.520> we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
would not discover a single new gene we

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610 
would not discover a single new gene we
would<00:02:29.700> discover<00:02:30.090> unique<00:02:30.530> combinations<00:02:31.530> that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
would discover unique combinations that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.940 
would discover unique combinations that
made<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.190> mammal<00:02:32.700> versus<00:02:33.480> us<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.680> have

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
made that mammal versus us but we have

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.300 
made that mammal versus us but we have
saturated<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> gene<00:02:36.060> set<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.750> mammals<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.100> we

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
saturated the gene set for mammals so we

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.480 
saturated the gene set for mammals so we
can<00:02:38.790> print<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.390> say<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.110> they<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:41.190> gene

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
can print out and say but they that gene

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.150 
can print out and say but they that gene
set<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.880> mammals<00:02:42.470> over<00:02:43.470> half<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.890> those<00:02:44.100> are

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
set of mammals over half of those are

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.420 
set of mammals over half of those are
shared<00:02:44.700> broadly<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.900> other<00:02:46.080> species<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
shared broadly with other species so you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.580 
shared broadly with other species so you
can't<00:02:47.730> draw<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.420> bright<00:02:48.630> line<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.200> every<00:02:49.410> gene

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
can't draw a bright line and every gene

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.380 
can't draw a bright line and every gene
and<00:02:49.740> say<00:02:49.890> these<00:02:50.250> are<00:02:50.490> plants<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.210> are

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and say these are plants and these are

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.660 
and say these are plants and these are
mammals<00:02:51.720> these<00:02:52.500> are<00:02:52.740> humans<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.490> are

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
mammals these are humans and these are

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.960 
mammals these are humans and these are
marsupials<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:55.290> we've<00:02:55.470> used<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.790> gets

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
marsupials because we've used it gets

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
marsupials because we've used it gets
back<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.330> gene<00:02:57.630> centric<00:02:58.080> view<00:02:58.110> we've<00:02:58.530> used

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
back to the gene centric view we've used

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.420 
back to the gene centric view we've used
those<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.390> random<00:03:00.900> design<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.650> biology<00:03:02.220> as

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
those in the random design of biology as

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150 
those in the random design of biology as
we<00:03:03.420> will<00:03:03.630> use<00:03:03.780> them<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> very<00:03:04.470> specific

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
we will use them in the very specific

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.660 
we will use them in the very specific
design<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:06.240> we<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> laboratory<00:03:06.960> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
design that we do in the laboratory and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.030 
design that we do in the laboratory and
so<00:03:08.670> taxonomy<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.900> something<00:03:10.470> where<00:03:10.710> people

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
so taxonomy is something where people

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.940 
so taxonomy is something where people
sort<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.090> fool<00:03:12.300> themselves<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:13.290> justifying

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
sort of fool themselves of justifying

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.790 
sort of fool themselves of justifying
what<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:14.730> their<00:03:14.790> visual<00:03:15.240> acuity

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
what they see with their visual acuity

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.260 
what they see with their visual acuity
so<00:03:16.800> when<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.130> look<00:03:17.310> at<00:03:17.490> bacterial<00:03:18.200> evolution<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
so when we look at bacterial evolution a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.760 
so when we look at bacterial evolution a
typical<00:03:21.270> bacteria<00:03:21.750> will<00:03:21.900> have<00:03:22.050> two<00:03:22.290> thousand

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
typical bacteria will have two thousand

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.980 
typical bacteria will have two thousand
genes<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.370> each<00:03:24.240> one<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:24.750> two

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
genes in it each one of those two

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.040 
genes in it each one of those two
thousand<00:03:25.410> genes<00:03:25.680> has<00:03:26.130> its<00:03:26.580> own<00:03:27.050> separate

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
thousand genes has its own separate

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.870 
thousand genes has its own separate
evolutionary<00:03:28.680> tree<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.490> construct

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
evolutionary tree that you can construct

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.600 
evolutionary tree that you can construct
and<00:03:30.390> none<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.110> them<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:32.040> same<00:03:32.250> timeline

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
and none of them have the same timeline

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.870 
and none of them have the same timeline
that<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.630> could<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:33.990> together<00:03:34.459> area<00:03:35.459> but

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that you could put together area but

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.510 
that you could put together area but
that's<00:03:36.060> bacteria<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.010> viruses<00:03:38.010> pick<00:03:38.340> up

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
that's bacteria so viruses pick up

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.580 
that's bacteria so viruses pick up
bacterial<00:03:39.090> genes<00:03:39.420> all<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.959> time<00:03:40.140> they<00:03:40.380> pick

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
bacterial genes all the time they pick

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.220 
bacterial genes all the time they pick
up<00:03:40.709> mammalian<00:03:41.340> genes<00:03:41.610> all<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.030> time<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.480> third

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
up mammalian genes all the time a third

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.530 
up mammalian genes all the time a third
of<00:03:43.380> your<00:03:43.650> genome<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.340> virus<00:03:44.760> it's<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.300> just

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
of your genome is virus it's not just

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.040 
of your genome is virus it's not just
you<00:03:45.630> personally<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.800> us<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.160> that

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
you personally it's all of us have that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.380 
you personally it's all of us have that
and<00:03:49.250> there<00:03:50.250> are<00:03:50.370> subtle<00:03:50.700> differences<00:03:50.910> in

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and there are subtle differences in

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.490 
and there are subtle differences in
those<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.620> if<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:54.080> taxonomist<00:03:55.080> was<00:03:55.320> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
those that if a taxonomist was to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.710 
those that if a taxonomist was to
measure<00:03:55.709> viral<00:03:56.400> genes<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:57.120> mistakenly

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
measure viral genes on mistakenly

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.380 
measure viral genes on mistakenly
thinking<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.770> was<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> human<00:03:59.340> gene<00:03:59.550> they<00:04:00.209> would

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
thinking it was a human gene they would

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.850 
thinking it was a human gene they would
come<00:04:00.570> up<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.870> very<00:04:01.110> different<00:04:01.560> answer

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
come up with a very different answer

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.160 
come up with a very different answer
than<00:04:02.130> one<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.000> was<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.480> human<00:04:03.810> lineage

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
than one that was in the human lineage

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.830 
than one that was in the human lineage
perhaps<00:04:04.920> from<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.250> beginning<00:04:05.780> aren't<00:04:06.780> we

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
perhaps from the beginning aren't we

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.790 
perhaps from the beginning aren't we
really<00:04:07.200> dependent<00:04:07.770> on<00:04:08.870> for<00:04:09.870> our<00:04:10.020> life<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.650> have

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
really dependent on for our life to have

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.830 
really dependent on for our life to have
a<00:04:10.830> lot<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.070> animal<00:04:11.670> cells<00:04:11.910> in<00:04:12.060> our<00:04:12.120> body<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.450> in

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
a lot of animal cells in our body and in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.920 
a lot of animal cells in our body and in
essence<00:04:13.320> are<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.770> human<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.489> zoo

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
essence are we not a human but a zoo

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.120 
essence are we not a human but a zoo
well<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.049> depends<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:16.890> for

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
well it depends of what you have for

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.620 
well it depends of what you have for
breakfast<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.760> we<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> hundred<00:04:21.239> trillion

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
breakfast so we have a hundred trillion

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.410 
breakfast so we have a hundred trillion
human<00:04:22.200> cells

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
human cells

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.860 
human cells
we<00:04:23.960> have<00:04:24.260> at<00:04:24.650> least<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.700> many<00:04:26.000> bacterial

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
we have at least that many bacterial

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.590 
we have at least that many bacterial
cells<00:04:27.200> associated<00:04:27.740> with<00:04:28.280> us<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:28.790> so<00:04:29.330> we<00:04:29.450> are<00:04:29.570> a

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
cells associated with us so so we are a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.550 
cells associated with us so so we are a
zoo<00:04:29.930> well<00:04:30.500> where<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:32.300> depends<00:04:32.690> there's<00:04:33.440> not

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
zoo well where it depends there's not

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.490 
zoo well where it depends there's not
too<00:04:33.710> many<00:04:33.800> bacterial<00:04:34.520> zoos<00:04:35.140> but<00:04:36.140> but<00:04:36.350> an

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
too many bacterial zoos but but an

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.250 
too many bacterial zoos but but an
important<00:04:37.010> part<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.520> human<00:04:38.030> metabolism<00:04:38.420> human

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
important part of human metabolism human

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.210 
important part of human metabolism human
diet<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:40.300> you're<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.480> so<00:04:41.780> much<00:04:42.080> what<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.920> eat

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
diet is you're not so much what you eat

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.390 
diet is you're not so much what you eat
as<00:04:44.030> people<00:04:44.450> say<00:04:44.660> you're<00:04:45.530> what<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:45.950> feed<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
as people say you're what you feed the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.370 
as people say you're what you feed the
bacteria<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:47.060> your<00:04:47.180> gut<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.780> when<00:04:47.930> we<00:04:48.050> look<00:04:48.200> at

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
bacteria in your gut so when we look at

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.410 
bacteria in your gut so when we look at
the<00:04:48.500> chemicals<00:04:48.980> in<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.250> blood<00:04:49.400> after<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.970> meal

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
the chemicals in the blood after a meal

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.200 
the chemicals in the blood after a meal
there's<00:04:51.140> roughly<00:04:51.410> 2,500<00:04:52.340> compounds<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.030> we

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
there's roughly 2,500 compounds that we

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.290 
there's roughly 2,500 compounds that we
as<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.390> species<00:04:53.750> can<00:04:54.140> make<00:04:54.700> we<00:04:55.700> see<00:04:55.910> roughly

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
as a species can make we see roughly

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.810 
as a species can make we see roughly
twice<00:04:56.660> that<00:04:56.990> many<00:04:57.200> as<00:04:57.470> bacterial<00:04:58.130> metabolites

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
twice that many as bacterial metabolites

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.400 
twice that many as bacterial metabolites
in<00:04:59.180> our<00:04:59.870> guts<00:05:00.110> from<00:05:00.530> what<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:01.460> feed<00:05:01.790> them<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:02.410> we

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
in our guts from what we feed them so we

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.010 
in our guts from what we feed them so we
live<00:05:03.770> in<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.190> bacterial<00:05:04.790> milieu<00:05:05.180> we<00:05:05.450> breathe<00:05:05.750> it

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
live in a bacterial milieu we breathe it

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
our guts every orifice our skin we have

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.800 
our guts every orifice our skin we have
more<00:05:10.070> bacterial<00:05:10.670> cells<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.180> we<00:05:11.270> have<00:05:11.450> human

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
more bacterial cells and we have human

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.220 
more bacterial cells and we have human
cells<00:05:12.050> in<00:05:12.410> there<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.100> very<00:05:14.060> key<00:05:14.390> part<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.960> our

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230
