00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.630
 President delighted to greet 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.800
 equally well ok very well 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.560
 maybe now because there's no football 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 we are calmer really good 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 now let's go let's start this magazine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 talking a little about you you came to the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 real madrid in the year 2000 justly 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.579
 madrid was not exactly a club 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.220
 profitable what has been your strategy for 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.320
 to locate the real madrid today 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.890
 according to the forbes list as the club the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.890
 number one 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 Well, look at the year 2000 when I 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.530
 I come here, I come to a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.270
 situation 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.850
 very bad from the point of view 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.489
 economic good so bad that we ran 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 the risk that the partners that we 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.079
 we are the owners of the club 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.370
 we lost that condition and well then 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.560
 I come to contribute my experience 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.299
 business for what 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.320
 we will recover that economic stability 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.060
 what is it that allows us to be 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.009
 independent and owners of our club 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 I remember that when I came here I 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.119
 they said that you had to sell to roberto 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 carlos a raúl who were the figures that 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.200
 we had at that time to do 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 in front of the debts and I said not everything 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.760
 what we have to do is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.190
 bring the best players to the best 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.860
 of the world following the story he made 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.909
 bernabéu with di stéfano with you are looking for 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.110
 people and let's say to increase the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 income and that 's what we did 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.149
 we brought fiba city to ronaldo and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.240
 beckham and we went to enter 100 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.610
 million euros and enter 350 and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.369
 we went to lose and win from the point 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.940
 of personal view and liked in all 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.610
 the senses 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.270
 good in the first time all were 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.850
 good let's say zidane was a player of 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.610
 those that still on the street 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.740
 congratulate for having seen the city play 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.300
 in the bernabéu and now without any type 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.700
 of Christian doubt that I believe is the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.560
 best in the world and that is also 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.420
 still to come that the plant what 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.850
 better told you in an interview I think that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.370
 Ronaldo will retire in Madrid and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.080
 question is really Christian wants 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 retire in Madrid and I ask him 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.830
 how are the negotiations for the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.100
 completion we're talking about I think the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.590
 Once you grow to be sincere in this subject 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.080
 is that ronaldo who wants to retire 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.820
 in Madrid informing and Real Madrid 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.970
 wants people to retire in madrid then 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.140
 therefore there have been no negotiations 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.710
 has gone from gone on vacation 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.440
 will come back and have not I have said so many 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.000
 times that maybe I do not believe have the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.460
 absolute security that a ronaldo 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 they separate the real madrid and good no but 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.220
 not because the real Madrid wants it but because 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.700
 because he wants it like he retired 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.040
 city as they retired so many 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.820
 great players 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.890
 that is, what are the chances that the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.930
 season after a thousand dances that's a 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.630
 magnificent player who is in a club 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.130
 friend is the tottenham and that we do not 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.600
 we have still talked with the club and the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.120
 day we 're going to talk to the club what 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.740
 first thing we will do is call you to 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660
 say that we have or do not have in 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.600
 three but no, we have not done it yet 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.280
 nothing would have done nothing to them in the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 You are planning to sign Luis 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.040
 Suarez 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.680
 here as I tell you the services 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.170
 technicians have been analyzing many 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.569
 players but there has not been any type 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.220
 of relationship with anyone regarding 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.159
 visuals or of many others who have 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.480
 out and of cavani also never in the 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.120
 lifetime 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.790
 and one day I also read about the father who had 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.250
 in madrid an offer towards the whole 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.200
 by the father but it is not true is a 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.900
 great player but they put us 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.430
 always in relation to madrid there is 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.200
 many players who then do not 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.989
 they correspond with good gravity since 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.579
 to conclude the issue of the signings 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.349
 it's clearly a football that you like the 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.720
 oslo but I see also in 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.849
 newspapers but lately but hey 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.620
 let's say for sure it is one of the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.349
 options that the body is shuffling 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.230
 technical but let's say you have not yet 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.299
 there was no contact and if some day 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.709
 there has to be some contact so what 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.910
 first thing we will do is talk to the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.560
 President 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.970
 the society that is friend as was 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.420
 mourinho really in the distances 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.250
 short how would you define it good to 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.970
 personal level is a person 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.450
 lovely charming completely 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.860
 normal and that sure would love the 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.690
 person to your interlocutor 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.240
 if you talk to put yourself would be 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.850
 sure impressed how is it like 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.910
 person on the subject let's say professional 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.150
 is a man of extreme demand or 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.100
 be me to say almost in terror more 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.990
 demanding I've seen with his players 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.360
 really at what time in the season 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.340
 mourinho told him this look president 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.200
 really I can not anymore with this no 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.540
 wants to follow more no no I believe that 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.090
 until the end in the fight as if it were 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.900
 to be here all my life 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.699
 and well our ending was a little bit 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.830
 bad luck because the end of the cup 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.800
 King everyone knows that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.850
 We lost without losing it 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.940
 we lost against borussia that I the 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.860
 I respect a lot but Borussia in the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.740
 semifinal of the European Cup should not 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.080
 to have won Real Madrid and well then 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.910
 at the end of those two parties conditions 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.470
 too much and I think there will 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.970
 it conditioned much the 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.740
 when you go down the street and see the 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.410
 stadium says good is that this stadium 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.930
 it can not be from an uncle or two or from 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.930
 three this has to be from all 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.850
 and this story of 111 years of having 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.280
 worked for all this to be of 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.080
 all of me sometimes I say it's heritage 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.240
 of humanity but those who are angry 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.130
 Madrid are not then say 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.380
 bigger arrogance but it's true I 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.820
 I see all this I say this can not be me 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.610
 I had the opportunity to make it mine 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.770
 when I entered the year 2000 instead of 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.230
 endorse for them for the calculation could 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.960
 I did not do it for me, but it's just that I 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.840
 it would be brothers I went to the opposite to 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.940
 Alava because I went to the opposite 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.010
 keep guaranteeing the real madrid is going to 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.170
 be your partners all your life and that's 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.150
 a pride that we have the partners and that 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.800
 maybe we hit a little bit 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.570
 of that arrogance because we 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.090
 we consider as I say heirs of 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.740
 that story that many of them do not 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.060
 they have not seen it more than in the cinema the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.220
 stefan law in the same way as 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.630
 that the oldest but already the but 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.870
 how this is inherited from parents 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.880
 this feeling I cried when the 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.570
 manchester united us here was not eliminated 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.340
 once in the bernabéu are you 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.960
 the little flag a child then now 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.430
 they cry they sure have cried some 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.670
 so Borussia's not going to 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.230
 cry and that is a sadness that I 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.600
 I'm just telling players to think about what 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.240
 every time we lose they cry 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.610
 many children of the world not but at the same time 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.130
 it is doing as I said 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.140
 feeling bigger and bigger and 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.840
 good and his things and more thanks for 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.730
 have received us very interesting and very 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.020
 nice thank you very much for having us 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.020
 but nothing thank you very much
