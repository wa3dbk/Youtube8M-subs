00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
now i was just a my mob trap probably

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.060 
now i was just a my mob trap probably
collecting<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.200> mobs<00:02:01.409> last<00:02:01.680> time<00:02:01.829> i<00:02:01.890> logged

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
collecting some mobs last time i logged

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
collecting some mobs last time i logged
off<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.880> letting<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> notice<00:02:03.509> knew<00:02:03.719> about

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
off and letting you notice knew about

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.469 
off and letting you notice knew about
survival<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> hearts<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.090> top

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
survival is the hearts are in the top

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.740 
survival is the hearts are in the top
left<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.590> screen<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.479> lot

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
left of the screen now which is a lot

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.199 
left of the screen now which is a lot
easier<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.400> this<00:02:11.400> could<00:02:11.610> mean<00:02:11.849> their<00:02:12.090> ID

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
easier because this could mean their ID

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.090 
easier because this could mean their ID
name<00:02:12.510> armor<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.379> now<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
name armor because now the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760 
name armor because now the
got<00:02:14.190> an<00:02:14.280> arm<00:02:14.430> around<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.910> bottom<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.680> even<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
got an arm around the bottom and even a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.580 
got an arm around the bottom and even a
possibly<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.340> food<00:02:17.610> bar<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.480> only<00:02:18.750> so

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
possibly a food bar but only so

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.830 
possibly a food bar but only so
extremely<00:02:20.220> cool<00:02:20.490> if<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.270> happened

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
extremely cool if that happened

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.330 
extremely cool if that happened
eventually<00:02:21.930> they've<00:02:22.620> actually<00:02:22.740> increased

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
eventually they've actually increased

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.430 
eventually they've actually increased
the<00:02:23.520> air<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.240> said<00:02:24.690> produced<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> Frog

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
blocks you can like obtain some are

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.880 
blocks you can like obtain some are
running<00:03:37.650> created<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:39.320> most<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.530> them<00:03:40.650> are

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
running created but most of them are

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.180 
running created but most of them are
here<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.240> Sam<00:03:42.750> bug<00:03:42.960> fixes<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.710> those

by any chance probably not Oh committing
the<00:03:57.240> sticks<00:03:57.480> let's<00:03:57.870> see<00:03:57.960> if<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
the sticks let's see if I can make a

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.490 
the sticks let's see if I can make a
painting<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.630> we<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.050> actually<00:04:01.200> make<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
painting so we can actually make a
