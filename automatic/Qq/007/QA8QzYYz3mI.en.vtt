00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:32.769 
defensively for quite a while and we had

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:33.959 
defensively for quite a while and we had
a<00:05:32.799> few<00:05:33.099> problems<00:05:33.129> we<00:05:33.549> weren't<00:05:33.759> getting

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
a few problems we weren't getting

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.699 
a few problems we weren't getting
forward<00:05:34.359> enough<00:05:34.509> at<00:05:34.659> times<00:05:34.869> and<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.559> know<00:05:35.619> we

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:35.709 
forward enough at times and you know we

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:36.779 
forward enough at times and you know we
seem<00:05:35.889> to<00:05:35.979> have<00:05:36.009> soared<00:05:36.309> that<00:05:36.459> out<00:05:36.609> at<00:05:36.729> the

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
seem to have soared that out at the

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.179 
seem to have soared that out at the
moment<00:05:36.969> and<00:05:37.269> yeah<00:05:37.959> we've<00:05:38.289> we've<00:05:38.949> defended

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
moment and yeah we've we've defended

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.619 
moment and yeah we've we've defended
well<00:05:39.429> all<00:05:39.579> season<00:05:39.609> I<00:05:40.149> think<00:05:40.389> we've<00:05:40.509> probably

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
well all season I think we've probably

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.769 
well all season I think we've probably
got<00:05:40.809> the<00:05:40.959> second<00:05:41.259> best<00:05:41.379> defensive<00:05:42.159> record<00:05:42.279> and

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
got the second best defensive record and

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.419 
got the second best defensive record and
but<00:05:43.779> now<00:05:43.929> we're<00:05:44.079> knocking<00:05:44.709> a<00:05:44.769> few<00:05:44.799> girls<00:05:45.159> in<00:05:45.279> as

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:45.429 
but now we're knocking a few girls in as

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:46.679 
but now we're knocking a few girls in as
well<00:05:45.549> although<00:05:45.759> we<00:05:45.939> only<00:05:45.969> got<00:05:46.179> one<00:05:46.239> today<00:05:46.539> but

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689

chance about two games after that and
never<00:06:27.639> looked<00:06:27.849> back<00:06:27.909> so<00:06:28.629> maybe<00:06:29.229> that<00:06:29.349> kick<00:06:29.499> up

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:29.619

friends<00:06:40.329> i<00:06:40.449> because<00:06:40.719> i<00:06:40.869> think<00:06:41.079> is<00:06:41.319> the<00:06:41.439> best

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:41.559 
friends i because i think is the best

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.579 
friends i because i think is the best
defensive<00:06:41.979> midfield<00:06:42.309> player<00:06:42.489> in<00:06:43.149> the<00:06:43.389> league

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
defensive midfield player in the league

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:45.419 
defensive midfield player in the league
and<00:06:44.589> i<00:06:44.679> think<00:06:44.889> he<00:06:44.949> should<00:06:45.129> play<00:06:45.219> at<00:06:45.369> a<00:06:45.399> high

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:45.429 
and i think he should play at a high

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:47.489 
and i think he should play at a high
level<00:06:45.779> but<00:06:46.779> you<00:06:46.869> know<00:06:46.959> obviously<00:06:47.049> perfect

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:47.499 
level but you know obviously perfect

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:48.989 
level but you know obviously perfect

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:48.999 
Lloyd didn't think so so maybe he's

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.759
