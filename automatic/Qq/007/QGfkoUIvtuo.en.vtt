monitoring<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.539> also<00:00:30.929> suggest<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.800> with

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
monitoring and I also suggest start with

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
monitoring and I also suggest start with
Windows<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.309> start<00:00:32.550> minimized<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.570> want

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
Windows to start minimized if you want

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
Windows to start minimized if you want
your<00:00:34.020> GPU<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.649> overclocked<00:00:35.100> every<00:00:35.370> time

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
your GPU to be overclocked every time

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.479 
your GPU to be overclocked every time
your<00:00:35.760> windows<00:00:36.030> britz<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.980> usually<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
your windows britz up so I usually have

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.000 
your windows britz up so I usually have
mine<00:00:38.730> running<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:40.010> 771<00:00:41.010> 540<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.940> 900<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> max

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
mine running on 771 540 and 900 the max

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.709 
mine running on 771 540 and 900 the max
temp<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> seems<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> have

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
temp it seems to get up to when I have

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.319 
temp it seems to get up to when I have
that<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.289> 75<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> CPU<00:00:47.789> gets<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that is about 75 and the CPU gets up to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
that is about 75 and the CPU gets up to
about<00:00:48.390> maybe<00:00:49.079> 75

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
about maybe 75

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
about maybe 75
well<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> suggest<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.030> disable<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> turbo

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
well I suggest you disable the turbo

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
well I suggest you disable the turbo
mode<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.579> you've<00:00:53.789> got<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.480> turbo<00:00:54.809> mode

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
mode if you've got the turbo mode

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
mode if you've got the turbo mode
enabled<00:00:55.530> CPU<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.510> have<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.809> 2.2<00:00:58.440> gigahertz<00:00:59.129> i7

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

gigahertz<00:01:03.270> turbo<00:01:03.809> mode<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> only

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
gigahertz turbo mode because the only

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.690 
gigahertz turbo mode because the only
way<00:01:05.580> M<00:01:05.700> 14x<00:01:06.360> has<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> same<00:01:07.409> heat<00:01:08.250> pipe<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
way M 14x has the same heat pipe for the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
GPU and the CPU it's not recommended to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
GPU and the CPU it's not recommended to
have<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> turbo<00:01:12.030> mode<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.840> could

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
have the turbo mode because it could

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
have the turbo mode because it could
cause<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.560> CPU<00:01:13.979> temps<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.430> rise<00:01:16.610> I've<00:01:17.610> wanted

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
cause your CPU temps to rise I've wanted

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.289 
cause your CPU temps to rise I've wanted
to<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.299> temps<00:01:18.890> show<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.159> regularly<00:01:20.700> with

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to my temps show up very regularly with

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
to my temps show up very regularly with
running<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.780> settings<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:22.799> never

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
running these settings and they never

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.640 
running these settings and they never
seem<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> hit<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.759> 80<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.350> pretty<00:01:25.530> happy
