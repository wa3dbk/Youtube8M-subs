00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's fine for a demo but we're trying

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
that's fine for a demo but we're trying
to<00:00:59.370> build<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> full<00:00:59.879> game<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> couple

alright<00:02:21.990> I'm<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.320> test<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.550> as

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
alright I'm going to test it out and as

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.800 
alright I'm going to test it out and as
you<00:02:27.760> notice<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.150> background<00:02:28.510> use<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you notice we have background use of it

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.199 
you notice we have background use of it
listen<00:02:31.590> every<00:02:32.590> time<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.920> die<00:02:33.130> its<00:02:33.640> restart

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
listen every time you die its restart

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.760 
listen every time you die its restart
the<00:02:34.420> loop<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> that's<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.350> what

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
the loop and that's not good so what

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.190 
the loop and that's not good so what
we're<00:02:35.890> gonna<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:37.120> go<00:02:37.330> into<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.660> behavior

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
we're gonna do is go into the behavior

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.840 
we're gonna do is go into the behavior
and<00:02:38.440> make<00:02:38.650> sure<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.920> do<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.220> we're<00:02:39.640> gonna<00:02:39.700> add

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and make sure to do this we're gonna add

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.490 
and make sure to do this we're gonna add
stop<00:02:40.690> all<00:02:40.959> sounds<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.140> way<00:02:44.260> every<00:02:44.470> time

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
stop all sounds so that way every time

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.410 
stop all sounds so that way every time
they<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.130> restarts<00:02:45.790> gonna<00:02:46.060> stop<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
they see it restarts gonna stop the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.270 
they see it restarts gonna stop the
sounds<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.170> start<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> loop<00:02:47.769> again<00:02:52.890> think<00:02:53.890> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
sounds and start the loop again think so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280 
sounds and start the loop again think so
sound<00:02:54.700> restarts<00:02:55.420> it's<00:02:55.630> exactly<00:02:56.019> what<00:02:56.230> we

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
sound restarts it's exactly what we

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.400 
sound restarts it's exactly what we
wanted<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.600> that's<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.290> this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
wanted to do and that's it for this
