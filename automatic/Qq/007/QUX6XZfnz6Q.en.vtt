00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
one I've never seen anybody played in a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
one I've never seen anybody played in a
simple<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> jumping<00:00:44.700> jack<00:00:44.910> flash<00:00:44.960> because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
simple way is jumping jack flash because

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.479 
simple way is jumping jack flash because
most<00:00:46.289> people<00:00:46.559> play<00:00:46.710> jump<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.039> there<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.280> place

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
most people play jump in there at place

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.950 
most people play jump in there at place
I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:47.850> they're<00:00:47.969> down<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.210> somewhere<00:00:48.690> on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I think they're down here somewhere on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
I think they're down here somewhere on
the<00:00:49.050> neck<00:00:49.260> moving<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the neck moving up and that's kind of a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
the neck moving up and that's kind of a
little<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.710> advanced<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.129> harder

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
little bit more advanced and it's harder

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
little bit more advanced and it's harder
to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.629> people<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:56.300> we<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> play

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to do for some people so we can play

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.029 
to do for some people so we can play
jumping<00:00:57.930> jack<00:00:58.109> flash<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
jumping jack flash with some of the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
jumping jack flash with some of the
basic<00:00:59.609> simple<00:00:59.789> chords<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> cards<00:01:00.629> are

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
basic simple chords and the cards are

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
basic simple chords and the cards are
going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.960> using<00:01:01.079> their<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:02.120> G<00:01:03.120> C<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:05.090> D<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
going to be using their a G C and D and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.310 
going to be using their a G C and D and
that's<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.820> cycle<00:01:09.320> back

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that's it and they just they cycle back

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
that's it and they just they cycle back
and<00:01:10.530> forth<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.390> beginning<00:01:12.390> sounds<00:01:12.689> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and forth but the beginning sounds like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.069 
and forth but the beginning sounds like
this

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.310 

and<00:01:20.079> that's<00:01:20.320> nothing<00:01:20.829> but<00:01:21.100> an<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.840> energy<00:01:22.840> and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and that's nothing but an a energy and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.179 
and that's nothing but an a energy and
then<00:01:23.470> you're<00:01:23.710> not<00:01:23.799> going<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.009> believe<00:01:24.040> me

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
then you're not going to believe me

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:34.870 
then you're not going to believe me
that's<00:01:24.610> what<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:24.850> a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.430 

and<00:01:35.880> sound<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> saying<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> time<00:01:37.200> but

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
and sound the saying that time but

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.410 
and sound the saying that time but
that's<00:01:37.620> because<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.280> played<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.020 

and<00:01:57.740> all<00:01:57.859> I'm<00:01:58.009> doing<00:01:58.280> is<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:58.429> opening<00:01:58.700> and

and all I'm doing is just opening and
closing<00:01:59.179> that<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> and<00:01:59.810> sometimes<00:02:00.289> we're

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
closing that a and sometimes we're

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.289 
closing that a and sometimes we're
actually<00:02:00.590> playing<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.340> with<00:02:02.090> nothing

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
actually playing like this with nothing

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.270 
actually playing like this with nothing
so<00:02:03.109> just

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.420 

a<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:09.410> open<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.330> G<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.430> then

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
a a open and then go to the G and then

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.220 
a a open and then go to the G and then
you're<00:02:14.670> doing<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> g<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> same<00:02:15.870> thing

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you're doing the g do the same thing

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.170 
you're doing the g do the same thing
take<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.800> fingers<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.430> press<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.120> down

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
take your fingers up and press them down

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.730 
take your fingers up and press them down

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
so sometimes you're actually playing

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.820 
so sometimes you're actually playing
nothing<00:02:20.510> sometimes<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.660> play<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> me<00:02:22.200> and
