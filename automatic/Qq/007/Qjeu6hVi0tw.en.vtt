00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
have a program here WinRAR ok it works

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.130 
have a program here WinRAR ok it works
fine<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
fine over here but we're just going to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.440 
fine over here but we're just going to
show<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.850> compatibility

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
show you how to use the compatibility

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.770 
show you how to use the compatibility
mode<00:00:45.629> okay<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.770> right-click<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
mode okay so you right-click on it and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.029 
mode okay so you right-click on it and
you<00:00:48.780> could<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> troubleshoot

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you could do the troubleshoot

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.510 
you could do the troubleshoot
compatibility<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> would<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.250> through

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
compatibility and it would look through

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.350 
compatibility and it would look through
the<00:00:53.969> entire<00:00:54.270> program<00:00:54.570> settings<00:00:55.170> etc<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.920> see

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
the entire program settings etc and see

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
the entire program settings etc and see
whether<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.629> needs<00:00:57.660> anything<00:00:58.379> ok<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> could

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
whether it needs anything ok you could

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
whether it needs anything ok you could
try<00:00:59.280> recommended<00:00:59.789> settings<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.570> could

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
try recommended settings or you could

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
try recommended settings or you could
use<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> troubleshoot<00:01:01.859> program<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.049> basically

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
use a troubleshoot program and basically

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.780 
use a troubleshoot program and basically
you<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.199> say<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.830> example<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.610> doesn't

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you could say for example it doesn't

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.630 
you could say for example it doesn't
display<00:01:06.330> correctly<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.979> worked<00:01:08.250> fine

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
display correctly or it worked fine

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.359 
display correctly or it worked fine
before<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> different<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> Windows

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
before and a different kind of Windows

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.200 
before and a different kind of Windows
or<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.240> requires<00:01:12.450> special<00:01:13.260> programs<00:01:13.970> ok<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.150> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
or it requires special programs ok or I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
or it requires special programs ok or I
can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> problem<00:01:16.740> listed<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> go

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
can see the problem listed and you go

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.670 
can see the problem listed and you go
ahead<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> find<00:01:18.900> different<00:01:19.380> different

solutions<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.880> manual<00:01:21.299> option<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.470> basically

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
solutions the manual option is basically

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.260 
solutions the manual option is basically
click<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.970> there

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
click over there

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.390 
click over there
click<00:01:24.479> properties<00:01:25.759> compatibility<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.240> now

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
click properties compatibility and now

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.600 
click properties compatibility and now
we<00:01:29.400> could<00:01:29.700> run<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.390> program<00:01:31.159> for<00:01:32.159> example<00:01:32.549> if

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
we could run this program for example if

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.999 
we could run this program for example if
it<00:01:32.670> worked<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.090> Windows<00:01:33.479> XP<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> way

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it worked in Windows XP or all the way

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
it worked in Windows XP or all the way
back<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> Windows<00:01:35.759> 95<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.810> worked<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.290> Windows

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
back to Windows 95 it worked in Windows

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.999 
back to Windows 95 it worked in Windows
95<00:01:38.210> ok<00:01:39.210> maybe<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.840> color<00:01:40.079> settings<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.799> can

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
95 ok maybe the color settings that can

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
95 ok maybe the color settings that can
fraud<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> new<00:01:42.000> color<00:01:42.329> settings<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
fraud in the new color settings so you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
fraud in the new color settings so you
need<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> reduced<00:01:44.340> color<00:01:44.610> mode<00:01:44.909> ok

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
need to have in a reduced color mode ok

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.740 
need to have in a reduced color mode ok
some<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> 8-bit<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.680> 16-bit<00:01:47.479> ok<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
some of the 8-bit or 16-bit ok a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.530 
some of the 8-bit or 16-bit ok a
different<00:01:49.409> screen<00:01:49.799> size<00:01:50.130> maybe<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.210> screen

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
different screen size maybe the screen

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.230 
different screen size maybe the screen
maximum<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> those<00:01:52.619> days<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.220> set<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.670> 640<00:01:54.119> by
