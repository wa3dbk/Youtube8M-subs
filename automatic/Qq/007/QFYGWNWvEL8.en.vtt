Black Diamond stone lamp in this review
the<00:00:07.620> video<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.400> little<00:00:08.519> bit<00:00:08.610> darker<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.510> you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the video is a little bit darker so you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.560 
the video is a little bit darker so you
can<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.800> light<00:00:11.219> hopefully<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
can see the light hopefully like here I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
can see the light hopefully like here I
have<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> Black<00:00:13.230> Diamond<00:00:13.469> stone<00:00:13.920> lamp<00:00:14.160> in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
have the Black Diamond stone lamp in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.090 
have the Black Diamond stone lamp in
black<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.750> let's<00:00:16.379> run<00:00:16.500> through<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
black so let's run through some of the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.140 
black so let's run through some of the
features<00:00:17.359> first<00:00:18.359> foremost<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.050> has<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.150> 100

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

looms<00:00:21.449> hence<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.140> GG<00:00:22.439> called<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> Black

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
looms hence a GG called the Black

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
looms hence a GG called the Black
Diamond<00:00:23.189> storm<00:00:23.609> 100<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.779> about<00:00:25.320> he<00:00:25.439> throws

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Diamond storm 100 which about he throws

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
less I would say that's about true from

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.840 
less I would say that's about true from
the<00:00:30.750> field<00:00:31.199> work<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> I've<00:00:31.679> done<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.130> it

a little bit lighter alright there we go

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.140 
a little bit lighter alright there we go
it<00:03:07.110> starts<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.590> dim<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.640> you'll<00:03:08.760> notice<00:03:09.060> a

it starts to dim and you'll notice a
little<00:03:09.330> quick<00:03:09.570> flash<00:03:09.900> once<00:03:10.739> it's<00:03:11.480> reached

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
little quick flash once it's reached

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.930 
little quick flash once it's reached
maximum<00:03:12.930> dim<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.470> minimums<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.790> go

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
maximum dim or minimums in so here we go

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.220 
maximum dim or minimums in so here we go
let's<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:15.239> maximum<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.720> you'll<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:15.959> flash

let's go maximum and you'll see flash

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
let's go maximum and you'll see flash
there<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.489> minimum<00:03:18.120> again<00:03:18.980> there<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.130> is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
there it is a minimum again there it is

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250 
there it is a minimum again there it is
okay<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.060> obviously<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.570> stop<00:03:21.870> anywhere

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
okay and obviously you can stop anywhere

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.520 
okay and obviously you can stop anywhere
in<00:03:22.320> between<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:24.019> alternate<00:03:25.019> there

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
in between so I can just alternate there

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.500 
in between so I can just alternate there
all<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.220> turning<00:03:26.850> him<00:03:27.000> back<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.360> again

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
all right so turning him back off again

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.509 
all right so turning him back off again
now<00:03:28.170> next<00:03:28.590> time<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> turn<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.220> these<00:03:29.459> two

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
now next time I turn it on these two

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.670 
now next time I turn it on these two
side<00:03:30.120> LEDs<00:03:30.630> are<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.019> turn<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.560> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
side LEDs are going to turn on so this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
side LEDs are going to turn on so this
actually<00:03:32.040> throws<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.489> beam<00:03:32.670> out<00:03:32.940> wide<00:03:33.150> really

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
actually throws the beam out wide really

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.289 
actually throws the beam out wide really
good<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.900> reading<00:03:34.440> or<00:03:34.700> cooking<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.880> low<00:03:36.060> light

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
good for reading or cooking in low light

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.030 
good for reading or cooking in low light
or<00:03:36.330> something<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.170> something<00:03:37.709> close

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.640 
see there there's the battery indicator
which<00:03:42.630> I'm<00:03:42.780> sure<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.049> going<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.230> go<00:03:43.320> orange

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
which I'm sure it's going to go orange

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.460 
which I'm sure it's going to go orange
in<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.860> sec<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.329> way<00:03:45.480> there<00:03:46.110> are<00:03:46.290> two

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
in a sec but in the way there are two

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.590 
in a sec but in the way there are two
side<00:03:46.739> LEDs<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.400> again<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.239> little<00:03:48.510> bit

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
side LEDs and again it's a little bit

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.509 
side LEDs and again it's a little bit
harder<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> see<00:03:49.320> but<00:03:49.620> they're<00:03:49.769> dimmable<00:03:50.160> as

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
harder to see but they're dimmable as

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.930 
harder to see but they're dimmable as
well<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.620> don't<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.799> goes<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.220> again<00:03:53.489> it's

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
well I don't like goes and again it's

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.740 
well I don't like goes and again it's
got<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.299> little<00:03:55.430> flash<00:03:56.430> at<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> end<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
got the little flash at the end the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.259 
got the little flash at the end the
other<00:03:57.870> thing<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.560> does<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.459> red<00:03:59.790> LEDs

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
other thing this does have is red LEDs

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.550 
other thing this does have is red LEDs
so<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.930> have<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.170> hold<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.440> for

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
so for that you have to hold it for

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.630 
so for that you have to hold it for
three<00:04:01.799> seconds<00:04:02.959> two<00:04:03.959> three<00:04:04.320> there<00:04:04.709> we<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:05.070> okay

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
three seconds two three there we go okay

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.240 
three seconds two three there we go okay
these<00:04:06.000> are<00:04:06.239> not<00:04:06.450> dimmable<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:07.860> they<00:04:08.040> pretty

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
these are not dimmable so they pretty

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
these are not dimmable so they pretty
much<00:04:08.400> stay<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.120> whole<00:04:09.269> time<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:10.410> I

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
much stay like that the whole time if I

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
much stay like that the whole time if I
press<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:10.950> hold<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.430> turns<00:04:11.730> off<00:04:12.019> okay<00:04:14.090> if

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
press and hold it just turns off okay if

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.360 
press and hold it just turns off okay if
I<00:04:15.630> press<00:04:16.079> again<00:04:16.200> just<00:04:16.500> wanted<00:04:16.859> turns<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.220> back

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
I press again just wanted turns it back

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.920 
I press again just wanted turns it back
so<00:04:17.640> that's<00:04:17.820> quite<00:04:18.000> convenient<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.780> leave

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so that's quite convenient you can leave

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.300 
so that's quite convenient you can leave

here<00:04:41.919> we<00:04:42.010> go

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
here we go

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.659 
here we go
strobing<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.410> red<00:04:44.590> lights<00:04:44.800> also<00:04:45.040> stripes<00:04:45.520> so

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
strobing the red lights also stripes so

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.390 
strobing the red lights also stripes so
let's<00:04:45.850> switch<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.180> red<00:04:46.480> first<00:04:46.780> 1<00:04:47.380> 2<00:04:47.740> 3<00:04:48.070> there

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
let's switch it to red first 1 2 3 there

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
let's switch it to red first 1 2 3 there
we<00:04:48.550> go<00:04:48.760> turn<00:04:49.480> it<00:04:49.570> off<00:04:49.690> red<00:04:49.900> mode<00:04:50.139> and<00:04:50.380> now<00:04:50.470> press

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
we go turn it off red mode and now press

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.730 
we go turn it off red mode and now press
it<00:04:50.919> three<00:04:51.100> times<00:04:51.370> 1<00:04:51.820> 2<00:04:52.060> 3<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.960> there<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.590> go

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
it three times 1 2 3 and there you go

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.240 
it three times 1 2 3 and there you go
the<00:04:53.979> red<00:04:54.190> lights<00:04:54.430> are<00:04:54.669> strobing<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:56.620> even

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
the red lights are strobing so even

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.219 
the red lights are strobing so even
though<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.430> does<00:04:57.610> have<00:04:57.820> one<00:04:58.120> button<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.870> one

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
though it does have one button that one

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.409 
though it does have one button that one
button<00:04:59.470> achieves<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.160> lot<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.550> functions<00:05:01.000> it

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
button achieves a lot of functions it

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.140 
button achieves a lot of functions it
does<00:05:01.690> get<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:01.960> little<00:05:02.080> bit<00:05:02.320> confusing<00:05:02.970> but<00:05:03.970> it's

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
does get a little bit confusing but it's

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.750 
does get a little bit confusing but it's
pretty<00:05:04.419> quick<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:04.690> easy<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.169> master<00:05:05.760> just

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
pretty quick and easy to master just

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.100 
pretty quick and easy to master just
take<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.120> out<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.389> play<00:05:07.540> around<00:05:07.660> with<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.020> for

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
take it out and play around with it for

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.960 
take it out and play around with it for
a<00:05:08.229> little<00:05:08.350> bit<00:05:08.500> one<00:05:09.340> thing<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.610> don't<00:05:09.669> like

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
a little bit one thing I don't like

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.969 
a little bit one thing I don't like
about<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.479> torch<00:05:10.810> if<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.200> switch<00:05:11.530> back<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.830> the

they're<00:05:24.130> quite<00:05:24.370> nice<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.970> go<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.450> turn<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.900> off

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
they're quite nice I go to turn it off

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.400 
they're quite nice I go to turn it off
and<00:05:26.400> I'm<00:05:27.400> still<00:05:27.640> doing<00:05:27.760> my<00:05:27.910> close<00:05:28.360> camp<00:05:29.140> chores

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
and I'm still doing my close camp chores

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.140 
and I'm still doing my close camp chores
here<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.650> turn<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.979> back<00:05:30.130> on<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.580> get<00:05:30.820> straight

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
here I turn it back on I get straight

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.350 
here I turn it back on I get straight
away<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.539> really<00:05:31.930> bright<00:05:32.169> LED<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:34.270> the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
away the really bright LED not the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.700 
away the really bright LED not the
nicest<00:05:34.539> thing<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:34.960> water<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.260> probably<00:05:35.500> would

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
nicest thing the water I probably would

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.340 
nicest thing the water I probably would
have<00:05:35.800> preferred<00:05:36.100> two<00:05:36.430> buttons<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.169> turn

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
have preferred two buttons one to turn

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.659 
have preferred two buttons one to turn
on<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.620> main<00:05:38.740> le<00:05:38.979> do<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.190> want<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.400> turn<00:05:39.580> on

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
on the main le do you want to turn on

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.050 
on the main le do you want to turn on
the<00:05:39.760> side<00:05:40.000> LED<00:05:40.450> but<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.770> can<00:05:42.039> get<00:05:42.789> through

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
the side LED but you can get through

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.990 
the side LED but you can get through
that<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.990> other<00:05:44.229> problem<00:05:44.500> is<00:05:44.890> okay<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:45.610> maybe

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
that the other problem is okay so maybe

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.850 
that the other problem is okay so maybe
I'm<00:05:46.240> using<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:46.690> light<00:05:46.930> but<00:05:47.169> I<00:05:47.200> have<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.560> set

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
I'm using this light but I have it set

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.279 
I'm using this light but I have it set
to<00:05:47.890> as<00:05:48.490> dim<00:05:49.180> as<00:05:49.300> possible<00:05:49.870> because<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.110> don't

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
to as dim as possible because I don't

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.260 
to as dim as possible because I don't
need<00:05:50.410> such<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.650> bright<00:05:50.919> light<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.400> turn<00:05:51.970> it<00:05:52.120> off

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
need such a bright light I turn it off

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.170 
need such a bright light I turn it off
ok<00:05:52.930> now<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.710> turn<00:05:53.979> it<00:05:54.310> back<00:05:54.340> on<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:55.030> it's

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
ok now I turn it back on and it's

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.490 
ok now I turn it back on and it's
obviously<00:05:55.539> going<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:55.750> turn<00:05:55.930> on<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.139> side<00:05:56.350> it

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
obviously going to turn on the side it

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.070 
obviously going to turn on the side it
ladies<00:05:56.830> but<00:05:57.039> obviously<00:05:57.430> it<00:05:57.520> turns<00:05:57.729> it<00:05:57.910> on

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
ladies but obviously it turns it on

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.360 
ladies but obviously it turns it on
maximum<00:05:59.080> power<00:05:59.320> again<00:05:59.710> so<00:05:59.979> if<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.160> want<00:06:00.310> to

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
maximum power again so if I want to

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.560 
maximum power again so if I want to
cycle<00:06:00.639> back<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.910> that<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.180> maximum<00:06:01.479> power

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
cycle back to that on maximum power

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.540 
cycle back to that on maximum power
again<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.320> would<00:06:02.530> be<00:06:02.740> nice<00:06:02.889> if<00:06:02.950> it<00:06:03.250> saved

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
again so it would be nice if it saved

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.540 
again so it would be nice if it saved
your<00:06:03.700> setting<00:06:04.060> but<00:06:04.270> again<00:06:05.169> it's<00:06:05.560> one<00:06:05.889> button

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
your setting but again it's one button

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.520 
your setting but again it's one button
operate<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.389> guess<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.870> can't<00:06:08.139> have

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
operate so I guess you can't have

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
operate so I guess you can't have
everything<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:11.650> weight<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.950> this<00:06:12.010> torch<00:06:12.340> it's

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
everything the weight of this torch it's

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.820 
everything the weight of this torch it's
about<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:12.820> hundred<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.479> eleven<00:06:13.990> grams<00:06:14.590> or

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
about a hundred and eleven grams or

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.010 
about a hundred and eleven grams or
three<00:06:15.190> point<00:06:15.520> nine<00:06:15.610> ounces<00:06:16.360> I<00:06:16.510> think<00:06:16.720> it<00:06:16.810> says

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
three point nine ounces I think it says

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.779 
three point nine ounces I think it says
on<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.289> specs<00:06:17.620> so<00:06:17.830> it's<00:06:18.010> not<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.340> lightest

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
on the specs so it's not the lightest

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.490 
on the specs so it's not the lightest
torch<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.180> oil<00:06:19.389> it's<00:06:19.690> not<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:20.110> smallest

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
torch and oil it's not the smallest

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.650 
torch and oil it's not the smallest
torch<00:06:20.919> at<00:06:21.070> all<00:06:21.220> and<00:06:21.520> I<00:06:21.580> probably<00:06:21.850> wouldn't<00:06:22.240> run

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
torch at all and I probably wouldn't run

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.219 
torch at all and I probably wouldn't run
with<00:06:22.870> it

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
with it

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.129 
with it
it<00:06:23.500> does<00:06:23.740> bounce<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.610> little<00:06:25.120> bit<00:06:25.630> or<00:06:25.870> you<00:06:25.990> have

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
it does bounce a little bit or you have

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.580 
it does bounce a little bit or you have
to<00:06:26.229> have<00:06:26.380> the<00:06:26.470> strap<00:06:26.770> on<00:06:26.800> quite<00:06:27.370> tight<00:06:28.260> but<00:06:29.260> for

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
to have the strap on quite tight but for

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.010 
to have the strap on quite tight but for
walking<00:06:30.099> around<00:06:30.220> camping<00:06:31.150> you<00:06:31.599> know<00:06:31.630> chores

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
walking around camping you know chores

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
walking around camping you know chores
around<00:06:32.229> the<00:06:32.500> campsite<00:06:32.800> etc<00:06:33.340> it's

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
around the campsite etc it's

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.920 
around the campsite etc it's
really<00:06:34.700> really<00:06:34.850> good<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.690> know<00:06:35.810> the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
really really good you know the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.540 
really really good you know the
batteries<00:06:36.230> are<00:06:36.320> going<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.500> last<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.860> long<00:06:37.490> time

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
batteries are going to last a long time

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.510 
batteries are going to last a long time
I've<00:06:37.970> taken<00:06:38.240> this<00:06:38.600> thing<00:06:38.840> out<00:06:38.990> about<00:06:39.680> eight<00:06:40.340> to

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
I've taken this thing out about eight to

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.600 
I've taken this thing out about eight to
ten<00:06:40.730> times<00:06:40.760> I<00:06:41.420> use<00:06:42.290> it<00:06:42.470> pretty<00:06:42.680> sparingly<00:06:43.460> I

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
ten times I use it pretty sparingly I

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.710 
ten times I use it pretty sparingly I
don't<00:06:43.880> have<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.120> load<00:06:44.300> on<00:06:44.450> where<00:06:44.570> I<00:06:44.660> don't

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
don't have the load on where I don't

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.920 
don't have the load on where I don't
need<00:06:45.110> it<00:06:45.290> but<00:06:45.770> it's<00:06:46.520> only<00:06:46.940> just<00:06:47.270> come<00:06:47.570> on<00:06:47.750> to

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
need it but it's only just come on to

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.930 
need it but it's only just come on to
that<00:06:48.080> orange<00:06:48.470> battery<00:06:49.310> indicator<00:06:49.700> so<00:06:49.850> I've

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
that orange battery indicator so I've

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.510 
that orange battery indicator so I've
just<00:06:49.970> reached<00:06:50.560> 75%<00:06:51.560> as<00:06:51.740> you've<00:06:51.920> just<00:06:51.950> seen<00:06:52.280> so

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
just reached 75% as you've just seen so

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.790 
just reached 75% as you've just seen so
it<00:06:52.550> does<00:06:52.790> last<00:06:53.030> quite<00:06:53.150> a<00:06:53.390> while<00:06:53.690> the<00:06:54.650> other

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
it does last quite a while the other

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.710 
it does last quite a while the other
thing<00:06:55.010> this<00:06:55.160> does<00:06:55.550> have<00:06:55.850> is<00:06:56.060> up<00:06:56.930> to<00:06:57.460> 75%<00:06:58.460> so<00:06:59.120> 75%

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
thing this does have is up to 75% so 75%

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.230 
thing this does have is up to 75% so 75%
plus<00:07:00.110> it<00:07:00.260> does<00:07:00.410> have<00:07:00.620> a<00:07:00.650> regulator<00:07:01.190> so<00:07:02.000> it

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
plus it does have a regulator so it

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.790 
plus it does have a regulator so it
keeps<00:07:02.390> the<00:07:02.570> light<00:07:02.810> even<00:07:03.050> the<00:07:03.350> whole<00:07:03.500> way<00:07:03.620> down

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
keeps the light even the whole way down

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.220 
keeps the light even the whole way down
and<00:07:04.040> once<00:07:04.190> you<00:07:04.310> dip<00:07:04.520> below<00:07:04.670> that<00:07:04.940> 75%<00:07:05.930> the

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
and once you dip below that 75% the

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.470 
and once you dip below that 75% the
light<00:07:06.650> won't<00:07:06.950> be<00:07:07.100> consistent<00:07:07.730> anymore<00:07:08.060> but<00:07:08.270> I

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
light won't be consistent anymore but I

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.480 
light won't be consistent anymore but I
mean<00:07:09.080> you<00:07:09.350> saw<00:07:09.530> it<00:07:09.560> go<00:07:09.680> from<00:07:09.980> green<00:07:10.250> to<00:07:10.460> orange

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
mean you saw it go from green to orange

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.340 
mean you saw it go from green to orange
and<00:07:10.910> you<00:07:11.120> don't<00:07:11.270> really<00:07:11.420> see<00:07:11.600> any<00:07:11.720> be<00:07:11.870> changed

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
and you don't really see any be changed

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.740 
and you don't really see any be changed
so<00:07:12.560> I<00:07:12.770> will<00:07:13.580> update<00:07:13.760> this<00:07:14.060> video<00:07:14.270> or<00:07:14.510> post

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
so I will update this video or post

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.780 
so I will update this video or post
another<00:07:15.290> one<00:07:15.560> I'll<00:07:15.800> take<00:07:16.100> the<00:07:16.220> comments<00:07:16.610> later

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:16.790 
another one I'll take the comments later

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.250 
another one I'll take the comments later
on<00:07:16.970> and<00:07:17.150> let<00:07:17.240> you<00:07:17.330> know<00:07:17.450> how<00:07:17.690> bad<00:07:18.110> the

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
on and let you know how bad the

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.740 
on and let you know how bad the
degradation<00:07:18.440> of<00:07:18.920> the<00:07:19.070> light<00:07:19.280> is<00:07:19.490> in<00:07:20.270> terms<00:07:20.600> of

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
degradation of the light is in terms of

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.940 
degradation of the light is in terms of
where<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:20.900> put<00:07:21.020> the<00:07:21.110> batteries<00:07:21.470> the<00:07:21.620> four

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
where you put the batteries the four

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.460 
where you put the batteries the four
triple<00:07:22.670> A's<00:07:22.880> you<00:07:23.570> just<00:07:23.720> unscrew<00:07:23.960> that<00:07:24.290> and

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
triple A's you just unscrew that and

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.280 
triple A's you just unscrew that and
actually<00:07:24.830> off<00:07:25.130> it<00:07:25.310> inside<00:07:25.670> the<00:07:25.850> light<00:07:26.060> so<00:07:26.540> you

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290 
actually off it inside the light so you

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.080 
actually off it inside the light so you
know<00:07:27.410> it<00:07:27.620> does<00:07:27.830> get<00:07:28.070> a<00:07:28.100> fair<00:07:28.460> few<00:07:28.700> batteries

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
know it does get a fair few batteries

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.240 
know it does get a fair few batteries
but<00:07:29.390> again<00:07:29.990> you<00:07:30.140> can<00:07:30.290> take<00:07:30.500> this<00:07:30.650> out<00:07:30.920> for<00:07:30.950> a

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
but again you can take this out for a

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.160 
but again you can take this out for a
long<00:07:31.520> camping<00:07:32.030> trip<00:07:32.270> long<00:07:32.510> hike<00:07:32.780> and<00:07:32.990> you<00:07:33.050> know

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.170 
long camping trip long hike and you know

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.840 
long camping trip long hike and you know
the<00:07:33.350> battery's<00:07:33.710> gonna<00:07:33.830> last<00:07:33.920> you<00:07:34.370> a<00:07:34.400> while<00:07:34.610> and

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
the battery's gonna last you a while and

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.790 
the battery's gonna last you a while and
you<00:07:35.030> know<00:07:35.150> this<00:07:35.390> torch<00:07:35.750> is<00:07:35.810> you<00:07:36.350> can<00:07:36.500> use<00:07:36.650> it

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
you know this torch is you can use it

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.800 
you know this torch is you can use it
out<00:07:36.890> in<00:07:37.610> the<00:07:37.730> rain<00:07:37.940> and<00:07:38.180> the<00:07:38.270> storm<00:07:38.330> and<00:07:38.750> the

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810 
out in the rain and the storm and the

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.010 
out in the rain and the storm and the
wind<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.200> then<00:07:39.680> it<00:07:39.830> will<00:07:39.920> do<00:07:40.100> the<00:07:40.250> job<00:07:40.280> so

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.020 
wind and then it will do the job so

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.190 
wind and then it will do the job so
overall<00:07:42.020> I'd<00:07:42.170> probably<00:07:42.290> give<00:07:42.530> this<00:07:42.680> five<00:07:43.220> or

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.200 
overall I'd probably give this five or

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.480 
overall I'd probably give this five or
not<00:07:45.200> five<00:07:45.410> out<00:07:45.560> of<00:07:45.590> five<00:07:45.800> four<00:07:46.100> out<00:07:46.250> of<00:07:46.280> five

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490 
not five out of five four out of five

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.970 
not five out of five four out of five
simply<00:07:47.210> because<00:07:47.480> of<00:07:47.510> the<00:07:47.750> bulkiness<00:07:48.260> and<00:07:48.590> it

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980 
simply because of the bulkiness and it

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.980 
simply because of the bulkiness and it
would<00:07:49.280> be<00:07:49.520> nice<00:07:49.670> to<00:07:49.700> have<00:07:50.030> a<00:07:50.060> second<00:07:50.540> button<00:07:50.690> so

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
would be nice to have a second button so

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.560 
would be nice to have a second button so
you<00:07:51.080> don't<00:07:51.230> always<00:07:51.440> go<00:07:51.800> from<00:07:52.070> the<00:07:52.790> sides<00:07:53.060> okay

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.570 
you don't always go from the sides okay

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.680 
you don't always go from the sides okay
