can<00:01:27.540> also<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> strobe<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
can also have get to strobe so if you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
can also have get to strobe so if you
have<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.700> turned<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.000> double<00:01:30.750> click<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
have it turned on double click and you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
have it turned on double click and you
have<00:01:31.500> strobe<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> also<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
have strobe and also if you have it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
have strobe and also if you have it
turned<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.600> press<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.049> hold<00:01:34.380> it'll<00:01:35.040> cycle

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
turned on press and hold it'll cycle

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
turned on press and hold it'll cycle
through<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> other<00:01:35.880> outputs<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.079> see

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
through the other outputs when you see

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
through the other outputs when you see
the<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:38.820> let<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.150> okay

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the one that you like just let go okay

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
the one that you like just let go okay
so<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> interface<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> S<00:01:41.520> 15

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so that's the interface of the S 15

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
so that's the interface of the S 15
we're<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.750> outside<00:01:42.990> will

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
we're gonna go and take it outside will

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.740 
we're gonna go and take it outside will
show<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:43.950> outside

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
show you how it does outside

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.300 
show you how it does outside
alright<00:01:45.750> outside<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> O<00:01:46.470> light<00:01:46.770> s<00:01:46.950> 15

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
alright outside with the O light s 15

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
alright outside with the O light s 15
baton<00:01:47.640> let's<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> try<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.930> show<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
baton let's go and try it out show you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
baton let's go and try it out show you
how<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> does<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.549> too<00:01:50.670> bad<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> compact

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
how it does so not too bad for a compact

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
how it does so not too bad for a compact

now<00:01:57.930> post<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> seem<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.740> those<00:01:58.890> look

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
now post you seem to see what those look

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.639 
now post you seem to see what those look
like

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
like
pretty<00:02:01.649> good<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.009> something<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.090> put<00:02:03.240> in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
pretty good for something you can put in

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.389 
pretty good for something you can put in
your<00:02:03.360> pocket<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.869> easily<00:02:04.140> uses<00:02:04.710> cheap

easy<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.880> find<00:02:06.060> batteries<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.810> definitely

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
easy to find batteries I definitely

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.690 
easy to find batteries I definitely
recommend<00:02:07.530> using<00:02:08.099> nickel<00:02:08.459> metal<00:02:08.550> hydride

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
recommend using nickel metal hydride

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
recommend using nickel metal hydride
because<00:02:09.360> alkaline<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.050> leak<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
because alkaline is can leak and you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.080 
because alkaline is can leak and you
know

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
know

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.000 
know
really<00:02:11.300> get<00:02:11.510> any<00:02:11.959> better<00:02:12.050> performance<00:02:12.800> out<00:02:12.980> of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
really get any better performance out of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.130 
really get any better performance out of
lifting<00:02:13.370> lithium<00:02:14.030> ion<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.629> slightly<00:02:14.840> higher

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
lifting lithium ion just slightly higher

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.500 
lifting lithium ion just slightly higher
output<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:16.550> nickel<00:02:16.819> metal<00:02:16.879> hydride<00:02:17.030> or<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
output so nickel metal hydride or the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.040 
output so nickel metal hydride or the
way<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.660> go

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
way to go

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.619 
way to go
