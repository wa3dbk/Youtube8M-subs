00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.700
 people it's jerry john doe it's 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 find for a little video on 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 destiny I hope especially for you 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.140
 that it's going very well very south 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 radical I have the potato and so we are 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 left for a short video on your 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 styles and for hughes valtra on the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.539
 veterans prison 34 this week 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.580
 so that's it so I 'll make you a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.590
 little quotation marks at all because 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 there is not really that raises so in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 enjoy to talk a little bit 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.250
 other things at the same time 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
 so here's just to kill that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.280
 boss ciapa 46 solution we got it in 32 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 the first week is actually it 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 is simply to have several 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.149
 elements since the capacity of this boss 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 is to recalibrate a shield then 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.270
 attention it would not be caliber in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 damage function joola you a physio 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.489
 boss it would be caliber according to the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 time they have from which ouzou 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.180
 had removed her that you removed 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 his key word you have to put a max one 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.149
 doctor hurt damage you have a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 some time and not a number 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 of damage before his shield changes 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.460
 that's why I advise you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 to have ego trees of all types 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.070
 of elements look at me for example I 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.909
 took a main cryogenic 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.810
 Abyssal secondary and a tertiary weapon 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.509
 just fire what I was going 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.799
 the stopover better and I advise you a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.939
 bridge because I did that they 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.689
 scared I knew that pumps were from 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.280
 best idea I still wanted 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 to test the sniper is not at all a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.979
 good idea there must be a bridge not clear 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.780
 me simply because the modes you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.040
 falls on it and that makes it very 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 proud because pompous that was wanted 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.189
 kill quickly but without stop 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.299
 galleys and the spo touches I find that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 this is the best no need to go 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.540
 hide petaouchnok we fight at the entrance 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.890
 it goes very well 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 in addition we did not take the head 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 was three zarco to what I see on 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.979
 did not do it on purpose so it went 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.939
 all alone so here I would like you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.070
 talk a little bit about other things in 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.060
 same time as for example for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.619
 explain a little bit my lack 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 of activity compared to usual in 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.439
 what time do you see that usually 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 posted a video every two days to 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.100
 every two days minimum if not 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.479
 it could be once every day 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.460
 even several a day 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 then it's over and it'll be over 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.330
 my opinion for a long time 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.730
 I do not say that I will not go back 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.270
 some times 2 3 a video every 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.220
 two three days 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.890
 that's certainly what I'm going 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.600
 continue to finally try but from 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.950
 less videos in the news of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.230
 the news it will be much harder 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.910
 see besides fucking shit I him 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.770
 I was talking about this video three days 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 after the rice the reboot 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.220
 why emma simply because 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.000
 since the beginning of the week I have a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.160
 new job 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.510
 I was inactive in a very long time 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.850
 job search point very 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.220
 a long time and I finally found I 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.230
 finally a taf since Monday I am 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.630
 commercial for those interested and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.600
 so here I have more time I 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220
 works from 9 am in the morning to 18h on the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.640
 night minimum knowing that when I get home 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.400
 at home 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.870
 I have contracts to fill and that's 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.459
 contracts that I have in mind and so it's 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.890
 the taf still continues at home 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.420
 Anyway, that's it I do not really 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.010
 the time but only day of rest that 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.150
 I'm trying on saturday sunday the rest of 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.250
 the week I work there is no 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.420
 random rest tight that these Saturdays 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.090
 sunday point bar all rest of the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.620
 week we bump and and that's very 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.300
 feeling like you're working 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.430
 really from 9 am to 6 pm we have a 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.630
 15 minutes break maximum at noon seven 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.209
 month today for example these five 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.800
 minutes we are really in the process of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.630
 work all the time so it's not 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.690
 physically exhausting but mentally 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.070
 it's a little exhausting I grant you 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 it's hard enough because we will have 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.360
 contact all the time with the clientele 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.310
 to negotiate the contract etc 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.019
 we can come across real idiots like 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.000
 we can come across real pearls and 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.070
 that's it's really nervous and 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.440
 mentally a pretty complicated job 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.610
 for now I do not complain it's 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.959
 true there are some where there is debate there is 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.610
 moments of the day come but who 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.900
 is what I am doing here is shit and 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.980
 the other time of the day that's it 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.150
 see that's why I'm doing this 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.320
 job is because we have real 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.570
 human relations with real people 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.860
 true people and then times I say 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.510
 damn i'm tired we pass our 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.269
 time a market not found of my client 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.709
 to fall on fuckers 20 months ago is 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.220
 so finally in the evening when I get home 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.200
 at home 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.250
 I do not really want to play because 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.610
 that I confess that before I played 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.810
 a lot 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.040
 now when I get home from work 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 I just want to find my 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.640
 girlfriend frankly I have not I'm going 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.989
 play an hour or the max console and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.150
 then here I really prefer to be with 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.250
 my girlfriend so that's why the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.720
 all that is in play I go there 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.670
 much less time and that says pass 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.980
 a lot less will necessarily go to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.660
 level of the gaza videos are 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.010
 feel I have a lot of other gameplay 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.299
 so if I page you 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.579
 these next few days you will do some 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.199
 videos like that where he would have it and then 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.160
 here and then another gameplay I 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.109
 a lot of gameplay I would do you well 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.120
 sure the videos on the weapons that I you 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.350
 had promised and the heavy weapons of which 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.850
 episode 3 let's take stock 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.139
 that is much expected but you 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.669
 do not worry all this happens so here 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.260
 I hope a turning point for you that this 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.400
 video you liked and I tell you to the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.479
 next time for a next video 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.479
 with low turbo
