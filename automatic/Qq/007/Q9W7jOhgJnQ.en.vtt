and then he realized it was just a big

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.770 
and then he realized it was just a big
tree<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> parents<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.190> shocked

tree but that the parents got shocked
see<00:00:36.780> there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> bunch<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> branches<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
see there's a bunch of branches and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.770 
see there's a bunch of branches and
sticks<00:00:38.040> everywhere<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.510> days

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
sticks everywhere and this can take days

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
sticks everywhere and this can take days
to<00:00:39.840> remove<00:00:40.910> can<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> near<00:00:42.390> no<00:00:43.250> not<00:00:44.250> only

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to remove can we go near no not only

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
to remove can we go near no not only
will<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.239> plane<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.719> request<00:00:46.079> it's

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
will just one plane over request it's

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910 
will just one plane over request it's
also<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:47.129> let<00:00:47.550> us<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.789> stuck<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.770> need

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
also gonna let us get stuck so we need

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.889 
also gonna let us get stuck so we need
to<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.160> away<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.670> sign<00:00:54.620> yard<00:00:55.620> David<00:00:56.070> oh

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
dangerous it's gonna affect the plane

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.840 
dangerous it's gonna affect the plane
even<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.990> don't<00:01:07.140> hit<00:01:08.040> anything<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.729> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the plane go dry you're doing nothing

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.530 
the plane go dry you're doing nothing
too<00:02:46.260> bad<00:02:46.380> David<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.459> got<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.760> plane<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.239> now

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
too bad David you got the plane but now

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.030 
too bad David you got the plane but now
you<00:02:48.600> gotta<00:02:48.870> sit<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.620> gotta<00:02:49.859> pay<00:02:50.010> the
