traction control is a thing of the past
I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> puts<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.549> brings<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> new

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
I think that puts it brings a new

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.810 
I think that puts it brings a new
element<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.229> 401<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.670> makes

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
element into into into 401 and it makes

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.010 
element into into into 401 and it makes
a<00:01:29.880> lot<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.900> bit

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a lot more I think it's a little bit

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.230 
a lot more I think it's a little bit
more<00:01:31.140> physical<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> drivers<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
more physical for the drivers and a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
more physical for the drivers and a
little<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.600> challenging<00:01:34.170> while<00:01:35.100> things

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
little bit more challenging while things

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.980
