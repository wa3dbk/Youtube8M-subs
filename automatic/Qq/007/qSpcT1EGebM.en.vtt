Baldy in the distance over there and

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.789 
Baldy in the distance over there and
then<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.829> wrap<00:03:16.370> around<00:03:16.700> here<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:18.530> got<00:03:18.680> all

the San Gabriels over there you have
crystal<00:03:20.810> lake<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.519> that's<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.700> highway<00:03:23.239> 39

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
crystal lake and that's the highway 39

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.740 
crystal lake and that's the highway 39
extension<00:03:25.129> over<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.629> see

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
extension over there and the one you see

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.680 
extension over there and the one you see
the<00:03:26.840> switchbacks<00:03:27.260> yeah<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:28.670> over<00:03:29.480> there

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the switchbacks yeah and then over there

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.080 
the switchbacks yeah and then over there
is<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.780> think<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:32.870> ridic<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.349> Ridge<00:03:33.739> Road

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
is a I think that's ridic on Ridge Road

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.970 
is a I think that's ridic on Ridge Road
that<00:03:35.090> cut<00:03:35.329> right<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.109> can<00:03:36.799> see<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
that cut right there and you can see it

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.890 
that cut right there and you can see it
in<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.099> back<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.239> that's<00:03:38.420> monrovia

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
in the back to and then that's monrovia

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.500 
in the back to and then that's monrovia
peak<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:40.370> down<00:03:40.549> here<00:03:40.609> is<00:03:40.879> Cogswell<00:03:41.299> dam

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
peak and then down here is Cogswell dam

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.289 
peak and then down here is Cogswell dam
and<00:03:42.220> forgot<00:03:43.220> what<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.730> called<00:03:43.940> what<00:03:44.150> that

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
and forgot what that is called what that

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.300 
and forgot what that is called what that
reservoir<00:03:44.599> is<00:03:44.920> Cogswell<00:03:45.920> read<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.159> more<00:03:46.280> I

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
reservoir is Cogswell read the more I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.940 
reservoir is Cogswell read the more I
guess<00:03:49.900> maybe<00:03:50.900> that's<00:03:50.989> not<00:03:51.230> Cogswell<00:03:51.680> that's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
guess maybe that's not Cogswell that's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.979 
guess maybe that's not Cogswell that's
like<00:03:52.099> what's<00:03:52.579> that<00:03:52.849> highway<00:03:53.120> 39<00:03:53.420> damn<00:03:53.750> i<00:03:53.870> can

over to this little junction right here
this<00:04:39.979> little<00:04:40.220> intersection<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:40.849> then<00:04:41.360> it

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
this little intersection and then it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.490 
this little intersection and then it
goes<00:04:41.630> down<00:04:42.520> right<00:04:43.520> there<00:04:43.849> that's<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.050> back

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
goes down right there that's the back

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.779 
goes down right there that's the back
