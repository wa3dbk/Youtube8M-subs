00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.520
 and honey therefore do not be rebellious 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.950
 against jehovah 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.259
 and others to the people of this land because 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.539

 the earth and that when they returned they had done 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.220
 murmur against him to all the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.530
 congregation discrediting that country 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.050

 recognize the earth and Moses said these 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.140
 things to all the children of israel and the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.090
 people mourned a lot and they got up 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.520
 in the morning and climbed to the summit of 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.830
 mount saying here we are to go up 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.830
 where he has spoken jehovah because 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.570
 We have sinned and said Moses because 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.770
 breach is the commandment of jehovah 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.639
 this will not work either, you're going because 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.949
 jehovah is not in the midst of joy 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.409

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.759
 you have refused to follow jehovah for that 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.680
 will not be jehovah with you without 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.990
 But they persisted in climbing to the top 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.599
 of the mountain but the ark of the covenant of 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.330
 Jehovah and Moses did not leave the 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.370
 half of the camp and they descended the 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.229
 Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.810
 that mountain and they were injured and 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.810
 they defeated chasing after this weapon
