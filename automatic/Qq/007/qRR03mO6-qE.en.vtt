00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.690
 Oh well 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello my name is and that only 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.660
 here and if I want to show you an hour 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.680
 firmware update sony ericsson x10 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.099
 after which he 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 the phone got the features a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 multitouch 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 the easiest way to see them 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 in photos 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.570
 for example, he opens any 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 image 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.859
 who is that tone 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.380
 so here we are trying 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.970
 do 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 pinch to zoom 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.310
 photos this 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.050
 get a few 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.170
 otherwise 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.440
 need to press 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 finger and so carry the top of his book 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.310
 way down 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.870
 then 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 the screen will remain like this 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.950
 intricate 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.480
 or not fancy footprint 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.000
 i.e. this is not quite a multitouch 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390
 but allows 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.620
 such is the new functionality 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.530
 catch doesn't hide in minus 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.140
 and carry 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 finger 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.440
 in order to increase something or less 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.460
 here is such 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.200
 usual 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.030
 Tulum furnaces just do not work need more 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.330
 I will show you once 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 put your finger like this 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.650
 zoom in for 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.930
 reduce it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.650
 and speed fell 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.680
 finger movements 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.090
 matching speed 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.520
 approximation or removal 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.850
 here we are formally if we need Kokoits 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.230
 fragment 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.770
 increase then here 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.190
 we are about there somewhere under attack 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.820
 that is, if you wish 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 all this can be done 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 well, where else does the new one work 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
 card firmware functionality 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.379
 chtpz 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.629
 means 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.290
 what do we have here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.559
 right here 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.369
 drink that zoom 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:25.539
 bad poor work 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
 increases 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.089
 that is, it is here 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.569
 breeding either 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 sliding your fingers 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.329
 Molina does not work 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.379
 although despite the fact that the screen 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.289
 capacitive 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.879
 all a little bit 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.119
 as it is unusual 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:49.279
 all the same sensitivity not 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.689
 as tall as 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.599
 let's say the best tank tank capacity 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.209
 Well, in general, the cards work 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.569
 it remains to see the browser 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.199
 from prince preinstalled 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.369
 page 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.559
 like a gadget 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.269
 dream zoom 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.769
 he is not quite 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.829
 works 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.069
 all this is done here is not as 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.499
 we'll see 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.079
 snapshots 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.449
 Well, that's probably all I wanted to show 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.479
 actually on it 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.249
 familiarity with this new firmware 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.549
 the word alimony 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.339
 finished thank you for your attention
