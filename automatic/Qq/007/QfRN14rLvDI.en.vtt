California today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.410> propagate<00:00:07.820> bamboo<00:00:08.820> from

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
how we're going to propagate bamboo from

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.930 
how we're going to propagate bamboo from
cuttings<00:00:10.099> there<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.370> different<00:00:11.639> kinds

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
cuttings there are two different kinds

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.509 
cuttings there are two different kinds
of<00:00:12.030> bamboo<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> clumping<00:00:13.920> kind<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
of bamboo one is the clumping kind and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.490 
of bamboo one is the clumping kind and
the<00:00:15.000> other<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.509> called<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> running<00:00:16.230> kind

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the other one is called the running kind

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.279 
the other one is called the running kind
the<00:00:17.250> running<00:00:17.670> kind<00:00:17.940> sends<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> runner<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the running kind sends out a runner and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.310 
the running kind sends out a runner and
they're<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.830> very<00:00:20.400> easy<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> propagate

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
they're very very easy to propagate

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.670 
they're very very easy to propagate
let's<00:00:22.320> show<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.560> how<00:00:24.170> from<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> stand<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
let's show you how from the stand of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580 
let's show you how from the stand of
bamboo<00:00:25.859> behind<00:00:26.580> me<00:00:26.900> we<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.289> runner

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
bamboo behind me we have this runner

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.310 
bamboo behind me we have this runner
that<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.949> come<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.929> extending<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> way

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that has come out extending all the way

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
that has come out extending all the way
out<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.700> clumps<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.270> bamboos

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
out here with two clumps of bamboos

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.130 
out here with two clumps of bamboos
already<00:00:34.440> started<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:36.059> easy<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
already started the easy way to do it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.310 
already started the easy way to do it
will<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> simply<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.820> plant

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
will be simply to take this one plant

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
will be simply to take this one plant
cut<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.800> either<00:00:40.950> end<00:00:41.309> dig<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
cut it off on either end dig it out and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
cut it off on either end dig it out and
plant<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.010> wanted<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> many

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
plant it if you wanted to have many

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
plant it if you wanted to have many
plants<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> bamboo<00:00:45.930> each<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.129> bumps

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
plants of bamboo each one of these bumps

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.439 
plants of bamboo each one of these bumps
along<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> runner<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.399> nodes<00:00:50.399> each<00:00:51.390> node

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
along the runner are nodes each node

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.630 
along the runner are nodes each node
will<00:00:52.440> produce<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.039> plant<00:00:54.350> however<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.399> cut

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
will produce a plant however if you cut

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
will produce a plant however if you cut
too<00:00:56.879> small<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.420> piece<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.870> might<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
too small of a piece it might not have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
too small of a piece it might not have
enough<00:00:58.559> energy<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> send<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.820> its

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
enough energy to be able to send up its

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.490 
enough energy to be able to send up its
own<00:01:00.680> plant<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> cut<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.879> couple<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
own plant so you want to cut a couple of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
own plant so you want to cut a couple of
buds<00:01:04.500> together<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.729> make<00:01:05.880> each<00:01:06.030> individual

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
buds together to make each individual

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
buds together to make each individual
plant<00:01:07.159> but<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:09.030> work<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
plant but for now let's work with the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.520 
plant but for now let's work with the
existing<00:01:09.900> plant<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:12.470> going<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
existing plant that we have going to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
existing plant that we have going to
take<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> shovel<00:01:14.390> place<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.600> near<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.790> part

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
take the shovel place it near the part

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.070 
take the shovel place it near the part
we<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.360> dig<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:21.390> course<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.840> slid

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
we want to dig up and of course it slid

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.010 
we want to dig up and of course it slid
right<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.280> piece<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.640> bamboo<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.780> try

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
right off the piece of bamboo let's try

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.260 
right off the piece of bamboo let's try
that<00:01:25.170> again

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
that again

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.260 
that again
here<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:28.579> cut<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.790> through<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> bamboo

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here we go cut right through the bamboo

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
here we go cut right through the bamboo
like<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.990> I'll<00:01:31.430> cut<00:01:32.430> around<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> other

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
like that I'll cut around on the other

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:48.090 
like that I'll cut around on the other
side<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> we'll<00:01:33.869> soon<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> plant

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200 

we're<00:01:49.100> going<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.310> take<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.580> little<00:01:49.820> piece<00:01:50.030> of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
we're going to take this little piece of
