00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.140 

I'm<00:02:11.890> still<00:02:12.130> kind<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.370> learning<00:02:12.580> how<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.819> use

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
I'm still kind of learning how to use

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930 
I'm still kind of learning how to use
this<00:02:13.420> thing<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.950> said<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.220> haven't<00:02:15.730> cut<00:02:15.910> it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
this thing like I said I haven't cut it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
this thing like I said I haven't cut it
or<00:02:16.150> styled<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> I'm<00:02:16.870> sure<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.380> did<00:02:17.440> I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
or styled it and I'm sure if I did I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.850 
or styled it and I'm sure if I did I
could<00:02:18.430> make<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.910> lot<00:02:19.090> easier<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.569> work<00:02:19.780> with

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
could make it a lot easier to work with

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.940 
could make it a lot easier to work with
but<00:02:20.860> um<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.489> best<00:02:21.730> thing<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.060> found<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.750> not<00:02:23.680> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
but um the best thing I found is not to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.000 
but um the best thing I found is not to
put<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.250> directly<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> middle<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.830> kind<00:02:26.830> of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
put it directly in the middle I kind of

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.220 
put it directly in the middle I kind of
put<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.670> little<00:02:27.700> bit<00:02:27.970> closer<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.540> your<00:02:28.989> right

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
put it a little bit closer to your right

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530 
put it a little bit closer to your right
side<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.940> would<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> middle

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
side as you see this would be the middle

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.600 
side as you see this would be the middle
it's<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> do<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.530> did<00:02:32.830> was<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.160> kind<00:02:33.519> of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
it's what I do it did was I kind of

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.110 
it's what I do it did was I kind of
angled<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.330> right<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.739> went<00:02:36.670> towards

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
angled it to the right and went towards

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.250 
angled it to the right and went towards
the<00:02:37.239> right<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:38.650> kind<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.950> went<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.600> and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the right it kind of went like so and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.199 
the right it kind of went like so and
then<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> just<00:02:41.860> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.069> clip<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.819> you

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
then you just kind of clip it and you

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.960 
then you just kind of clip it and you
can<00:02:43.530> clip<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> behind<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.160> bobby<00:02:45.370> pin<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:45.850> it

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
can clip it behind the bobby pin so it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.320 
can clip it behind the bobby pin so it
doesn't<00:02:46.239> show<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.010> easier<00:02:48.580> though<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.090> clip

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
doesn't show it is easier though to clip

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.870 
doesn't show it is easier though to clip
it<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:50.380> front<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> bobby<00:02:51.130> pins<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.790> they

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
it in front of the bobby pins and they

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.309 
it in front of the bobby pins and they
have<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.239> bobby<00:02:52.420> pins<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> back<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.170> they

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
have the bobby pins in the back but they

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.420 
have the bobby pins in the back but they
are<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.620> show<00:02:53.799> unless<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.160> have<00:02:54.400> like

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
are going to show unless you have like

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000 
are going to show unless you have like
black<00:02:54.910> ones<00:02:55.180> or<00:02:55.690> like<00:02:56.080> what<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> did<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.680> where

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
black ones or like what I did was where
