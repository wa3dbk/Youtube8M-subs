don't<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
don't know if you can see that but it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.810 
don't know if you can see that but it

thing<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.770> need<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
thing if you really need to do that I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.960 
thing if you really need to do that I
haven't<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.630> found<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> need<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
haven't really found a need for it

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.880

obviously<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.840> reversible<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.740> be

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
obviously it's not reversible to be

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
obviously it's not reversible to be
left-handed<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.210> i<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.570> wouldn't<00:01:51.689> expect

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
left-handed but i really wouldn't expect

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.960

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
if you need something a little bit

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
if you need something a little bit
stronger<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.550> got<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.970> little<00:02:27.030> guard<00:02:27.480> over

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
stronger it's got this little guard over

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.180 
stronger it's got this little guard over
the<00:02:27.900> bottom<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.380> blade<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.950> can

the bottom of the blade and you can

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.170 
the bottom of the blade and you can
certainly<00:02:29.780> get<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.320> nice<00:02:31.980> strong<00:02:32.490> grip<00:02:32.850> if<00:02:33.030> you

times in this fashion I think it was to
cut<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> piece<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.860> carpet<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:38.490> something<00:02:38.910> most

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
and yeah I know it doesn't look all

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.710 
and yeah I know it doesn't look all
tactical<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.860> there's<00:03:20.250> no<00:03:20.519> throwing<00:03:21.150> star<00:03:21.450> in

tactical and there's no throwing star in
the<00:03:21.840> handle<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:23.040> that's<00:03:23.280> really<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the handle but that's really one of the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.449 
the handle but that's really one of the
main<00:03:24.269> strengths<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:25.019> thing<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
main strengths of this thing is that it

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.840
