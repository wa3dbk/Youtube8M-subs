00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
bunch of players all playing at the same
time<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:28.980> makes<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.250> some<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.820> hectic

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
time and it makes for some really hectic

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
time and it makes for some really hectic
gameplay<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.080> tend<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.830> maps<00:00:32.099> /

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
gameplay I tend to like these maps /

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
gameplay I tend to like these maps /
just<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.820> general<00:00:33.239> straight<00:00:33.960> race<00:00:34.200> tracks

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
just your general straight race tracks

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
just your general straight race tracks
where<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.489> line<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.090> each<00:00:36.149> player

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
where you have one line for each player

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
where you have one line for each player
I<00:00:36.780> find<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.410> could<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:37.950> hectic<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I find these could get really hectic and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.310 
I find these could get really hectic and
also<00:00:38.940> allow<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.239> different<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> get

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
also allow for different people to get

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
also allow for different people to get
into<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> lead<00:00:40.860> by<00:00:41.340> messing<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.120> not

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
into the lead by messing up or not

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.049 
into the lead by messing up or not
exactly<00:00:42.750> making<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.559> jump<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.219> far<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
exactly making a jump as far as the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
exactly making a jump as far as the
aesthetics<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> actual<00:00:46.739> racetrack

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
aesthetics go and the actual racetrack

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
aesthetics go and the actual racetrack
itself<00:00:47.910> he<00:00:48.059> did<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.539> great<00:00:48.780> job<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
itself he did a really great job the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
itself he did a really great job the
entire<00:00:49.620> line<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.730> you're<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.180> enough<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
entire line if you're good enough you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
entire line if you're good enough you
can<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.320> each<00:00:52.530> jump<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.340> smooth<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can make it each jump is very smooth and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
can make it each jump is very smooth and
I<00:00:54.510> liked<00:00:54.750> how<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.289> used<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> natural

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
I liked how he really used the natural

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
I liked how he really used the natural
resources<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.840> had<00:00:58.109> given<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> fact

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
resources that he had given the fact

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
resources that he had given the fact
that<00:00:59.010> he<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.399> making<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.090> impact<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.930> lot

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that he is making this on impact a lot

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
that he is making this on impact a lot
of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> different<00:01:02.010> rocks<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.760> features<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
of the different rocks and features in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
of the different rocks and features in
the<00:01:03.750> racetrack<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:05.070> part<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the racetrack are actually part of the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.300 
the racetrack are actually part of the
map<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.330> created<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:07.020> himself<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.130> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
map and not created by himself so this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
map and not created by himself so this
adds<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> map<00:01:09.659> looks<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.439> also
