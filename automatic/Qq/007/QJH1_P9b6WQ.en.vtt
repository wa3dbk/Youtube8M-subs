00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.560
 please please 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.220
 okay in my case making a noise 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.220
 strange and in the curves have left the 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.500
 dripped grease and did the same thing bad 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.170
 from time to time so the car drives 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.149
 on the streets is no longer constant 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.980
 boy, to be honest I do not like this 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.219
 House stuff, I do not know you. 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.989
 I'll get repaired under good repair 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.989
 It's the next best I test, huh? 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.409
 Good, the problem is even in the board. 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.060
 homocinética is a piece like this one 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.220
 also set joint homokinetic gave 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.579
 to realize why they crack 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.939
 occurred in the curve or the problem is 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.280
 connected to the fixed joint on the wheel side but 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.789
 the defect could also be in the joint 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.099
 slider is a piece like 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.020
 this one but it does not have the state when 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.299
 accelerated trams accelerated the car and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.869
 athlete then the same homokinetic joint 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.770
 They are not who I say, nothing is so talking. 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.780
 Portuguese 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.420
 Look, care must be taken not to 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.599
 damage thing that protects the joint 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 because it can tear and one 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.489
 ripped the penetration of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.590
 for the inside of the hood and 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.720
 thus causing loss of the grease 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.880
 wear that deep marks that will 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.440
 cause noise is good will stay i guess 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 that I will never understand this thing of 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.569
 car or me 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.959
 walking and not letting me down for now 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.720
 is enough then the next day that I 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.079
 I make it there so that it will never happen again in the saga. 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.079
 the title 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.299
 Look at my recommendation is to make a 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.939
 evaluation between 5 and 10 thousand kilometers 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.220
 of the joint, especially of the 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.769
 that the rubber sleeve that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.150
 protects the part from contamination 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.420
 waste such as rain and mud 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.980
 the durability of the homokinetic joint 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.049
 can be extensive depending on the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.959
 conditions of use of the vehicle 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.750
 charge when you exit with the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.269
 car and vehicle can 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.280
 damage the workpiece 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.250
 in case of breakage of any of the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.159
 together the vehicle loses traction or 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.560
 he does not move towards 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.019
 in case of joint replacement 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.629
 homocinética, it is necessary to perform the 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.659
 alignment of the vehicle I have already 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.019
 Everything can let me do this. 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.019
 good luck 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.849
 ae
