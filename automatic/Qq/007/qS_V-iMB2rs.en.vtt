out of graphite we took a little bit of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.760 
out of graphite we took a little bit of
weight<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.230> you're<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.649> your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
weight out of it but you're in your

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
weight out of it but you're in your
critical<00:00:38.460> areas<00:00:38.910> where<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.600> your

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
critical areas where you have your your

main<00:00:40.110> gear<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.649> clutch<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.670> your

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
main gear your clutch and then your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
main gear your clutch and then your
drive<00:00:42.090> shaft<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:43.170> sacrificing<00:00:43.860> performance

the clutch does in fact slip and what's
going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> happen<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.140> reel<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.470> turn

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
going to happen is your reel will turn

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.640 
going to happen is your reel will turn
backwards<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.659> handle<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.020> turn<00:01:37.200> backwards

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
backwards the handle will turn backwards

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.990 
backwards the handle will turn backwards
the<00:01:37.740> key<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> remember<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> backup

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the key thing to remember is the backup

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
the key thing to remember is the backup
Pollin<00:01:39.420> ratchet<00:01:39.780> system<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.380> prevent<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
Pollin ratchet system will prevent that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920 
Pollin ratchet system will prevent that
so<00:01:41.369> you're<00:01:41.909> always<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> have

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so you're always going to have

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.330 
so you're always going to have
continuous<00:01:43.920> anti<00:01:44.430> reverse<00:01:44.579> 100%<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> time

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
where you've got your centrifugal

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.990 
where you've got your centrifugal
braking<00:03:17.870> system<00:03:18.260> now<00:03:18.530> you've<00:03:18.680> got<00:03:18.860> six<00:03:19.730> brake

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
braking system now you've got six brake

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.490 
braking system now you've got six brake
weights<00:03:20.269> total<00:03:21.040> all<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.370> way<00:03:22.459> from<00:03:22.700> zero<00:03:23.500> all

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
the way to total is six so if you want a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
the way to total is six so if you want a
lot<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> braking<00:03:27.230> power<00:03:27.410> all<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.070> got<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.280> do

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
lot of braking power all you got to do

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.699 
lot of braking power all you got to do
is<00:03:28.640> turn<00:03:28.850> this<00:03:29.150> dial<00:03:31.690> counterclockwise<00:03:32.709> and
