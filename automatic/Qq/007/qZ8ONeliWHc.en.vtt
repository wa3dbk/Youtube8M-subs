hi<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.350> Tommy<00:00:01.890> Dave<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.550> have<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> wild<00:00:03.060> talk

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319 
hi I'm Tommy Dave and I have a wild talk

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.650 
hi I'm Tommy Dave and I have a wild talk
you've<00:00:04.319> seen<00:00:04.529> me<00:00:04.680> repair<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.430> plane<00:00:05.910> from

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
you've seen me repair my plane from

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.700 
you've seen me repair my plane from
broken<00:00:07.140> wings<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:08.040> crushed<00:00:08.940> noses<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.690> now<00:00:09.750> in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
broken wings to crushed noses and now in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
broken wings to crushed noses and now in
my<00:00:10.740> last<00:00:11.010> video<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> saw<00:00:11.730> how<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> had<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.300> lent

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
my last video you saw how I had it lent

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.049 
my last video you saw how I had it lent
to<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.080> control<00:00:13.740> surfaces<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.820> I've<00:00:14.910> had<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to the control surfaces and I've had a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.240 
to the control surfaces and I've had a
great<00:00:15.509> time<00:00:15.900> I've<00:00:16.230> had<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.830> more<00:00:16.859> control

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
great time I've had a lot more control

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.410 
great time I've had a lot more control
over<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.550> plane<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:17.880> something<00:00:18.150> became

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
over the plane but something became

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.730 
over the plane but something became
apparent<00:00:18.690> something's<00:00:19.080> still<00:00:19.289> missing<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
apparent something's still missing in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.230 
apparent something's still missing in
the<00:00:19.830> plane<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.699> think<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> center<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the plane and I think the center of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720 
the plane and I think the center of
gravity<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> off<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> stick<00:00:23.699> around

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
gravity is off so if you stick around

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.770 
gravity is off so if you stick around
I'll<00:00:24.300> tell<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.160 

so<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.320> wild<00:00:33.620> hog<00:00:34.660> we've<00:00:35.660> got<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.960> nose

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
so with the wild hog we've got the nose

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.800 
so with the wild hog we've got the nose
and<00:00:36.890> there's<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.250> battery<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:38.480> started

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
and there's the battery and I started

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.870 
and there's the battery and I started
with<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> battery<00:00:40.040> back<00:00:40.310> where<00:00:40.580> it<00:00:40.670> was<00:00:40.760> sort

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
with the battery back where it was sort

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.549 
with the battery back where it was sort
of<00:00:41.000> supposed<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.330> be<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.080> found<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
of supposed to be and I found that the

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.870 
of supposed to be and I found that the
center<00:00:42.770> of<00:00:42.860> gravity<00:00:42.950> though<00:00:43.700> the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
center of gravity though the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
center of gravity though the
instructions<00:00:44.330> don't<00:00:44.420> tell<00:00:44.630> you<00:00:44.690> where<00:00:44.840> the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
instructions don't tell you where the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.720 
instructions don't tell you where the
center<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.170> gravity<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.530> supposed<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.830> be<00:00:46.010> it

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
center of gravity is supposed to be it

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.549 
center of gravity is supposed to be it
seemed<00:00:47.000> way<00:00:47.150> too<00:00:47.210> far<00:00:47.480> back<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.230> moved<00:00:48.500> the

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
seemed way too far back so I moved the

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.320 
seemed way too far back so I moved the
battery<00:00:48.949> I<00:00:49.070> cut<00:00:49.280> out<00:00:49.309> some<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.820> foam<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.150> I

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
battery I cut out some of the foam and I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.430 
battery I cut out some of the foam and I
move<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> factory<00:00:50.870> as<00:00:50.930> far<00:00:51.110> as<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.260> could

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
move the factory as far as I could

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.530 
move the factory as far as I could
forward<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.730> was<00:00:52.850> never<00:00:53.000> quite<00:00:53.210> sure<00:00:53.239> about

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
forward and I was never quite sure about

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.240 
forward and I was never quite sure about
it<00:00:53.690> cuz<00:00:53.809> I'm<00:00:53.900> still<00:00:54.110> learning<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.040> everything

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
it cuz I'm still learning and everything

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.610 
it cuz I'm still learning and everything
well<00:00:55.580> once<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.940> added<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.420> new<00:00:57.230> control

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
well once I added the new control

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.670 
well once I added the new control
surfaces<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.580> wild<00:00:58.910> Hawk<00:00:59.440> and<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.559> have

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
surfaces on to the wild Hawk and I have

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.290 
surfaces on to the wild Hawk and I have
a<00:01:00.710> lot<00:01:00.890> more<00:01:00.920> control<00:01:01.370> over<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.640> plane<00:01:01.820> it

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
a lot more control over the plane it

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.729 
a lot more control over the plane it
became<00:01:02.600> apparent<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.230> think<00:01:03.470> something

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
became apparent that I think something

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.990 
became apparent that I think something
else<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:03.950> wrong<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.369> was<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.670> center<00:01:04.910> of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
else is wrong and it was the center of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.889 
else is wrong and it was the center of
gravity<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:06.290> what<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.500> did<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.630> I'll<00:01:08.720> show<00:01:08.869> you

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
gravity so what I did and I'll show you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.969 
gravity so what I did and I'll show you
exactly<00:01:09.050> what<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.680> do

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
exactly what to do

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.469 
exactly what to do
as<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.399> move<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.700> center<00:01:10.910> of<00:01:10.940> gravity<00:01:11.030> forward

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
as I move the center of gravity forward

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.990 
as I move the center of gravity forward
by<00:01:11.720> adding<00:01:12.050> some<00:01:12.259> weight<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.640> in<00:01:13.880> this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
by adding some weight to it so in this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.460 
by adding some weight to it so in this
view<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.360> can<00:01:14.509> see<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.869> battery<00:01:15.110> work

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
view you can see the battery work

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.020 
view you can see the battery work
normally<00:01:16.250> was<00:01:16.399> set<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.640> in<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.759> next

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
normally was set and and in this next

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.830 
normally was set and and in this next
view<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:20.420> can<00:01:20.570> see<00:01:20.810> how<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.640> wild<00:01:22.640> hawk

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
view you can see how the the wild hawk

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.080 
view you can see how the the wild hawk
balances<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.979> its<00:01:25.160> old<00:01:25.369> position<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
balances in its old position with the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.340 
balances in its old position with the
battery<00:01:26.390> in<00:01:26.479> its<00:01:26.600> old<00:01:26.750> place<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.259> see

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
battery in its old place you can see

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.900 
battery in its old place you can see
it's<00:01:27.470> very<00:01:27.740> far<00:01:28.009> back<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> said<00:01:28.729> it's

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
it's very far back like I said it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.370 
it's very far back like I said it's
getting<00:01:29.210> close<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.509> halfway<00:01:29.690> back<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.289> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
getting close to halfway back on the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.499 
getting close to halfway back on the
wing

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
wing

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.190 
wing
so<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.350> I've<00:01:33.530> cut<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.009> hole<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.929> now<00:01:36.080> I've

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
so here I've cut the hole and now I've

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.050 
so here I've cut the hole and now I've
put<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.470> weight<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.039> I've<00:01:37.550> glued<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.940> with

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
put the weight and I've glued it with

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.550 
put the weight and I've glued it with
just<00:01:38.240> hot<00:01:38.390> glue<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:39.170> holds<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.470> in

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
just hot glue and that holds it in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.279 
just hot glue and that holds it in
pretty<00:01:39.830> well<00:01:40.420> now<00:01:41.420> I've<00:01:41.569> moved<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.899> battery

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
pretty well now I've moved the battery

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.699 
pretty well now I've moved the battery
up<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> forward<00:01:43.100> position<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.649> now<00:01:45.649> you

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
up to the forward position and now you

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.589 
up to the forward position and now you
can<00:01:45.979> see<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.700> balance<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:47.300> I've<00:01:47.420> moved

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
can see on the balance that I've moved

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.389 
can see on the balance that I've moved
it<00:01:47.810> very<00:01:48.020> far<00:01:48.229> forward<00:01:48.470> it's<00:01:48.649> about<00:01:48.890> two<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.340> a

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
it very far forward it's about two and a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.070 
it very far forward it's about two and a
quarter<00:01:49.610> inches<00:01:50.030> back<00:01:50.390> from<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.780> front<00:01:51.020> of

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
quarter inches back from the front of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.870 
quarter inches back from the front of
the<00:01:51.140> wing<00:01:51.349> and<00:01:51.530> that's<00:01:51.649> just<00:01:52.099> about<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:52.580> third

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
the wing and that's just about one third

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.940 
the wing and that's just about one third
of<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.060> way<00:01:53.349> from<00:01:54.349> the<00:01:54.470> front<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:54.770> wing

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
of the way from the front of the wing

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.580 
of the way from the front of the wing
I've<00:01:55.610> taken<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.090> plane<00:01:56.360> out<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.840> I've<00:01:57.140> flown

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
I've taken this plane out and I've flown

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.529 
I've taken this plane out and I've flown
it<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.160> performs<00:01:58.729> completely

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
it and it performs completely

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:00.820 
it and it performs completely
differently<00:01:59.929> it's<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.259> what<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:00.740> a

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
differently it's a what it's a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.550 
differently it's a what it's a
completely<00:02:01.399> different<00:02:01.670> font<00:02:02.090> plane<00:02:02.539> with<00:02:03.319> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
completely different font plane with the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.070 
completely different font plane with the
extra<00:02:03.979> control<00:02:04.340> surfaces<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.240> have<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> lot<00:02:05.959> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
extra control surfaces I have a lot of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.260 
extra control surfaces I have a lot of
control<00:02:06.349> over<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.590> plane<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:08.240> the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
control over the plane now and with the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.559 
control over the plane now and with the
weight<00:02:08.630> forward<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.550> flies<00:02:11.270> like<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
weight forward it just flies like a

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.199 
weight forward it just flies like a
dream<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.200> think<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.400> was<00:02:13.640> just<00:02:13.670> something

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
dream so I think that was just something

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.229 
dream so I think that was just something
I<00:02:14.390> didn't<00:02:14.690> understand<00:02:15.370> from<00:02:16.370> maybe<00:02:16.970> an<00:02:17.090> old

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
I didn't understand from maybe an old

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.330 
I didn't understand from maybe an old
hand<00:02:17.510> would<00:02:17.660> know<00:02:17.840> hopefully<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.010> will<00:02:19.130> save

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
hand would know hopefully this will save

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:30.180 
hand would know hopefully this will save
you<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.580> lot<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.930> time<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.349> an<00:02:21.920> effort

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.250 

you
