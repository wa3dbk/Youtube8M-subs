00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.799
 li x 35 and at hyundai the competitor 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.350
 qashqai kye gwan and others rav4 on 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.670
 the segment of compact suv as they 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 is available in two or four wheels 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.350
 motor but only in diesel x 35 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.580
 was restyled in 2013 with the program 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 two small aesthetic touches 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 especially on the front lights it does not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 proposes not less than five levels of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.350
 finish and remains the choice between the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 petrol engine of 136 horses or 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.329
 three diesel from 115 to 184 horses 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 we try the little diesel block of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.110
 115 horses only offered in two 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.050
 drive wheels associated here to the finish 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 high-end premium pack limited to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.899
 inside the restyling has almost 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 nothing changed compared to the first 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.770
 milling of 2010 we note the arrival of a 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.059
 new screen between the meters or 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.800
 some details about the materials 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.120
 on the counterports the plastics 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 remain hard but the presentation 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.730
 generally okay although 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 new qashqai is doing a lot better 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 now at the back the space is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 generous for 2 adults and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 comfortable benches except for one 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 possible third passenger the trunk 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.530
 reaches 465 cubic decimetres in the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.060
 average of the category just like the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 loading threshold a bit high in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
 the absolute we can ask the question 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.240
 115 horses will they be enough for a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 followed by this size answer yes 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.659
 no question of making time 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.369
 obviously but this little diesel is enough to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.840
 properly raise the gear that swallows 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.880
 even the freeway climbs without much 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 of problems in any case a vacuum a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.790
 good relative health allowed by 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.080
 box reports for once not too much 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.210
 lengthened and whose order is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.830
 relatively pleasant behavior 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 is not very dynamic in 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.950
 because of a redhead dismiss but still 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.439
 healthy and promoting comfort even with 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.060
 our 18 inch wheels 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.470
 side consumption this little diesel is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.909
 well the most sober of the range but 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.509
 figure far enough from the best of the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.880
 category 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.200
 hyundai announces 5 lille 2 of average and 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.490
 even five four beds with the wheels of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 18 inches of high-end finishing 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 of our test model what 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.270
 corresponds to 135 and 143 respectively 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 grams of co2 either 250 or 500 euros of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.990
 ecological malus 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 we are far from 3 and 8 average and 99 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.040
 grams per km of co2 announced by 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.390
 nissan on his qashqai halit 5 dci110 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.880
 for similar performance 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 the x 35 can not even claim to be 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.549
 cheaper especially in this version 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.549
 upscale at more than 32,000 euros
