hi<00:00:15.570> guys<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.049> joining<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> wire

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
hi guys this is joining from the wire

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.470 
hi guys this is joining from the wire
heads<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> here<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> quick

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
heads and here we're here with a quick

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.560 
heads and here we're here with a quick
tutorial<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.500> lock<00:00:19.770> picking<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.189> Skyrim<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
tutorial on lock picking in Skyrim it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.269 
tutorial on lock picking in Skyrim it
only<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.199> Skyrim<00:00:22.529> will<00:00:22.740> notice<00:00:23.070> there's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
only just got Skyrim will notice there's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.330 
only just got Skyrim will notice there's
a<00:00:23.340> change<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> lock<00:00:24.090> picking<00:00:24.330> system<00:00:25.340> this

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a change in the lock picking system this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.599 
a change in the lock picking system this
can<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.609> confusing<00:00:26.960> but<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> hang

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
can be confusing but as you get the hang

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.410 
can be confusing but as you get the hang
of<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.449> much<00:00:31.019> easier<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.090> n<00:00:33.239> log

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
of it it will be much easier so n log

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
of it it will be much easier so n log
picking<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> control<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.770> lock<00:00:34.980> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
picking you can control the lock with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.180 
picking you can control the lock with
the<00:00:35.460> AMD<00:00:36.030> keys<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.320> pick<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the AMD keys and you pick with them and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
the AMD keys and you pick with them and
the<00:00:38.370> pic<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> mouse<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.930> technique<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the pic with the mouse the technique is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
the pic with the mouse the technique is
to<00:00:40.649> adjust<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> pic<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.210> position

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to adjust the pic to the right position

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
to adjust the pic to the right position
then<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.950> turn<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.280> lock<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> open

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
then you can just turn the lock and open

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.590 
then you can just turn the lock and open
up<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> most<00:00:45.960> affected<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> most<00:00:48.090> effective

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
up the most affected the most effective

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
up the most affected the most effective
way<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.110> lock-picking<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.250> starve<00:00:50.520> your

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
way of lock-picking is to starve your

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.369 
way of lock-picking is to starve your
pic<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> middle<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.710> tap<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.699> D<00:00:53.940> key

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
pic in the middle and tap the a or D key

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
pic in the middle and tap the a or D key
if<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:56.039> starts<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> jitter<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.239> means<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
if it starts to jitter it means that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.500 
if it starts to jitter it means that
pics<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> break<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> need<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> stop

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
pics about to break so you need to stop

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.610 
pics about to break so you need to stop
you<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> adjust<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> left

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you then need to adjust it to the left

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
you then need to adjust it to the left
or<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> again<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
or right if it just is again you need to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
or right if it just is again you need to
stop<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> repeat<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> process<00:01:06.140> eventually

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
stop and repeat the process eventually

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510 
stop and repeat the process eventually
you're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> find<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.189> where<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you're going to find a point where it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
you're going to find a point where it
starts<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> turn<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.960> should<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.260> hold<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
starts to turn you should then hold the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
starts to turn you should then hold the
lot<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.700> should<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:11.880> hold<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> lock<00:01:12.960> key

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
lot you should then hold the lock key

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
lot you should then hold the lock key
for<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:13.799> longer<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> need<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> keep

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
for a little longer but you need to keep

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.230 
for a little longer but you need to keep
an<00:01:15.720> eye<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.409> pic<00:01:16.799> jittering<00:01:17.220> again<00:01:17.580> if

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
an eye for the pic jittering again if

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
an eye for the pic jittering again if
you<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> jitter<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> very

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you see a jitter then you make the very

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.660 
you see a jitter then you make the very
fine<00:01:20.790> adjustments<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.110> perfect

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
fine adjustments to get it just perfect

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.800 
fine adjustments to get it just perfect
so<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> look<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> clip<00:01:24.540> playing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
so if you look here the clip playing

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
so if you look here the clip playing
right<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> master<00:01:26.130> level<00:01:26.280> lock<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
right now is me a master level lock it's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.760 
right now is me a master level lock it's
not<00:01:27.090> great<00:01:27.390> example<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.619> at

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
not great example but it's all have at

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.120 
not great example but it's all have at
the<00:01:28.829> moment<00:01:29.509> if<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.720> notice<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> adjust

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the moment if you notice how I adjust

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.060 
the moment if you notice how I adjust
the<00:01:32.220> pic<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.079> when<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> jitters<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.860> then

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the pic and when it jitters I'm then

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
the pic and when it jitters I'm then
going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.340> change<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:36.590> unfortunately

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
going to change you around unfortunately

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.730 
going to change you around unfortunately
right<00:01:37.710> quite<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> few<00:01:38.159> pics<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.700> um<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:40.590> see

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
right quite a few pics here um you see

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.990 
right quite a few pics here um you see
what<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.220> been<00:01:41.310> doing<00:01:41.369> isn't<00:01:41.759> making

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
what you have been doing isn't making

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.380 
what you have been doing isn't making
much<00:01:42.299> smaller<00:01:42.750> adjustments<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> much

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
much smaller adjustments this is much

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.580 
much smaller adjustments this is much
more<00:01:45.420> efficient<00:01:46.909> also<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> lock

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
more efficient also as I see the lock

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.859 
more efficient also as I see the lock
turn<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.490> carried<00:01:50.880> away<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> hold<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> key

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
turn I get carried away and hold the key

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
turn I get carried away and hold the key
I<00:01:52.049> should<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.409> been<00:01:52.500> tapping<00:01:52.860> more<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I should have been tapping more and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.510 
I should have been tapping more and
looking<00:01:54.000> carefully<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.540> jitter<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> uh

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
looking carefully for the jitter so uh

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.999 
looking carefully for the jitter so uh
look<00:01:57.240> early<00:01:57.990> lock-picking<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.619> fairly<00:01:58.890> easy

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
look early lock-picking is fairly easy

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.090 
look early lock-picking is fairly easy
but<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.880> pick<00:02:00.180> hard<00:02:00.450> alox<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.409> sweet<00:02:01.799> spot

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
but as you pick hard alox the sweet spot

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.109 
but as you pick hard alox the sweet spot
is<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:02.850> specific<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> um<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:05.880> that
