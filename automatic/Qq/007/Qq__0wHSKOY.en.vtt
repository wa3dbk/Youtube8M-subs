00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.679
 allow the new number 10 one of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 four new arrivals the only known 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.970
 the bundesliga one of his 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.609
 perfectly suited to the tsg 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.430
 jonathan schmid came from sc freiburg 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.320
 oliver follows Baumann old known from 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 breisgau in the kraichgau reloaded quasi 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.910
 already talked to him a few times 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 the call there has always good told that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.850
 the boys see well and the team 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 also good and your trainers team too 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 good and i have also seen myself 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.420
 that the oven is at my good club 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.129
 now he is a part of him jonathan 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 Closes in Strasbourg and born 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 lived there a year ago despite 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 workplace in the well 90 kilometer 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 airline removed freiburg where he 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.239
 since 2008 played from the u19 to the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 Bundesliga 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.579
 next stop hoffheim yes that too 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 a next step for me because of me 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 I am very family and now my family 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.790
 also comes in rauenberg with my wife 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.439
 and my son 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.890
 and that's very important to me 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.570
 the two parts 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 that was not a good move from him 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 So now the TSG 10 carries a number 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 some people say with a special one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.979
 meaning in any case but one with 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 great previous owners yes I wanted these 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.560
 Number 10 because even in the younger time 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 I also had the number 10 and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.320
 I wanted to tell them because I have 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 asked if the free hours there was free 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.380
 coincidentally and only since 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 Recently, she wore a certain 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.399
 Brazilians are now on the island 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.090
 drew big footsteps 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.299
 No, why should I be special? 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.299
 Let's play then we'll see 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.150
 one can be confident in freiburg 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.950
 a performer just like his 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.909
 longtime friend and teammate 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.530
 oliver baumann integration no problem 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.470
 yes the guys have me very well 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.290
 recorded and that was a great group 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.250
 Great team and I think so too 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.610
 need is a time that I have several 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 be recorded 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.090
 But the us in the beginning made me feel good 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.100
 recorded 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.650
 the number one has led him to the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.630
 away from freiburg to tsg jonathan schmid 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.290
 has fulfilled and rather funny on 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.940
 establish 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.489
 tactically probably rather laterally 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.489
 but for it but in the 10th
