hello<00:00:00.390> YouTube<00:00:00.810> world<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.319> am<00:00:01.680> back<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.010> Germany

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hello YouTube world I am back in Germany

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello YouTube world I am back in Germany
and<00:00:02.760> what<00:00:03.720> you're<00:00:03.929> looking<00:00:04.140> at<00:00:04.410> here<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
and what you're looking at here is the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.650 
and what you're looking at here is the
new<00:00:05.490> setup<00:00:06.589> for<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:08.990> electrolyzer<00:00:10.820> in<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
new setup for the electrolyzer in the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.079 
new setup for the electrolyzer in the
left<00:00:12.870> hand<00:00:13.049> side<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.469> my<00:00:13.799> 8<00:00:14.370> by<00:00:14.610> 3<00:00:14.639> inch

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
left hand side I have my 8 by 3 inch

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.390 
left hand side I have my 8 by 3 inch
plates<00:00:15.859> or<00:00:17.119> series<00:00:18.619> get<00:00:19.619> no<00:00:19.770> closer<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
plates or series get no closer there you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.840 
plates or series get no closer there you
see<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.900> series<00:00:22.439> there<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.789> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
see all series there this one this is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000 
see all series there this one this is
another<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.960> hand<00:00:25.170> side<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.769> from

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
another right hand side is the one from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.089 
another right hand side is the one from
my<00:00:26.310> previous<00:00:27.349> electrolyzer<00:00:28.349> which<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.949> took

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
my previous electrolyzer which I took

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
my previous electrolyzer which I took
out<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:30.060> containers<00:00:30.480> eyeball<00:00:31.019> pretty

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
out these containers eyeball pretty

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.380 
out these containers eyeball pretty
cheap<00:00:31.560> they're<00:00:31.740> ten<00:00:31.920> dollars<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.489> found<00:00:33.270> these

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
cheap they're ten dollars I found these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.479 
cheap they're ten dollars I found these
really<00:00:33.570> easy<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.520> easy<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.850> open<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.750> close

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
really easy and easy to open and close

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.760 
really easy and easy to open and close
easy<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> work<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.110> their<00:00:40.110> acrylic<00:00:41.329> bottom

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
easy to work with their acrylic bottom

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.420 
easy to work with their acrylic bottom
petsmart<00:00:43.770> i<00:00:43.829> think<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:46.219> what<00:00:47.219> you're

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
petsmart i think it was and what you're

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240 
petsmart i think it was and what you're
looking<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.840> new<00:00:49.079> setup<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
looking at is the new setup I have a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.270 
looking at is the new setup I have a
theory<00:00:51.050> since<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.739> putting<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
theory since I'm going to be putting a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
theory since I'm going to be putting a
lot<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.670> amperage<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> while<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.710> was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
lot more amperage and while this was

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.810 
lot more amperage and while this was
going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.100> requiring<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> lot<00:00:56.699> more

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
going to be requiring a lot more

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.099 
going to be requiring a lot more
amperage<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> bigger<00:00:57.660> plate<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
amperage because the bigger plate to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
amperage because the bigger plate to
know<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.460> figured<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> water<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.789> i'm

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
know so I figured the water in here i'm

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.509 
know so I figured the water in here i'm
pretty<00:01:03.210> sure<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> heat<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.890> had

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
pretty sure is going to heat up so i had

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.210 
pretty sure is going to heat up so i had
a<00:01:05.549> theory<00:01:05.790> behind<00:01:06.060> using<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.020> hydrogen<00:01:07.530> build

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a theory behind using the hydrogen build

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
a theory behind using the hydrogen build
up<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.570> pass<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
up from this one to pass through this

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.910 
up from this one to pass through this
tube<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> gas<00:01:12.299> flows<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
tube and the gas flows through there on

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
tube and the gas flows through there on
the<00:01:13.979> top<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.270> goes

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the top of this one just this one goes

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
the top of this one just this one goes
to<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.869> bubbler<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:17.930> takes<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.229> hydrogen<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to my bubbler and takes the hydrogen and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
to my bubbler and takes the hydrogen and
oxygen<00:01:19.979> gas<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.600> bridge<00:01:21.869> here

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
oxygen gas from there the bridge here

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
oxygen gas from there the bridge here
i'm<00:01:23.070> hoping<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.330> cooling<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> gas

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
i'm hoping that the cooling of the gas

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.490 
i'm hoping that the cooling of the gas
it<00:01:25.680> flows<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> water<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:27.030> help

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
it flows through the water will help

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
it flows through the water will help
cool<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.799> site<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.520> try

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
cool this site and at the same time try

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
cool this site and at the same time try
to<00:01:29.970> transfer<00:01:30.479> some<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.229> cooling<00:01:31.619> back

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to transfer some but some cooling back

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.940 
to transfer some but some cooling back
to<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.479> side<00:01:33.720> which<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.590> going

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to this side which i don't think going

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
to this side which i don't think going
to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.130> producing<00:01:35.490> too<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:37.409> all

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to be producing too much but it's all

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
to be producing too much but it's all
theory<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.220> i'm<00:01:39.180> looking<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.079> some

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
theory right now i'm looking for some

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.270 
theory right now i'm looking for some
aquatic<00:01:41.479> temperature<00:01:42.479> strips<00:01:42.920> are<00:01:43.920> actually

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
aquatic temperature strips are actually

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.469 
aquatic temperature strips are actually
you<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.490> yeah<00:01:44.820> pretty<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.119> temperature

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you go yeah pretty much temperature

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
you go yeah pretty much temperature
temperature<00:01:46.110> strips<00:01:46.829> i<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> put<00:01:47.280> inside<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
temperature strips i can put inside that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
temperature strips i can put inside that
way<00:01:48.450> i<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> outside<00:01:49.110> what

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
way i can see it from the outside what

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310 
way i can see it from the outside what
the<00:01:49.799> temperature<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.220> inside<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> water<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.049> i

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the temperature is inside the water so i

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
the temperature is inside the water so i
didn't<00:01:52.530> want<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> use<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.220> electronic<00:01:53.970> stuff

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
didn't want to use any electronic stuff

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090 
didn't want to use any electronic stuff
at<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.630> time<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.079> put<00:01:55.259> any<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.530> holes<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
at this time to put any more holes in it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
at this time to put any more holes in it
so<00:01:56.340> i<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:56.759> want<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so i don't want to we can be the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.430 
so i don't want to we can be the
container<00:01:59.009> itself<00:01:59.369> it's

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
container itself it's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.850 
container itself it's
that's<00:02:00.860> my<00:02:01.720> setup<00:02:02.720> still<00:02:03.470> working<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:03.800> the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
that's my setup still working on the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.700 
that's my setup still working on the
bubbler<00:02:04.160> because<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.370> got<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.610> change<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.510> from

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
bubbler because I got to change it from
