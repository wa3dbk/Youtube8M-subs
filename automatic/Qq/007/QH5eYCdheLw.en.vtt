shoot<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.360> we<00:01:15.080> figured<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.890> know<00:01:15.920> why<00:01:16.159> not

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
shoot now so we figured you know why not

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.580 
shoot now so we figured you know why not
build<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.970> replica<00:01:17.479> tank<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:18.350> someone

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
build a replica tank so I think someone

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
build a replica tank so I think someone
go<00:01:18.680> back<00:01:18.970> well<00:01:19.970> actually<00:01:20.090> we'll<00:01:20.570> call<00:01:20.810> our

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
go back well actually we'll call our

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.920 
go back well actually we'll call our
paintball<00:01:21.290> tank<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.710> tank

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
paintball tank a tank

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.010 
paintball tank a tank
just<00:01:24.830> got<00:01:24.980> a<00:01:25.010> cartridge<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.930> filled<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
just got a cartridge and filled the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.740 
just got a cartridge and filled the
paintballs<00:01:27.760> breech-loading<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.390> load<00:01:29.600> it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
paintballs breech-loading so you load it

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.860 
paintballs breech-loading so you load it
in<00:01:29.870> from<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.170> back<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:32.000> air<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.510> in<00:01:32.660> pretty

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
in from the back the air can in pretty

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.380 
in from the back the air can in pretty
much<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.650> steel<00:01:33.980> pipe<00:01:34.190> with<00:01:34.880> some

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
much so it's just a steel pipe with some

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.780 
much so it's just a steel pipe with some
outer<00:01:35.570> shrouds<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.290> then<00:01:36.740> side<00:01:37.040> there<00:01:37.370> you've

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
outer shrouds and then side there you've

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.940 
outer shrouds and then side there you've
got<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.000> pressure<00:01:38.330> chamber<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.050> you<00:01:39.290> fill<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.860> up

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
got a pressure chamber so you fill it up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980 
got a pressure chamber so you fill it up
to<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> high<00:01:40.280> pressure<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:41.240> paintballs<00:01:41.780> in

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
to a high pressure with paintballs in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.590 
to a high pressure with paintballs in
pull<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.890> trigger<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:44.000> will<00:01:44.420> use<00:01:44.570> that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
pull the trigger and it will use that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.050 
pull the trigger and it will use that
air<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.170> shoot<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:45.560> out<00:01:45.710> just<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.190> giant<00:01:46.729> spit

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
air to shoot this out just a giant spit

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.719 
air to shoot this out just a giant spit
ball<00:01:47.240> gun<00:01:47.450> we've<00:01:48.200> got<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> scuba<00:01:48.680> tank<00:01:48.830> inside

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
ball gun we've got a scuba tank inside

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.330 
ball gun we've got a scuba tank inside
and<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.780> use<00:01:50.900> that<00:01:51.140> it'll<00:01:51.860> give<00:01:52.010> us<00:01:52.100> enough

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and we use that it'll give us enough

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.880 
and we use that it'll give us enough
pressure<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.240> maybe<00:01:53.630> 50<00:01:54.470> shots

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
pressure for maybe 50 shots

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.820 
pressure for maybe 50 shots
it's<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:56.000> three<00:01:56.270> cylinder<00:01:56.570> diesel<00:01:56.899> engine<00:01:57.440> used

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's a three cylinder diesel engine used

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.090 
it's a three cylinder diesel engine used
to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> generator<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:59.570> my<00:01:59.690> co-op<00:01:59.899> jobs<00:02:00.229> at<00:02:01.070> a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
to be a generator on my co-op jobs at a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.999 
to be a generator on my co-op jobs at a
generator<00:02:01.580> factory<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.740> they're<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.950> to

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
generator factory and they're going to

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.040 
generator factory and they're going to
throw<00:02:04.160> it<00:02:04.280> out<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:04.700> they<00:02:05.360> let<00:02:05.509> me<00:02:05.540> have<00:02:05.810> it

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
throw it out so they let me have it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.290 
throw it out so they let me have it
we<00:02:07.040> built<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.490> put<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.910> all<00:02:08.030> back<00:02:08.149> together

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
we built it put it all back together

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.540 
we built it put it all back together
make<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.140> work<00:02:09.320> in<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.739> all<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.220> need<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.520> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
make it work in here all you need is a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.610 
make it work in here all you need is a
slow-moving<00:02:11.090> vehicle<00:02:11.810> side<00:02:11.989> apparently<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
slow-moving vehicle side apparently and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.699 
slow-moving vehicle side apparently and
it's<00:02:13.070> technically<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.150> tractor<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.080> put<00:02:15.590> an

it's technically a tractor and put an

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.990 
it's technically a tractor and put an
orange<00:02:15.860> triangle<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.489> there<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.790> drive

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
orange triangle on there you can drive

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
orange triangle on there you can drive
it<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.239> road<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.810> lot<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.230> people<00:02:18.470> think

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it on the road a lot of people think

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040 
it on the road a lot of people think
it's<00:02:18.800> cool<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.340> some<00:02:20.060> people<00:02:20.360> some<00:02:20.750> people

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050
