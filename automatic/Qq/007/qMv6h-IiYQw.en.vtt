00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
overseeing the film so what I'm assuming

overseeing the film so what I'm assuming
they're<00:01:20.430> gonna<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.909> hopefully<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
they're gonna do hopefully this is the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.160 
they're gonna do hopefully this is the
case<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.710> maybe<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.689> they're<00:01:24.930> going

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
case is maybe for this one they're going

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.450 
case is maybe for this one they're going
to<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.189> all<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to I don't think they can do all of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
to I don't think they can do all of
neural<00:01:26.970> 2<00:01:27.119> part<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:28.140> shot<00:01:28.470> that'd<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
neural 2 part one and one shot that'd be

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.749 
neural 2 part one and one shot that'd be
way<00:01:29.130> too<00:01:29.189> much<00:01:29.549> maybe<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.950> half<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
way too much maybe they can do half of
