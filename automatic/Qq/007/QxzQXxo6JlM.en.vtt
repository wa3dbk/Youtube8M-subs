that<00:00:35.469> means<00:00:35.679> that<00:00:35.979> we<00:00:36.159> were<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.579> fact<00:00:36.819> there

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329

so we're shining a laser on the lunar
Highlands<00:01:12.010> now<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.970> we're<00:01:13.360> getting<00:01:13.450> nothing

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.770 
in front of us not just thrilling
but<00:02:17.770> conclusive<00:02:18.640> look<00:02:19.090> I'd<00:02:19.330> love<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.750> to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
but conclusive look I'd love to go to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.620 
but conclusive look I'd love to go to
the<00:02:19.959> moon<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.920> can't<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.700> least<00:02:21.760> not<00:02:22.450> right

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the moon but I can't at least not right

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170 
the moon but I can't at least not right
now<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:23.860> did<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> next<00:02:24.370> best<00:02:24.459> thing<00:02:24.760> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
now so we did the next best thing you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.640 
now so we did the next best thing you
shine<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.450> laser<00:02:25.780> at<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.200> moon<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
shine that laser at the moon on the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.860 
shine that laser at the moon on the
second<00:02:27.010> test<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:27.760> got<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> clear<00:02:28.450> spike

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
second test and we got a clear spike

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.320 
second test and we got a clear spike
back<00:02:29.170> photons<00:02:30.069> came<00:02:30.400> back<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.700> our<00:02:30.730> receptor

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
back photons came back to our receptor

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.570 
back photons came back to our receptor
now<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.989> only<00:02:32.530> way<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:33.040> could<00:02:33.220> happen

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
now the only way that that could happen

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.009 
now the only way that that could happen
is<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.300> was<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> piece<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.630> manmade

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
is if there was a piece of manmade

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.309 
is if there was a piece of manmade
equipment<00:02:35.709> up<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.819> moon<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.569> reflect<00:02:38.050> them

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
equipment up on the moon to reflect them

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.490 
equipment up on the moon to reflect them
back<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.340> get<00:02:39.670> over<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.319> there's<00:02:41.319> no

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
back so get over it there's no

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.220 
back so get over it there's no
conspiracy<00:02:41.830> here<00:02:42.310> we've<00:02:42.970> been<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:43.540> we've

done that in response I have pointed out

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.680 
done that in response I have pointed out

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
incorrect to say that it is impossible

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.030

another question I wanted to ask you
about<00:03:53.109> no<00:03:53.890> there's<00:03:54.310> more<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.519> correction

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
about no there's more of a correction

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.849 
about no there's more of a correction
also<00:03:55.090> know<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.079> program<00:03:56.230> basically

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
also know that on the program basically

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.740 
also know that on the program basically
