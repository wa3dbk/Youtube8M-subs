00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.240 

there's<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> little<00:03:18.900> bit<00:03:18.990> of<00:03:19.080> heat<00:03:19.260> there's<00:03:20.160> a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
little bit of heat to it but it's not

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.110 
little bit of heat to it but it's not
intense<00:03:22.490> it's<00:03:23.490> got<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.030> would<00:03:24.600> say<00:03:24.750> almost<00:03:24.960> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
intense it's got I would say almost the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.940 
intense it's got I would say almost the
almost<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.210> flavoring<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.780> smoked<00:03:28.380> barbecue

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
almost a flavoring of a smoked barbecue

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.480 
almost a flavoring of a smoked barbecue
I<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:31.140> course<00:03:31.290> don't<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.800> taste<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> rib

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
I of course don't really taste the rib

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.120 
I of course don't really taste the rib
aspect<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.210> it<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.380> barbecue<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:34.950> pretty

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
aspect of it but the barbecue is pretty

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.390 
aspect of it but the barbecue is pretty
good<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.750> think<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.320> would<00:03:37.530> say<00:03:37.740> though<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.220> this

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
good I think I would say though if this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640 
good I think I would say though if this
flavoring<00:03:38.970> was<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.300> standard<00:03:40.170> chip<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
flavoring was on a standard chip like a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.910 
flavoring was on a standard chip like a
like<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.550> regular<00:03:41.790> potato<00:03:42.120> chip<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.620> would<00:03:43.770> be

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
like a regular potato chip it would be

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.910 
like a regular potato chip it would be
an<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.820> would<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.120> an<00:03:45.239> average<00:03:45.570> flavor<00:03:46.410> chip

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
an it would be an average flavor chip

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.479 
an it would be an average flavor chip
being<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> barbecue<00:03:48.000> itself<00:03:48.420> isn't

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
being that the barbecue itself isn't

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.699 
being that the barbecue itself isn't
fantastic<00:03:50.690> but<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.290> fact<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.560> they're

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
fantastic but the fact that they're

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.949 
fantastic but the fact that they're
incorporating<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.280> into<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.459> corn<00:03:54.000> chip<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
incorporating it into a corn chip the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.380 
incorporating it into a corn chip the
corn<00:03:55.260> chip<00:03:55.470> certainly<00:03:55.920> enhances<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.970> flavor

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
corn chip certainly enhances the flavor

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.360 
corn chip certainly enhances the flavor
of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.260> barbecue<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:58.980> they've<00:03:59.160> got

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
of the barbecue that they've got

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.000 
of the barbecue that they've got
seasoned<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:01.260> seasoning<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.770> its

seasoned on here the seasoning on its

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.280 
seasoned on here the seasoning on its
own<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:03.030> think<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.480> spectacular

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
own I don't think is spectacular

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.680 
own I don't think is spectacular
as<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.800> taste<00:04:05.190> tastes<00:04:05.520> like<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.060> smoky

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
as a taste tastes like just a smoky

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.229 
as a taste tastes like just a smoky
barbecue<00:04:06.989> flavor<00:04:07.620> however<00:04:08.400> having<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
barbecue flavor however having on the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.600 
barbecue flavor however having on the
corn<00:04:09.480> chip<00:04:09.690> definitely<00:04:10.440> excels<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.280> flavor

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
corn chip definitely excels the flavor

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.199 
corn chip definitely excels the flavor
level<00:04:12.120> from<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.140> level<00:04:13.350> 8<00:04:13.709> ho-hum<00:04:14.640> flavor
