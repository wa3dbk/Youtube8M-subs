00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.640
 does not work very well compared to 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.470

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.470
 accuracy of the transfer of mouse movements on 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.119

 Andrew Wilson Executive Director 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.230
 Electronics Arts gave microsoft and sony 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.640
 just a few years of rest before on 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.160
 the market will have new unique 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.020
 sentences from apple and google by words 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.540
 chapters and hey quite soon in the market 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.000
 there will be new competitors who can 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.340
 offer gamers something more and more 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.360
 more alluring than playstation 4 and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.700
 xbox one 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.680
 Wilson said our market continues 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.380
 evolve very very quickly 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.630
 I think microsoft and sony have great 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.850
 the ability to create a strong player base 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.530

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.930
 entertainment for big screens 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.430
 it seems to me in four years to companies 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.770
 will have to get involved in a serious 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.140
 competition for gamers living room 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.870
 with mobile companies including apple 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.020
 google rock and comcast which will be released on 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.060

 Will appear at gamers in five years on 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.210
 According to the head, electronics art can 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.000
 become so the most profitable 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.730

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.780
 officially support such

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.900
 the console's hard disk is possible without much 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.490
 labor change that may affect 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.280
 download speeds
