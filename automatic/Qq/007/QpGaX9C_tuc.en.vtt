I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.650> did<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.130> good<00:00:53.280> job<00:00:53.340> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I think they did a really good job of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.190 
I think they did a really good job of
creating<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.300> kind<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> seamless<00:00:54.960> line

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
creating this kind of seamless line

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.290 
creating this kind of seamless line
between<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.920> video<00:00:56.130> game<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> film<00:00:57.060> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
between the video game and the film so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700 
between the video game and the film so
that<00:00:57.420> people<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.810> feel<00:00:58.020> their<00:00:58.260> experience

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that people can feel their experience

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
that people can feel their experience

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
story that's really gonna build up to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
story that's really gonna build up to
the<00:01:03.270> movie<00:01:03.630> in<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.860> think

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
like it's one big piece while we were

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
like it's one big piece while we were
making<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.540> film<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.899> had<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> video<00:01:34.530> game

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
making the film we had the video game
very<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.310> mind<00:01:35.550> in<00:01:35.790> fact<00:01:36.000> you'd<00:01:36.390> be

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
very much in mind in fact you'd be

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
very much in mind in fact you'd be
shooting<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.560> important<00:01:38.009> scenes<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.490> would

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
shooting very important scenes we would

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
shooting very important scenes we would
think<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.149> point<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.690> gamers<00:01:40.140> are

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
think at this point the gamers are

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.359 
think at this point the gamers are
really<00:01:40.410> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.649> able<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> key<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.190> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really going to be able to key into this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
really going to be able to key into this
point<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> understand<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.050> they<00:01:43.320> were<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
point and understand but they were the

what's down that street or in those

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
what's down that street or in those
mountains<00:01:58.319> or<00:01:58.830> behind<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.429> door<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.179> was

mountains or behind that door this was

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.699 
mountains or behind that door this was
thought<00:02:00.569> through<00:02:00.869> these<00:02:01.080> two<00:02:01.289> things<00:02:01.530> were

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
thought through these two things were

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.790 
thought through these two things were
intended<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:03.149> better<00:02:03.380> together<00:02:04.380> than<00:02:04.500> as

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
intended to look better together than as

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800

separate<00:02:05.490> books<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.060> real<00:02:06.240> trick<00:02:06.569> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
separate books the real trick is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
separate books the real trick is
standing<00:02:07.410> apart<00:02:07.770> yet<00:02:08.100> still<00:02:08.420> meshing<00:02:09.420> really

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
standing apart yet still meshing really

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:19.510 
standing apart yet still meshing really
nicely<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.289> movie
