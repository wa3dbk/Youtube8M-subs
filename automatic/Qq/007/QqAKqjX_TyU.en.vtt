 truly intrigued that they have made a mix of two genres 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.169
 musicals that apparently 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.730

 this is something 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.280
 interesting because subversive material is called that this the truth to me 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.790
