to<00:02:43.900> me<00:02:44.560> that's<00:02:45.310> television<00:02:46.030> weight<00:02:46.209> should<00:02:46.450> be

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
to me that's television weight should be

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.550 
to me that's television weight should be
d-generation<00:02:47.440> X<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:48.220> NWO

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
d-generation X or NWO

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.680 
d-generation X or NWO
I'd<00:02:50.560> say<00:02:50.890> degeneration<00:02:51.550> actually<00:02:52.150> III<00:02:52.480> I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
I'd say degeneration actually III I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.250 
I'd say degeneration actually III I
think<00:02:53.250> not<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> slide<00:02:54.790> on<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.150> NWO<00:02:55.660> but<00:02:56.080> they

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
think not a slide on the NWO but they

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.290 
think not a slide on the NWO but they
were<00:02:56.320> younger<00:02:56.800> they<00:02:57.190> were<00:02:57.220> cooler<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:58.239> were

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
were younger they were cooler they were

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.350 
were younger they were cooler they were
hipper<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.709> sometimes<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.610> NWO<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.300> I

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
hipper I think sometimes the NWO and I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.270 
hipper I think sometimes the NWO and I
love<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> NWO<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.320> was<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.560> huge<00:03:02.769> fan<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.040> those

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
love the NWO I was a huge fan of those

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.850 
love the NWO I was a huge fan of those
but<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.239> sometimes<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.560> age

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
but I think sometimes you know the age

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.150 
but I think sometimes you know the age
did<00:03:06.370> come<00:03:06.640> across<00:03:06.780> where<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:08.019> with<00:03:08.320> DX<00:03:08.800> they

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
did come across where as with DX they

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.430 
did come across where as with DX they
were<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.489> lot<00:03:09.880> younger<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.660> think<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.200> age

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
were a lot younger and I think the age

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.640 
were a lot younger and I think the age
made<00:03:11.950> them<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.190> little<00:03:12.489> bit<00:03:12.670> more<00:03:12.940> dangerous

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
made them a little bit more dangerous

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.300 
made them a little bit more dangerous
because<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.739> didn't<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:14.980> what<00:03:15.040> they<00:03:15.220> were

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
because you didn't know what they were

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.100 
because you didn't know what they were
capable<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.820> okay<00:03:16.239> very<00:03:16.510> well<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.050> my
