thoughts and I kind of always stood by

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.970 
thoughts and I kind of always stood by
them<00:03:46.890> regardless<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.390> trouble<00:03:49.200> or<00:03:49.380> drama

or what entertaining users may have

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.360 
or what entertaining users may have
caused<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:54.000> Mecca<00:03:54.540> Stefano<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.560> opposed<00:03:56.010> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
caused it's Mecca Stefano as opposed to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.120 
caused it's Mecca Stefano as opposed to
just<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.360> website<00:03:58.020> with<00:03:58.320> different<00:03:58.680> writers

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
just the website with different writers

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.830 
just the website with different writers
writing<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.820> i<00:03:59.910> think<00:04:00.000> possibly<00:04:00.540> that's

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
writing for it i think possibly that's

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240 
writing for it i think possibly that's
where<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> difference<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.220> think

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
where the difference is and I think

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.400 
where the difference is and I think
that's<00:04:02.730> possibly<00:04:03.270> where<00:04:03.900> people<00:04:04.170> can

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
that's possibly where people can

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.110 
that's possibly where people can
actually<00:04:04.920> relate<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.120> person<00:04:06.660> who<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
actually relate to the person who is

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.250 
actually relate to the person who is
informing<00:04:09.120> them<00:04:09.270> or<00:04:09.510> telling<00:04:09.840> them<00:04:10.020> or

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
informing them or telling them or

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.170 
informing them or telling them or
getting<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.620> message<00:04:10.950> across<00:04:11.070> as<00:04:11.520> opposed<00:04:11.850> to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
getting the message across as opposed to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.900 
getting the message across as opposed to
it<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.140> being<00:04:13.380> like<00:04:13.530> another<00:04:13.890> magazine<00:04:14.190> or
