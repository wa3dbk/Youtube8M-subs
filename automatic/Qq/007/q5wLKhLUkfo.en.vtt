00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
is best-case scenario but $25,000 real

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:47.260 
is best-case scenario but $25,000 real
dollars<00:04:38.479> at<00:04:38.990> least<00:04:39.259> to<00:04:40.250> get<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.639> thing<00:04:40.880> done

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.650

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
sentimental value to I just think that

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.860

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
we could do this car

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.410 
we could do this car
the<00:04:55.960> money<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.100> make<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.580> really<00:04:58.240> nice

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
autocross with it here and there

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.260 
autocross with it here and there
sure<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.140> could<00:05:04.410> drum<00:05:04.590> up<00:05:04.740> some<00:05:05.270> performance

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
sure I could drum up some performance

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.730 
sure I could drum up some performance
parts<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.720> make<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:06.990> thing<00:05:07.170> handle<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.590> little

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
parts to make this thing handle a little

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.200 
parts to make this thing handle a little
bit<00:05:08.010> better<00:05:08.160> than<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.850> we<00:05:08.910> got<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.510> mean

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
bit better than this and we got I mean

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.520 
bit better than this and we got I mean
there's<00:05:12.210> quite<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.510> bit<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.780> body<00:05:13.050> roll<00:05:13.200> and
