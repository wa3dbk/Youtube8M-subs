00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.850
 author of a spectacular turnaround 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.520
 laval came out of the red zone the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.560
 tango are 16th of the ranking a point 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.570
 advanced on the 18th place 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.940
 we must continue on this effort and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.760
 get one or more points on the field 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.470
 of arles-avignon 13th a team of arles 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.300
 avignon who seem out of business 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.950
 but which is far too far from the top 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.320
 of the standings to hope for something 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.780
 the players of arles-avignon who are evolving 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.280
 in abdelamid suspended and go injured 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.570
 for laval the mission is difficult because 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 the men of franck dumas have lost 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.730
 only once this season to 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.239
 home the first goal and for arles 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.499
 avignon 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.609
 a goal from jordan adeoti against his side 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.319
 really no success for the 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.159
 Beninese international defender after 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.659
 only ten minutes 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.639
 arles avignon leads 1 0 a gift goal 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.889
 for the local team and Laval 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:07.729
 did not need to scuttle the 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:11.979
 so they had a hard time reacting but 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.979
 finally begins to find solutions 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.470
 and this center does not find takers 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.840
 a private laval team from mimoun 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.770
 Suspended and still malik couturier 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.140
 injured at mid-time arles avignon leads 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.840
 1 0 even though laval managed to react in 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 the game still no modification of the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.770
 bulletin board for now 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.590
 the team coached by denis zanko and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.690
 trap and fall back into his 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.670
 laval who won four of his 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.800
 last six matches it's an excellent 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.780
 pace to hope to stay in league 2 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.850
 while arles-avignon a little bit 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.480
 hanging out lately a victory 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.340
 on the last 11 games only in 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.380
 second period laval accelerates for 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.150
 mark at least the lute that would 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.190
 to get a good outside point 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.480
 attempts for christian bekamenga is 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.640
 one of the best scorers of the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.590
 championship fails to score 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.250
 why not with this ball in 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.009
 depth 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.080
 touched by the goalkeeper but the second 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.480
 striking is victorious butelle ludovic 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 failed to save enough the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.640
 situation facing amara baby 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.099
 who had more in the 64th ideas 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.200
 minute is the equalization to one everywhere 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.000
 fifth goal of the season for amara 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 baby arles avignon who has a ball of 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 match with that shot that misses 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.090
 the nervousness then in this end of 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.370
 match of franck dumas the referee of the match 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.349
 to johan hamel invites the coach 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.200
 d'arles avignon returned to the stands 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.480
 it is excluded but it does not change anything 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.280
 everywhere between arles avignon and laval est 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.640
 so a good point on the outside for the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 Laval
