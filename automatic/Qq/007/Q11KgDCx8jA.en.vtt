and<00:01:00.410> after<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.770> we're<00:01:01.250> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.400> do<00:01:01.550> is

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
and after that we're going to do is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700 
and after that we're going to do is

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
D string so and we're going to go six

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.590 
D string so and we're going to go six
for<00:01:07.400> two<00:01:07.700> with<00:01:07.970> that

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.450 

and<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:12.260> we're<00:01:12.440> gonna<00:01:12.530> go<00:01:12.800> straight<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.340> to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and then we're gonna go straight up to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.240 
and then we're gonna go straight up to
the<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> string<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:15.080> slide<00:01:15.500> from<00:01:15.740> B<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.070> C
