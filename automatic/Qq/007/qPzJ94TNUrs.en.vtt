00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the question we've all had on our minds

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
the question we've all had on our minds
no<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.760> final<00:00:24.060> version<00:00:24.210> wasn't<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.779> that

different<00:00:25.410> from<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> work<00:00:25.740> right<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.070> fact<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
different from the work right in fact it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670 
different from the work right in fact it
was<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.180> similar<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:27.810> personally<00:00:28.230> feel

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
was so similar that I've personally feel

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.140 
was so similar that I've personally feel
like<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> goober<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.789> watching<00:00:30.090> in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
like a bit of a goober for watching in

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
like a bit of a goober for watching in
the<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:30.420> place<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.990> was<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.590> hoping<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the first place I was really hoping the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.680 
the first place I was really hoping the
workprint<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.430> saw<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> version<00:00:33.390> Gavin

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
workprint we saw was the version Gavin

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.479 
workprint we saw was the version Gavin
hood<00:00:33.840> had<00:00:33.989> before<00:00:34.350> Fox<00:00:34.649> spent<00:00:34.950> those<00:00:35.070> millions

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
hood had before Fox spent those millions

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
hood had before Fox spent those millions
but<00:00:35.820> instead<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> seems<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> work<00:00:37.230> print

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but instead it seems like the work print

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
but instead it seems like the work print
may<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.950> actually<00:00:38.100> been<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> final<00:00:39.030> version

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
may have actually been the final version

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
may have actually been the final version
