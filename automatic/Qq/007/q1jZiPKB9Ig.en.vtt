rated so I just want to really quick
make<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.280> video<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> say<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:43.340> ninety-nine

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
make this video and say that ninety-nine

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700 
make this video and say that ninety-nine
point<00:00:44.820> nine<00:00:44.969> nine<00:00:45.149> percent<00:00:45.989> sure<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
point nine nine percent sure that it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.029 
point nine nine percent sure that it
will<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.890> pg-13<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.260> highly<00:00:49.260> doubt<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.890> be

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
will be pg-13 I highly doubt it will be

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.389 
will be pg-13 I highly doubt it will be
our<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.660> guess<00:00:51.930> PG<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.160> more

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
our and I guess PG is a little bit more

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
our and I guess PG is a little bit more
likely<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.020> we've<00:00:55.170> seen<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
likely but from what we've seen of the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
likely but from what we've seen of the
trailers<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.910> deaths<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.660> been<00:00:57.809> had

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
trailers the deaths that have been had

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
trailers the deaths that have been had
that<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.590> happened<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.760> most<00:01:00.180> definitely

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that have happened it's most definitely

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.969 
that have happened it's most definitely
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.469> pg-13<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.750> like<00:01:03.949> Jurassic<00:01:04.949> Park

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
has always kind of pushed the boundaries

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.910 
has always kind of pushed the boundaries
of<00:01:07.049> pg-13<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> i<00:01:09.000> absolutely<00:01:09.299> love<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.920> the

of pg-13 and i absolutely love that the
they<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:12.180> shy<00:01:12.570> away<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:13.049> violence<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
they don't shy away from violence and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.469 
they don't shy away from violence and
stuff<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.270> really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
stuff like that so just really really

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.039 
stuff like that so just really really
excited<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:21.439> experience<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:24.049> believe

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
excited to experience this and I believe

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.859 
excited to experience this and I believe
every<00:01:25.560> single<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> movies<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:27.630> has

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
every single one of the movies it has

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
every single one of the movies it has
been<00:01:28.259> pg-13<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:31.070> yes<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.310> looks<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.610> every

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
been pg-13 and yes it looks like every

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
been pg-13 and yes it looks like every
single<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> movies<00:01:33.750> has<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.140> pg-13

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
single one of the movies has been pg-13

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
single one of the movies has been pg-13
so<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.360> will

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
so I really think that they will

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.100 
so I really think that they will
continue<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.549> have

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
continue this and that they will have

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
continue this and that they will have
addressed<00:01:40.110> drastic<00:01:40.890> world<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.340> pg-13<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.210> well

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
addressed drastic world be pg-13 as well

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.770 
addressed drastic world be pg-13 as well
now<00:01:42.930> could<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> work<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.890> r-rated<00:01:44.399> film

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
now could it work as an r-rated film

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
now could it work as an r-rated film
definitely<00:01:45.780> i'd<00:01:46.020> love<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
definitely i'd love to see all of the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.050 
definitely i'd love to see all of the
dinosaur<00:01:48.149> gore<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> action<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.590> its<00:01:50.220> entirety

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
dinosaur gore and action in its entirety

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.510

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
but you have to think it's aimed a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
but you have to think it's aimed a
little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.030> towards<00:01:54.329> kids<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> parents

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
little bit more towards kids and parents

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
each movie and they've all still managed

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.920 
each movie and they've all still managed
to<00:02:32.700> stay<00:02:33.240> pg-13<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:35.150> 99%<00:02:36.150> sure<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.810> will

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to stay pg-13 so 99% sure that it will

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.860 
to stay pg-13 so 99% sure that it will
be<00:02:36.960> pg-13<00:02:37.910> pg's<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.300> bit<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.570> likely

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
be pg-13 pg's a little bit more likely

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.560 
be pg-13 pg's a little bit more likely
but<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.010> definitely<00:02:41.640> not<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> be

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
but it's definitely not going to be

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.560 
but it's definitely not going to be
rated<00:02:42.990> R<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.310> even<00:02:44.550> less<00:02:44.940> likely<00:02:44.970> that

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
rated R and it's even less likely that

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.200 
rated R and it's even less likely that
it<00:02:45.720> will<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.870> rated<00:02:46.350> G<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.460> anyway<00:02:47.820> leave<00:02:48.030> your
