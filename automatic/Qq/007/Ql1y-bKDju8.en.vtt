00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:15.530
 hello business by yes today review on 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 hot melt glue 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:25.970
 not a word 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:30.269
 loved ones who can read as 5203 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:39.140
 indulged in a shop with LEDs 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:39.140
 together with the matrices funny as embers tube 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:54.940
 with such pipka dries enough 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:02.500
 quickly and opened 2 2 samples 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 dry small quickly when dry 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.799
 form such here hands quickly hours 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.250
 four houses get up and and if the day 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.420
 hardens completely 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.600
 turns it all just white 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.200
 Silicone in the end maybe there are some 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.819
 supplements are very soft parts here already 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 there is no week and the team is very soft 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:35.080
 just like white rubber you don't know the words 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.080
 it will heat conducting there is another glue 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 bought at fasttek store you so 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.340
 there he is actually hot melt glue 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.149
 look so here it is after setting 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:53.060
 Much stronger is not like 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.670
 almost all silicone to stone 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.330
 turns of course vintage did not sit down 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.410
 solid on harder here is an image and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.840
 try to break the break that is, I 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.250
 Now I will twist here 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.140
 propeller twist that way thermo-glue 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.680
 there is also a channel test 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:21.790
 see cool hop 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.329
 here she broke by the way another 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.269
 glue from the east is much better system 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:35.700
 protect and even here not dried up in the middle 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:39.370
 interesting movies another glue from the east 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.769
 much better kept on twisting then 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.609
 is there a piece of iron bent if 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.659
 chased not really smell some 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.659
 medical bullshit 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:55.599
 these spots 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:03:00.450
 of course not so turned out yourself 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:04.870
 general 1 brothers with not long resist 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.510
 try maybe lucky better for me so 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.579
 this is ordinary white silicone can there that 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.889
 that is, the whale is interspersed with thermal grease 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.680
 I know but I will glue powerful LEDs 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.620
 on another glue from the east watch it even 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 they 'll bring them I 'll go now let's 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.849
 until we break the second sample 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.849
 try also to twist 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.609
 such a record and a half and a half 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:41.579
 stains from peeling off even faster because 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.579
 that no dick stuck 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:55.250
 i.e. possible thermal conductivity 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:58.730
 has a good maybe well dries 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.980
 he see for a very long time that is he 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.049
 strayed openers boards want weeks 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.890
 lay down 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:12.200
 it dries very long and keeps very 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:19.630
 weakly the LEDs I do not glue it 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.630
 will these other bread
