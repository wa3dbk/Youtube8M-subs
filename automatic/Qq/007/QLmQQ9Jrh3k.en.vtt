00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
okay I picked up some 12-gauge shotgun

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.620 
okay I picked up some 12-gauge shotgun
flares<00:00:21.550> they<00:00:22.180> are<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:23.880> 12-gauge<00:00:24.880> shotgun<00:00:24.910> shell

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
flares they are a 12-gauge shotgun shell

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.929 
flares they are a 12-gauge shotgun shell
so<00:00:26.560> standard<00:00:27.039> shotgun<00:00:27.250> shell<00:00:27.579> but<00:00:27.699> it's<00:00:27.820> got<00:00:27.910> a

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
so standard shotgun shell but it's got a

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.240 
so standard shotgun shell but it's got a
flare<00:00:28.300> inside<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.050> when<00:00:29.230> pull<00:00:30.130> the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
flare inside of it so when pull the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.240 
flare inside of it so when pull the
trigger<00:00:30.489> off<00:00:31.149> it<00:00:31.449> goes<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.930> it's<00:00:32.920> kind<00:00:33.129> of<00:00:33.160> a

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
trigger off it goes and it's kind of a

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.130 
trigger off it goes and it's kind of a
fun<00:00:33.430> thing<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:33.610> do<00:00:33.820> just<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.480> compare<00:00:34.900> it<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.019> a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
fun thing to do just to compare it to a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.040 
fun thing to do just to compare it to a
regular<00:00:35.699> that's<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.820> regular<00:00:37.180> shotgun<00:00:37.660> shell

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
regular that's a regular shotgun shell

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.009 
regular that's a regular shotgun shell
there's<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.440> some<00:00:38.559> birdshot<00:00:38.980> but<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.989> a

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
there's just some birdshot but it's a

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.360 
there's just some birdshot but it's a
two<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.230> three<00:00:41.409> quarter<00:00:41.589> inch<00:00:41.800> shell<00:00:42.010> so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
two and three quarter inch shell so

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.770 
two and three quarter inch shell so
these<00:00:42.519> are<00:00:42.670> about<00:00:42.790> maybe<00:00:43.089> a<00:00:43.180> two<00:00:43.390> inch<00:00:43.570> shell

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
these are about maybe a two inch shell

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.799 
these are about maybe a two inch shell
or<00:00:43.870> whatnot<00:00:44.019> but<00:00:44.909> no<00:00:45.909> fire<00:00:46.150> off<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.360> couple<00:00:46.600> see

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
or whatnot but no fire off a couple see

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.170 
or whatnot but no fire off a couple see
what<00:00:46.930> they<00:00:46.989> do<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.670> fire<00:00:48.670> them<00:00:48.820> into<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.059> lake

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
what they do and fire them into the lake

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.310 
what they do and fire them into the lake
there<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.570> don't<00:00:49.690> burn<00:00:49.960> down<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.289> forest

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
there so I don't burn down the forest

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.889 
there so I don't burn down the forest
when<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.739> do<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.730> sit<00:00:52.390> tight<00:00:52.420> here<00:00:52.660> let's<00:00:52.780> watch

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
when I do so sit tight here let's watch

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:27.040 
when I do so sit tight here let's watch
this<00:00:55.800> load<00:00:56.800> in<00:00:56.980> like<00:00:57.129> regular<00:00:57.550> shells

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:54.380 

you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.890 

not<00:01:55.390> very<00:01:55.600> loud<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.940> can<00:01:57.940> see<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> expended

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
not very loud you can see the expended

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.120 
not very loud you can see the expended
shells<00:01:59.140> there<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:01.150> kind<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.360> cool<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:06.040> to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
shells there it's kind of cool I got to

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.469 
shells there it's kind of cool I got to
try<00:02:06.310> some<00:02:06.580> through<00:02:06.790> my<00:02:06.940> eight<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> half

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
try some through my eight and a half

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:41.809 
try some through my eight and a half
inch<00:02:07.870> barrel<00:02:08.800> grizzly<00:02:09.340> here<00:02:17.220> German<00:02:18.220> Frank

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.960 

a<00:02:42.319> lot<00:02:43.319> further<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.950> shorter<00:02:44.340> barrel<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.790> guess

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
a lot further the shorter barrel I guess

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
a lot further the shorter barrel I guess
with<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.269> long<00:02:45.450> 18<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.440> half<00:02:46.590> inch<00:02:46.830> barrel

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
with the long 18 and a half inch barrel

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.780 
with the long 18 and a half inch barrel
on<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.459> 870<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.129> don't<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.640> up

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
on my 870 the just I don't know use up

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280 
on my 870 the just I don't know use up
energy<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.299> barrel<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:51.810> goes<00:02:52.049> far

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
energy in the barrel and this goes far

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:29.470 
energy in the barrel and this goes far
so<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:53.220> more<00:02:53.430> here

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:41.180 

you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.250 

you
