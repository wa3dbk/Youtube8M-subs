what I did and to let it dry next this

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.130 
what I did and to let it dry next this
is<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.440> mold<00:02:37.730> okay<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> layer<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> latex<00:02:39.840> on

the back of your iPod make sure the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.850 
the back of your iPod make sure the
latex<00:02:41.870> has<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:43.049> been<00:02:43.200> dry<00:02:43.379> for<00:02:43.410> too<00:02:43.709> long

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
latex has not been dry for too long

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.229 
latex has not been dry for too long
because<00:02:44.160> otherwise<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.790> won't<00:02:44.940> stick

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
because otherwise it won't stick

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.119 
because otherwise it won't stick
together<00:02:45.510> cut<00:02:46.379> edges<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.129> your<00:02:47.879> latex<00:02:48.209> and

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
together cut edges on your latex and

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.130 
together cut edges on your latex and
apply<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.160> thin<00:02:50.459> layers<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.879> latex<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.989> both

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
apply a thin layers of latex to both

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.550 
apply a thin layers of latex to both
sides<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.620> stick<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.040> down<00:02:54.349> they<00:02:55.349> should

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
sides and stick it down they should

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080 
sides and stick it down they should
stick<00:02:55.799> down<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.940> some

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
stick down but if they don't get some

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.210 
stick down but if they don't get some
elastic<00:02:57.480> bands<00:02:58.370> and<00:03:00.109> stick<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:02.069> hold

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
elastic bands and stick it and to hold

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.150 
elastic bands and stick it and to hold
it<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.489> place<00:03:02.640> whilst<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.209> dry<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.920> first

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
it in place whilst it's dry the first

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.490 
it in place whilst it's dry the first
layer<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.120> latex<00:03:06.510> sticks<00:03:07.200> down

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
layer is so that this latex sticks down

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.640 
layer is so that this latex sticks down
properly<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:09.049> do<00:03:10.049> not<00:03:10.200> worry<00:03:10.349> about<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
properly to it do not worry about the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
properly to it do not worry about the
edges<00:03:10.980> yet<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.459> will<00:03:11.489> work<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.940> that

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
edges yet we will work on that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
edges yet we will work on that
afterwards<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:15.859> thought<00:03:16.859> it'd<00:03:16.919> be<00:03:16.950> quite

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
afterwards I thought it'd be quite

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.410 
afterwards I thought it'd be quite
ironic<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> use<00:03:17.880> TARDIS<00:03:18.299> first<00:03:18.599> and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.770 

okay<00:03:24.420> now<00:03:24.690> gently<00:03:25.230> peel<00:03:25.890> off<00:03:26.099> your<00:03:26.370> dry<00:03:27.120> latex

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
okay now gently peel off your dry latex

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.070 
okay now gently peel off your dry latex
case<00:03:28.080> from<00:03:28.349> your<00:03:28.470> iPod<00:03:29.840> gently<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.459> get<00:03:32.459> some

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
case from your iPod gently and get some

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.420 
case from your iPod gently and get some
Sharpie<00:03:34.080> preferably<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> light<00:03:34.769> color<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.280> that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Sharpie preferably a light color so that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.530 
Sharpie preferably a light color so that
it<00:03:35.549> doesn't<00:03:35.700> show<00:03:35.909> through<00:03:36.090> when<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.299> paint

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
it doesn't show through when you paint

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.960 
it doesn't show through when you paint
and<00:03:36.980> paint<00:03:37.980> around<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.280> edges<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.819> want

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970
