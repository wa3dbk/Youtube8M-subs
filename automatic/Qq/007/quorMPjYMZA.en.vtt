yes<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.299> is<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:07.570> drivatar<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.170> and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
yes this is what drivatar is and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.870 
yes this is what drivatar is and
actually<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:08.920> really<00:01:09.220> struggled<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.670> explain

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
actually I really struggled to explain

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.760 
actually I really struggled to explain
it<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.180> people<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> very<00:01:11.170> new<00:01:11.470> way<00:01:11.740> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
it to people it is a very new way of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.310 
it to people it is a very new way of
thinking<00:01:11.920> about<00:01:12.280> AI<00:01:12.610> its<00:01:13.360> cloud-based<00:01:13.720> so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
thinking about AI its cloud-based so

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320 
thinking about AI its cloud-based so
every<00:01:14.710> time<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.950> race<00:01:15.250> we<00:01:15.460> upload<00:01:15.909> telemetry

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
every time you race we upload telemetry

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.390 
every time you race we upload telemetry
about<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> decisions<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.830> made<00:01:18.010> where<00:01:18.369> you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
about the decisions you made where you

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.090 
about the decisions you made where you
were<00:01:19.020> everything<00:01:20.020> about<00:01:20.200> how<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.470> race<00:01:20.830> and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
were everything about how you race and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.070 
were everything about how you race and

just<00:01:25.119> thinks<00:01:25.450> about<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.810> crunches<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.560> and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
just thinks about it crunches on it and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.219 
just thinks about it crunches on it and
