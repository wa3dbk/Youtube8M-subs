environment and immigration I'd like to

environment and immigration I'd like to
know<00:00:11.830> as<00:00:12.070> you<00:00:12.219> look<00:00:12.250> long-term<00:00:13.059> at<00:00:13.839> that<00:00:14.080> trend

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
know as you look long-term at that trend

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.590 
know as you look long-term at that trend
as<00:00:14.710> someone<00:00:15.580> who's<00:00:15.700> been<00:00:15.849> a<00:00:15.879> constitutional

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
as someone who's been a constitutional

as someone who's been a constitutional
scholar<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.250> think<00:00:18.609> there<00:00:18.820> is<00:00:18.970> something

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
scholar if you think there is something

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540 
scholar if you think there is something
about<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:20.019> rules<00:00:20.260> of<00:00:20.560> our<00:00:20.650> political<00:00:20.920> system

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
about the rules of our political system

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.070 
about the rules of our political system
that<00:00:22.060> ought<00:00:22.269> to<00:00:22.449> change<00:00:22.660> over<00:00:23.050> time<00:00:23.260> I<00:00:25.080> think

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
that ought to change over time I think

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.910 
that ought to change over time I think
that<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:29.170> are<00:00:29.670> real<00:00:30.670> problems<00:00:31.029> with<00:00:31.860> how<00:00:32.860> we

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
that there are real problems with how we

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.130 
that there are real problems with how we
are<00:00:33.930> electing<00:00:34.930> our<00:00:35.050> representatives<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:37.140> think

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
are electing our representatives I think

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.350 
are electing our representatives I think
political<00:00:38.530> gerrymandering<00:00:39.250> has<00:00:39.640> resulted<00:00:40.060> in

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
political gerrymandering has resulted in

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.760 
political gerrymandering has resulted in
a<00:00:40.480> situation<00:00:41.020> in<00:00:41.140> which<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:44.290> 80<00:00:44.560> percent

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
a situation in which with 80 percent

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.120 
a situation in which with 80 percent
democratic<00:00:45.520> districts<00:00:45.970> or<00:00:46.180> 80<00:00:46.390> percent

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
democratic districts or 80 percent

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.480 
democratic districts or 80 percent
Republican<00:00:48.130> districts<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.090> no<00:00:49.420> competition

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
Republican districts and no competition

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.070 
Republican districts and no competition
that<00:00:51.490> that<00:00:51.670> leads<00:00:52.060> to<00:00:52.330> more<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:52.930> more

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
that that leads to more and more

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.020 
that that leads to more and more
polarization<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.070> Congress<00:00:54.490> and<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.730> gets

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
polarization in Congress and it gets

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.210 
polarization in Congress and it gets
harder<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.420> harder<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.750> get<00:00:55.870> things<00:00:56.110> done<00:00:56.320> I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
harder and harder to get things done I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.560 
harder and harder to get things done I
think<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:59.170> Senate<00:00:59.560> filibuster<00:01:00.570> process

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
think that the Senate filibuster process

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.480 
think that the Senate filibuster process
and<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:03.310> 60-vote<00:01:04.019> requirement<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:06.280> break<00:01:06.460> a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
and the 60-vote requirement to break a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.330 
and the 60-vote requirement to break a
filibuster<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.720> making<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.530> harder<00:01:09.310> and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
filibuster is making it harder and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.970 
filibuster is making it harder and
harder<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.850> govern<00:01:10.000> at<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.900> time<00:01:11.260> where<00:01:11.770> there's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
harder to govern at a time where there's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
harder to govern at a time where there's
polarization<00:01:12.760> I<00:01:13.230> think<00:01:14.230> the<00:01:16.110> influence<00:01:17.110> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
polarization I think the influence of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320 
polarization I think the influence of
super<00:01:19.000> PACs<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.480> the<00:01:20.350> ability<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.330> handful

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
super PACs and the ability of a handful

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.400 
super PACs and the ability of a handful
of<00:01:22.390> billionaires<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:23.080> dictate<00:01:23.790> who<00:01:25.410> can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
of billionaires to dictate who can

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.710 
of billionaires to dictate who can
compete<00:01:26.800> or<00:01:27.040> not<00:01:27.250> compete<00:01:27.670> for<00:01:27.850> example<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.600> a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
compete or not compete for example in a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.860 
compete or not compete for example in a
Republican<00:01:29.260> primary<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.300> debate<00:01:31.600> coming

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
Republican primary with a debate coming

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.740 
Republican primary with a debate coming
up<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:34.270> know<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.860> problem<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.880> so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
up that you know that's a problem so so

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.190 
up that you know that's a problem so so
I<00:01:38.170> think<00:01:38.530> there<00:01:38.890> are<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.980> whole<00:01:39.130> range<00:01:39.159> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
I think there are a whole range of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.640 
I think there are a whole range of
systems<00:01:41.200> problems<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:42.730> we<00:01:42.850> have<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.180> resolve

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
systems problems that we have to resolve

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.450 
systems problems that we have to resolve
but<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.800> know<00:01:45.390> having<00:01:46.390> said<00:01:46.630> all<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:47.460> tend

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
but you know having said all that I tend

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.469 
but you know having said all that I tend
to<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:51.090> still<00:01:52.090> pretty<00:01:52.360> optimistic<00:01:52.540> about<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
to be still pretty optimistic about the

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.280 
to be still pretty optimistic about the
future<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:57.100> American<00:01:58.260> political<00:01:59.260> process

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
future of the American political process

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.100 
future of the American political process
in<00:01:59.770> our<00:01:59.860> democracy
