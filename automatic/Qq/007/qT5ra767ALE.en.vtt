00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.920
 Hello everyone 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.360
 Welcome to "Weather Cold Knowledge" 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.680
 Mid-Autumn Festival has just passed 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.400
 I don't know if you have a special trip to the moon. 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 Some people say that the moonlight of the past few months 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.960
 Extra large and special round 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.960
 Is "super moon" 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.920
 Is it really not true? 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.760
 In fact, the so-called "super moon" means 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.160
 July 12 this year 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 The full moon of the three times on August 11 and September 9. 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.680
 The special place is the number of full moons 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.880
 Are happening when the moon is running to the nearest earth. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.120
 The moon looks bigger and lighter in theory. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.640
 As for why this happens? 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.560
 We must first understand that the moon will revolve around the earth. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080
 Its trajectory is round 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.640
 The distance from the Earth is different every day. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.960
 In every month 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.200
 The moon passes through two endpoints on the trajectory 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.280
 The farthest from the earth 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.080
 Apogee 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 And closest to that point 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.920
 Perigee 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.840
 If the full moon occurs in apogee 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.640
 The moon we see will look smaller 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 On the contrary, if it is in a perigee 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.560
 The moon we see will look bigger and lighter. 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.960
 According to NASA 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.800
 In June of last year, 2013 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.400
 A perigee full moon occurred 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.160
 The moonlight at that time compared to the full moon that appeared in other months. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.800
 14% bigger 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.640
 Shining thirty percent 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 Why are there two kinds of full moons? 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.680
 We have to consider the factors of the sun 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.480
 Moon and Earth two celestial bodies 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.800
 Will revolve around the sun at the same time 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 And the full moon will appear when the three become in line. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480
 Just like the animation shows 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.800
 When the earth goes to position (1) 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.600
 The sun shines from the left side of the screen to the right side to the moon. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.400
 The full moon is happening near the apogee 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.120
 About half a year later 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 When the earth runs to position (2) 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 The sun will shine from the right to the left to the moon 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.200
 The full moon is happening near the perigee 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 The moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival this year has not reached the full moon. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.600
 Because the full moon time 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 Appeared after the sunrise on the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 This full moon and July 12 are somewhat similar 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.840
 Two times, two or three hours after leaving the perigee 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.160
 In contrast 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.200
 The full moon on the evening of August 10 to the early morning of the 11th 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 Time of occurrence and time of perigee 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.280
 Less than an hour difference 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.400
 Is the closest of the three times 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.400
 Plus the sky 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.240
 Many citizens and photographers 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.600
 Can capture the bright moonlight that night 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.280
 Whether it is at that full moon or not 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.080
 The sky does not have a ruler in the actual environment. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.160
 Not even two moons at the same time 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.800
 Flat row for everyone to compare 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.360
 So by the naked eye 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240
 Even with lens assist 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000
 Not easy to tell 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.360
 Different full moon sizes and light darkness 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 Weather factor 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.520
 If there is a thin cloud or haze at night 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.240
 The brightness of the moon is even greater 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400
 In addition to subjective factors, everyone’s illusion of a full moon in a perigee 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.240
 It’s very likely that when the moon just rises to the horizon 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.360
 If there is object comparison in the foreground 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.480
 Everyone will think that the moon is very big. 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.520
 In fact, whether the moon is super or not is too important. 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.200
 By enjoying the super beautiful moon 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.400
 Make everyone interested in astronomy 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.600
 Promote relevant knowledge together 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.120
 Isn't it more complete than the full moon?
