00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.740 
there anymore so I'm going to use some
double-sided<00:01:31.590> tape

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.340 

dick<00:01:36.750> cut<00:01:37.229> off<00:01:37.259> ski<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> we'll<00:01:39.719> put<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> right

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
dick cut off ski and we'll put it right

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:50.440 
dick cut off ski and we'll put it right
along<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.950> end<00:01:41.570> it'll<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.780> easier<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> make<00:01:48.799> ok

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
along the end it'll be easier to make ok

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.710

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
tiny little squares I'll cut off one and
then<00:02:04.770> I'll<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:04.920> stack<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.490> top<00:02:05.549> i'm<00:02:06.479> going

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
then I'll just stack it on top i'm going

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:19.150 
then I'll just stack it on top i'm going
to<00:02:06.840> use<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.380> squares<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.450> works<00:02:09.450> best<00:02:10.489> one

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:34.480 

stack<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.489> top<00:02:20.550> again<00:02:26.180> last<00:02:27.180> one

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490
