story

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.530 
story
and<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:35.370> gain<00:02:35.580> two<00:02:35.850> stories<00:02:36.270> for<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.470 
and so really gain two stories for the
price<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> guess<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.880> would<00:02:39.390> have

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
price of one I guess but I would have

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.700 
price of one I guess but I would have
actually<00:02:39.780> preferred<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.320> seen<00:02:40.470> more

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
actually preferred to have seen more

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.410 
actually preferred to have seen more
clone<00:02:41.010> action<00:02:41.460> but<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> go

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
clone action but there you go

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750 
clone action but there you go

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
new weapons is that the symptom made

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.310 
new weapons is that the symptom made
from<00:03:39.930> quite<00:03:40.170> flimsy<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:41.070> real<00:03:41.340> bury<00:03:41.520> plastic

from quite flimsy a real bury plastic
which<00:03:43.320> isn't<00:03:44.100> very<00:03:44.250> stable<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.410> again<00:03:46.410> once

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
which isn't very stable but again once

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.800 
which isn't very stable but again once
you're<00:03:47.340> gonna<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.580> playing<00:03:47.790> about<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.570> these

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
you're gonna be playing about with these

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.240 
you're gonna be playing about with these
figures<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.290> doesn't<00:03:49.530> really<00:03:49.620> matter<00:03:49.890> because

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
figures it doesn't really matter because
