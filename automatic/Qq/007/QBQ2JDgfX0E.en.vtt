00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:52.830 

ASF<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:41.880> around<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:46.020> let's<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.830> my<00:01:47.040> name<00:01:48.980> is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.789 

and<00:01:53.840> there<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:54.259> go<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:58.280> they<00:01:58.430> have<00:01:58.549> a

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
and there you go and if they have a

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.929 
and there you go and if they have a
another<00:02:02.110> like<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> mask<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.189> head<00:02:04.399> it

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
another like a mask on with the head it

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.130

don't<00:02:05.360> give<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> mask<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:07.270> let's<00:02:08.270> do<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
don't give the mask so let's do the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.930 
don't give the mask so let's do the
owner<00:02:09.789> have<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.000> server<00:02:11.360> i<00:02:11.510> play<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.989> frost

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
owner have the server i play on frost

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.860 

okay<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:24.910> some<00:02:25.060> reason<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.420> doesn't<00:02:25.660> pick<00:02:25.780> up

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
