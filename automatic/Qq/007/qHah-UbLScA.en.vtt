00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hey guys Tim here going to take a first

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.759 
hey guys Tim here going to take a first
look<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.980> primo<00:00:11.490> chill<00:00:12.410> primo<00:00:13.410> flex

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
look at this primo chill primo flex

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.490 
look at this primo chill primo flex
advanced<00:00:14.429> LTR<00:00:15.500> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.820> ten<00:00:17.820> feet<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.500> three

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
advanced LTR this is ten feet or three

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
advanced LTR this is ten feet or three
meters<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.670> may<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:20.970> may<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.510> enough

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
meters which may or may not be enough

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 
meters which may or may not be enough
for<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:21.990> case<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.500> guess<00:00:22.680> we'll<00:00:22.859> find<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.250> it's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
for my case I guess we'll find out it's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.509 
for my case I guess we'll find out it's
half<00:00:24.539> inch<00:00:24.840> inner<00:00:25.470> diameter<00:00:25.980> three-quarter

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
half inch inner diameter three-quarter

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.990 
half inch inner diameter three-quarter
inch<00:00:26.670> external<00:00:27.269> diameter<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:28.230> outer<00:00:28.410> diameter

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
inch external diameter or outer diameter

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
inch external diameter or outer diameter
it<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.150> comes<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.779> 716<00:00:31.710> internal

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it also comes in 716 internal

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.990 
it also comes in 716 internal
five-eighths<00:00:33.059> outer<00:00:34.610> three-eighths<00:00:35.610> inner

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
five-eighths outer three-eighths inner

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.770 
five-eighths outer three-eighths inner
five-eighths<00:00:36.860> outer<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.780> three-eighths

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
five-eighths outer and three-eighths

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
five-eighths outer and three-eighths
inner<00:00:40.050> one-half<00:00:40.950> outer<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:44.129> my

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
inner one-half outer so this is for my

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.770 
inner one-half outer so this is for my
water<00:00:44.520> cooling<00:00:44.910> build<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.420> coming<00:00:45.780> up

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.360 

basically<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.649> wanted<00:00:53.039> something

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
basically just you know wanted something

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.569 
basically just you know wanted something
nice<00:00:53.520> crisp<00:00:53.969> clean<00:00:54.329> white<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.370> come

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
nice crisp clean white this does come

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.920 
nice crisp clean white this does come
with<00:00:56.730> sysprep<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> use

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
with sysprep I'm actually going to use

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
with sysprep I'm actually going to use
their<00:01:00.930> cooling<00:01:01.559> fluid<00:01:02.070> however<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:02.699> also

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
their cooling fluid however which also

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.289 
their cooling fluid however which also
has<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> coolant<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
has the coolant in there and then you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
has the coolant in there and then you
know<00:01:06.420> whoo<00:01:07.430> fancy<00:01:08.430> unboxing<00:01:09.060> huh<00:01:09.150> guys<00:01:09.680> it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
know whoo fancy unboxing huh guys it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.719 
know whoo fancy unboxing huh guys it's
some<00:01:11.130> tubing<00:01:12.860> however<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.549> cool

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
some tubing however it's a really cool

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
some tubing however it's a really cool
tubing<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.979> extremely<00:01:18.770> dense<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
tubing so it's extremely dense as you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.770 
tubing so it's extremely dense as you
can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:24.840> thick<00:01:25.619> walled<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.479> kind

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
can see it's very thick walled it's kind

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710 
can see it's very thick walled it's kind
of<00:01:27.900> hard<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> tell<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.420> my

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of hard to tell you know I have my

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.069 
of hard to tell you know I have my
camera<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.259> 5k<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> i<00:01:33.420> am<00:01:33.869> under

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
camera on 5k which you know i am under

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.350 
camera on 5k which you know i am under
5k<00:01:34.439> lights<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.549> make<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:35.759> look<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
5k lights but it does make things look a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.350 
5k lights but it does make things look a
little<00:01:36.600> bluish<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.579> very<00:01:39.799> um<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
little bluish but this is very um I

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
little bluish but this is very um I
guess<00:01:42.360> elegant<00:01:43.110> white<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:44.040> clean

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
guess elegant white it's very clean

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.590 
guess elegant white it's very clean
white<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> mean<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> looks<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.600> nice<00:01:47.600> it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
white I mean it looks very nice it's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
white I mean it looks very nice it's
very<00:01:48.840> resistant<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> kinking<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> will

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
very resistant to kinking it will

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.420 
very resistant to kinking it will
actually<00:01:50.610> flatten<00:01:51.360> before<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> kinks<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
actually flatten before it kinks so you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
actually flatten before it kinks so you
can<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.210> bends<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
can get some really good bends out of it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.920 
can get some really good bends out of it
without<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.500> too<00:01:55.770> far<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.570> I'd<00:01:57.689> never

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
without going too far you know I'd never

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.340 
without going too far you know I'd never
say<00:01:58.200> bend<00:01:58.700> tubing<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.540> over<00:02:00.930> 90<00:02:01.259> degrees

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
say bend tubing you know over 90 degrees

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.910 
say bend tubing you know over 90 degrees
or<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.969> 22<00:02:03.899> short<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> diameter<00:02:04.590> if

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
or you know 22 short of a diameter if

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
or you know 22 short of a diameter if
you<00:02:05.520> wind<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> those<00:02:06.119> situations<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you wind up in those situations you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.449 
you wind up in those situations you
should<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.439> relaying<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.220> your

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
should think about relaying out your

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
should think about relaying out your
system<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.739> that's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> go

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
system but you know that's going to go

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.110 
system but you know that's going to go
in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.320 
in
the<00:02:12.480> fractal<00:02:13.080> design<00:02:13.379> case<00:02:13.799> I'm<00:02:14.099> doing<00:02:14.459> which

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the fractal design case I'm doing which

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.089 
the fractal design case I'm doing which
you<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.780> fractals<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.440> white<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.890> black

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
you know fractals are white and black

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.860 
you know fractals are white and black
and<00:02:17.459> my<00:02:18.000> fans<00:02:18.239> are<00:02:18.450> white<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.720> black<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:20.870> my

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
and my fans are white and black and my

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.740 
and my fans are white and black and my
motherboards<00:02:22.349> blue<00:02:22.909> but<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.000> LEDs<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.540> blue

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
motherboards blue but the LEDs are blue

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.670 
motherboards blue but the LEDs are blue
so<00:02:25.739> winner<00:02:26.400> winner<00:02:26.610> chicken<00:02:26.700> dinner<00:02:27.680> should

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
so winner winner chicken dinner should

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920 
so winner winner chicken dinner should
look<00:02:28.799> good<00:02:29.069> my<00:02:29.819> cooling<00:02:30.120> fluids<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.540> actually

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
look good my cooling fluids is actually

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.630 
look good my cooling fluids is actually
blue<00:02:31.110> even<00:02:31.440> though<00:02:31.530> you'll<00:02:31.709> never<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.459> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
blue even though you'll never see it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.690 
blue even though you'll never see it
anymore<00:02:32.940> mmm<00:02:33.690> less<00:02:34.620> i<00:02:34.769> buy<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> new<00:02:35.220> reservoir

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
anymore mmm less i buy a new reservoir

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.410 
anymore mmm less i buy a new reservoir
so<00:02:37.040> not<00:02:38.040> much<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.400> say<00:02:38.519> other<00:02:38.970> than<00:02:39.180> this
