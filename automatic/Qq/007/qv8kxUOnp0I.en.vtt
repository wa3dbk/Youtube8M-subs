00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:14.919
 formerly when a builder starts a work even if 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.419
 to record the foundation's roads 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.039
 I annoyed the neighbors with the noise and was still required to pay for damages 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.039
 caused by the vibrations in neighboring constructions 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
 very high cost 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.330
 the judge refused 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.240
 common system 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 with advanced technology that allows stacking 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.380
 the most economical 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.710
 is the system that highlights alice and continuous monitored 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.700
 is faster because the modern machines with why varies from ten to 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.180
 twenty-two-ton subway can be installed in the yard in only four 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.300
 hours and not precisely electricity 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.000
 is more efficient because each machine can run more than 4 thousand meters 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.040
 stakes per month against only biometric 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 you have a monitored continuous strategy is more secure 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000
 although very south 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.240
 own craft 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 the high quality of equipment of the teams 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 throughout the service 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.860
 drilling and need to be controlled by on-board computer 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.290
 reached the desired depth which can be up to 24 meters with a diameter 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.770
 up to 1 meter and 10 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 is pumped with the predetermined pressure into the interior of the propeller 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.470
 to be continued 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.360
 which injected concrete into the volumes with the correct specifications in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 Statically Retarded and Controlled Speed 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.100
 all properly monitored followed by second with the advantage of operation of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 donations and noise levels and lower than those required by the community 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.820
 European economy 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.299
 if necessary with the concrete still fresh are placed the armors 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.020
 but kaká continuous monitored helix is ​​controlled by the fox system ii 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.469
 the lopes rate 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.289
 all information from each stake is stored on a floppy disk 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.359
 for the processing of a form of 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.239
 where there is a deep 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.769
 the concrete wall 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.689
 the pressure of concrete throughout the state 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.459
 the execution time 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.939
 the actor that is applied 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.949
 penetration rate 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.289
 and speed of traffic rotation 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.429
 you know exactly the final characteristics of the cups 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.119
 the continuous propeller stake monitored even more economically because it has high 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119
 productivity 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.739
 it's more economical 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.689
 we have the few people on the bed 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.689
 only four people are needed for the entire operation 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.629
 most economical per kilo 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.889
 neighbors nor do we give the stakes already 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.419
 the continuous propeller stake 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.869
 and more economical which is smarter than the others 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.419
 in the basic version 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.709
 for the execution of this dog due to the high equipment torque of having 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.549
 twenty-two-ton subway 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.109
 petit perforations in the high resistance ' 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.540
 voice and soft slopes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.999
 with large diameters of great depths 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.329
 see the ge is the fixed on the multiple uses of our modern 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.659
 equipment 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.580
 for being yours 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.110
 has to win
