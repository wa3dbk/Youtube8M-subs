00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.020
 Just like my other works before 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.660
 Everything is done on the computer 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.380
 The advantage of the computer is that it makes my scene scheduling in the frame more convenient. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 Simply put this: on a blank page, 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.660
 Paste the pre-scanned split script 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.820
 Then, what you see on the screen is the split mirror 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.540
 After completing this step, I will remove the conversation and leave only the outline. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.740
 This is for the needs of the next character shaping and picture structure. 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.420
 It is convenient for me to grasp the composition of the image in each split and the position of the character. 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 However, at this time, the characters did not have expressions, and the emotional attitudes were not clear. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.140
 This is the so-called draft, then I can start painting 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.740
 For example, in this split mirror 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:01.940
 The plot is that Professor Bonchoski will say to Paulina that he is old. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.820
 So on composition, I tend to put Professor Bonchoski outside the frame. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:16.220
 And stressed that after he said this, Paulina felt a little sad reaction 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.580
 As for the existence of these simple gray tones, it has been a symbolic message for me. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 Because I paint the human body with white, so when they dance, they become a white shadow. 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 And gray is only used to outline its clothing, daily life, etc. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.020
 As for the strong contrast between black and white, it means they are on the stage. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.820
 In other words, just the color, you can distinguish the scene, the action and the characteristics of each character. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 So it's like code, it's an aid to my narrative 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.300
 Don't forget that this is a narrative picture. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.620
 The purpose of the image is to make the story smoother. 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.100
 As long as we can express the emotions or feelings we want to convey 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 Then you don’t have to worry about the perfection of the details. 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.100
 The reader’s eyes stay on the screen for no more than one second. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 So I focus on character shaping, and there is no complicated and gorgeous background decoration. 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.100
 The techniques I use allow me to draw quickly, and more importantly, the degree of completion is high. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.740
 Otherwise, if I spent more than two years painting the same thing 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.500
 I will get bored when I draw a certain degree, and then the work is difficult to produce. 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.140
 In fact, I often struggle with the skills I use. 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.700
 Such as not rewriting the artwork with a pencil, etc. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 As a result, when I take the strokes, I am at the signing ceremony. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.020
 Every time, I try to open a box of watercolors and say something to myself! 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460
 However, to paint this kind of thing for painting, I always give up very quickly. 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 In narrative art, narrative is the focus 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.980
 The picture plays a supporting role in relation to the narrative. 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.340
 For this, the computer can be said to be very convenient. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 And it is a super good helper for the scene scheduling 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.460
 For me, I think that when I draw comics, I am more like a director than an illustrator.
