00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.390
 strap as recalled a few days ago 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.420
 i percent 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.590
 A homework 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.970
 what was waiting for a 'break' concomitance of theirs 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.949
 l'orÃ©al is going to 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.849
 as 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.359
 the cultural mercedes how to change the color of eyes 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 to univalle 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 if it's for that we need 8 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.239
 and we started 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.460
 the first thing is life 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.240
 start 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 let's open photoshop 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 once it is open another open 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.800
 file open 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 let's talk 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.570
 the image that we are going to change using them eyes 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.530
 the red color that we are going to change 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 and we go exile bleach and pierina yoli 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.230
 a fix 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.750
 panama get clear 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600
 voser that margin 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 we maximize it 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 i 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.980
 we put 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.770
 we go 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.900
 they created out 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 each one coconut 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 for that reason calderÃ³n finished created 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.570
 let's say that another proposal passed as 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.420
 brown 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 rough voice 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.230
 boos 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.700
 to target frossasco animation with him 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 in Mexico 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.420
 the eyes changed color 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.160
 with control is more 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.560
 we were commenting 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.840
 with this 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 once this mentioned as sousa ar-15 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 15 that you long expected while in Chile 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 then we will find ourselves look at the color 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 and we are going to change that green color 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.290
 we have used and clear patent red color but I do not have 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.159
 cook to the diameter 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.449
 ready 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.719
 diameter 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.369
 how do you want to understand that is what you have insinuated and then a little 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.649
 flowers 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.189
 they say percent after the break 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.579
 then let's paint the eye 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.209
 8 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.409
 and so we continue 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.409
 danone 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.310
 we'll see 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 eye everything continues giving 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.790
 by john life 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.139
 flower by luxury 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.089
 giving him 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.089
 crist 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.810
 after we go 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.810
 the normal Copts asked about how they see it 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 names like those of team did not speculate 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.639
 and you will see that the lights have changed seem almost real 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.419
 then 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.499
 how do you see a touch because after excelling 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.969
 we made savings as a player 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.969
 with work he stole 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.549
 d 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 On the other hand also 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.399
 He said yes but on the other 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.189
 not for example together 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.069
 3d 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.639
 square so this proposal to change the eye let's go percent 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.029
 settings 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.029
 everything and saturation 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.149
 piti 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.149
 please with unit 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:11.969
 certainly of both that environment but let's see the programs 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.539
 dresses 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.590
 I like to say semester red stage 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.270
 The famous tea ponemon 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.099
 co control at least 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.099
 will visualize the magic 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.020
 not so 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.570
 then so I will return margin or go to dinner goat 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.909
 remember how 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.909
 and with an image 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.240
 notions for bronze 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 in 2009 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.009
 in the transformation in Seoul in jpg 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.650
 percent 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.240
 and is approached 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.969
 let's ask for justice 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.659
 i 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.779
 the robberies and this was all this efe 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.839
 next to bullfight 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.289
 the process here we are 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.369
 we are going to return to his seat but if something we did not like I hope that 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:27.610
 recover eta 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.490
 few as newly dv 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.350
 i 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.770
 receivers 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.089
 unified and comment 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.789
 the igic theme and I want I love to see if you can leave efe as 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.849
 thank you 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.099
 pipo apparently or eve
