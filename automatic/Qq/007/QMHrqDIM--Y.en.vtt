00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.100 
this - I guess clean my car
this<00:00:20.710> was<00:00:20.890> actually<00:00:21.520> cheaper<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.150> buy<00:00:22.630> than

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
this was actually cheaper to buy than

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.609 
this was actually cheaper to buy than
the<00:00:23.760> other<00:00:24.760> clay<00:00:25.510> bars<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.450> market<00:00:28.480> it<00:00:29.470> was

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
the other clay bars on the market it was

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.989 
the other clay bars on the market it was
about<00:00:29.890> ten<00:00:30.160> dollars<00:00:30.369> for<00:00:32.100> like<00:00:33.100> actually<00:00:33.940> I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:33.999 
about ten dollars for like actually I

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.989 
about ten dollars for like actually I
think<00:00:34.089> it<00:00:34.300> was<00:00:34.329> like<00:00:34.480> 850<00:00:35.230> for<00:00:36.039> 100<00:00:36.489> grams<00:00:36.730> so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
think it was like 850 for 100 grams so

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.869 
think it was like 850 for 100 grams so
that's<00:00:37.179> a<00:00:37.920> few<00:00:38.920> cents<00:00:39.159> cheaper<00:00:39.429> than<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
that's a few cents cheaper than the

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.889 
that's a few cents cheaper than the
other<00:00:40.059> ones<00:00:40.390> but<00:00:42.149> hopefully<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.239> this<00:00:43.690> will
