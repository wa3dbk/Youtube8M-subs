00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.539
 the nervous system is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and millions 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.409
 of cells called me one more 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.949
 together form a network where the electrical impulses circulate 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.800
 that control all the activities of the organism 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.629
 The head contains the most complex areas of the nervous system 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.940
 the nerves related to the brain are the cranial nerves 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 related to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.030
 both organs form the central nervous system that processes coordinates the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 general activity of the organism 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 the spinal cord located along the spine 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.250
 receives and sends impulses to the brain for its coordination 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.930
 If this electrical network does not work properly, alterations occur 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.730
 in the transmission 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.000
 which can translate into uncontrolled movements loss disorientation 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 of memory total or partial immobility tremors and so on 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.340
 a very representative condition is the disease of the skimmer 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 although with the deterioration of some of eurona cerebral a loss is created 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.940
 of several important faculties like memory concentration recognition 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.660
 of faces and so on 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.110
 another very important nerve disorder is multiple sclerosis 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 This condition destroys the layer that covers the nerves and prevents 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.420
 circulation of electrical signals causing muscle contractions and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 devastating effects on the body 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 again 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.630
 nutrition is a key factor 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.759
 the contribution of amino acids antioxidant vitamins and repairers such as 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.830
 vitamin C 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.140
 b 5 b6 of 12 choline and minerals are fundamental in the prevention and treatment 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.009
 myth of these conditions
