00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 yes see saws I'm screwed 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 sawing with scissors 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.700
 costs of its bank less 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.330
 but it always happens a moment when you 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.250
 are a little tired 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.400
 you think of something else but just before 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:41.720
 you say hoo there it's dangerous and slams 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:46.879
 his magnifying glass never what they are full 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.239
 of iron oxide two pieces of metal 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.730
 plane dust we mean the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.620
 dust of the man - they are well 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.559
 wide and I really like to serve 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.449
 I'm pretty happy to have learned this 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:07.670
 a job where my job senna because 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.810
 that because it allows close to do 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.250
 so much stuff I think 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.200
 what when when I was a kid I had full 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.150
 of stuff making ideas but what 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.590
 was not within reach for albums 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.659
 to achieve them to finish them 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.460
 finally to make the violin 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.770
 somewhere it brought me back a little bit 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.150
 childhood and tell me ah that's it 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 now I can tinker with everything 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.570
 I had in mind what in the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.010
 violin workshops we find them quite 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.980
 often it's the tools 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
 japanese so there is here for example 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.110
 who are not six like us 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.370
 that we finally push and do not cut when 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.280
 we push them to cut when we stretch 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.830
 we push the blade under the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.760
 resistance of the store teeth and so one 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.890
 is forced to make blades a lot 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.020
 thicker there are blades that make 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.070
 0.25 mm thick to make 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 hyper end features 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.170
