00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.129
 of the whereabouts of game towers who 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 continues to enjoy his freedom is the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.969
 September 28th when the judge 42 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.620
 criminal of the Bogota circuit orders 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.590

 several victims who dared to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.950
 denounce it 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.220

 for the threats they are receiving 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.870
 for us it is quite worrying already 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.890
 we understand where the threats come from 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.990
 I think that from the beginning they have 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.330
 tried to shut us up without the order of 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.010

 Pasture is a city supremely 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.180
 Catholic and that as a basis for this is that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.710
 there are many churches the victims do 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.690

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.940
 go out and let those who are in the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.610
 process that remain firm 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.250

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.290
 Attorney General to all entities that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.840
