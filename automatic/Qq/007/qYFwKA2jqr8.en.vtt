00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello, welcome to cook with Carmen 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 today our recipe will be mushrooms 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 fillings and the ingredients that are going to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.889
 need are the following 9 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.240
 mushrooms that lend half a kilo 250 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 grams of bacon or bacon 150 grams of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.270
 grated cheese in my case I'll use the one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.190
 onion a clove of garlic a little bit of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.310
 parsley a little salt pepper 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.490
 and oil in my olive case we already have 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.050
 the mushrooms clean and dry and now 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.830
 let's move on to remove the stem 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.830
 can fill it 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.289
 we cut the piece of the final part 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.010
 which is already drier and we go to cut 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.010
 small pieces 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.980
 yes 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.660
 we have already cut your volunteers and we are going 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.220
 to continue with the recipe now 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.590
 we will put a little oil in a 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.760
 pan and I'll put my wta plate to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.469
 mid fire 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.300
 and once the oil is hot 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.629
 we will be putting the mushrooms mouth 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.629
 down 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 and we'll wait for them to be something a bit 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 for this face and meanwhile we are going to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.009
 make the filling so we put a little 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.579
 of oil in another pan we will put it to 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.579
 mid fire 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 Once the oil is hot , 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.380
 we toss the garlic and the onion and we will go 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.830
 moving from time to time until you're 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.690
 the sofrito 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.550
 as we see that the mushrooms are 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.640
 made below so let's give it 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 the return to all and we will put a little 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 of salt 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 and a little pepper 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.990
 and let's let it be more for this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.659
 side also once the mushrooms 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.820
 are made on both sides we turn off and 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.580
 we set it aside and we're going to put the new 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.190
 tray up to oven when the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.149
 onion is a little sofrito we add 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.330
 the stems the bacon and we move it very 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.330
 all right 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.770
 we add a little salt and a little 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.770
 Pepper 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.850
 and we will continue moving it from time to time 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.520
 when until the stems and the bacon 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.230
 They are a bit made once the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.239
 filling is almost said if you want to 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.250
 you can put a little white wine what 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.490
 we will put on a strong fire and we throw the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.920
 wine 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.920
 we move it and wait for it to evaporate 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 once the wine has evaporated 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.190
 we turn off and we throw the parsley and what 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.620
 we move a video 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.390
 and we have ready the padding and now 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.960
 I'm going to put my oven grant to preheat 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 at 240 degrees and we will fill in the 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.620
 mushrooms 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.580
 and once they're all filled we're going 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.030
 to move on to put some cheese for 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.030
 over 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.110
 and we're going to go to gratin our 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.540
 mushrooms in the oven and we're going to 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.220
 leave with heat only above 240 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.950
 degrees 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.900
 once from the tub 2 we went to remove them 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 let's wait for it to cool a little 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.980
 to pass it to a plate here you can see 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.290
 how is it inside 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 and here a presentation suggestion 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.610
 As you can see, it looks great and 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.290
 Now I'm going to pass to try one if it has 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.569
