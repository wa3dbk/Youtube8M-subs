00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150 
felt i think origins was like shorter
than<00:03:34.299> city<00:03:34.600> city<00:03:34.870> was<00:03:35.049> long<00:03:35.320> as<00:03:35.530> I'm<00:03:35.650> all<00:03:35.890> three

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
than city city was long as I'm all three

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.670 
than city city was long as I'm all three
and<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:37.090> think<00:03:37.150> night<00:03:37.570> should<00:03:37.900> be<00:03:38.049> bigger<00:03:38.590> than

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
and I think night should be bigger than

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.080 
and I think night should be bigger than
all<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:38.950> them<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.610> should<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.760> longer

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
all of them I think it should be longer

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.000 
all of them I think it should be longer
and<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.420> think<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.630> should<00:03:40.810> go<00:03:40.900> over<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.350> day<00:03:41.709> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
and I think you should go over a day I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.160 
and I think you should go over a day I
think<00:03:42.640> we<00:03:42.730> should<00:03:42.760> see<00:03:43.150> what<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
think we should see what like the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.130 
think we should see what like the
craters<00:03:44.680> take<00:03:45.100> on<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> daytime<00:03:45.850> view<00:03:46.420> maybe<00:03:46.959> we

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
craters take on a daytime view maybe we

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.289 
craters take on a daytime view maybe we
can<00:03:47.320> play<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:47.709> Damian<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.489> Damian<00:03:48.549> has<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> go

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
can play as Damian and Damian has to go

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.539 
can play as Damian and Damian has to go
hun<00:03:49.570> out<00:03:49.720> somebody<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.380> what<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> was<00:03:51.130> thinking

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
hun out somebody and what I was thinking

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.430

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
thought and of course I know a little

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.529 
thought and of course I know a little
bit<00:05:04.189> off-topic<00:05:04.490> but<00:05:04.699> like<00:05:05.059> i<00:05:05.149> said<00:05:05.179> the

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
bit off-topic but like i said the

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.149 
bit off-topic but like i said the
setting<00:05:05.839> daytime<00:05:06.229> nighttime<00:05:06.469> longer<00:05:07.009> than

today<00:05:07.459> which<00:05:08.149> would<00:05:08.389> be<00:05:08.569> of<00:05:08.779> course<00:05:08.809> a<00:05:09.259> Gotham

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
today which would be of course a Gotham

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.339
