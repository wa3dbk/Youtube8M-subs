00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.200
 hey people i want to continue baking today 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.470
 in the singleplayer minecraft also in 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.029
 Game Mode 0 in survival mode as well 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.500
 in multiplayer on vanilla thing 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.840
 works often but there is 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.400
 Unfortunately does not work 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.630
 unless you would be in the multi method 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.890
 find out as well as packages 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.489
 works 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.150
 the important thing is in game mode 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.949
 00 game mode 0 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.390
 otherwise you could get the athletes 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.980
 yes the bug probably know the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.270
 But most of them I have it like this 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.190
 bit changed so too 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.960
 that means we are going in the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.210
 list we need together 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.100
 can use here on the west then 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.890
 Let's just make that the important one here 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.500
 Now we have two diamonds here 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.210
 the family in it must be two so 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.270
 above for a better overview 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.850
 but do not mind a whole armor 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.369
 every case here two diamonds now that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.810
 important as soon as yours will fail 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.490
 and the cup as that means that here 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.830
 from the first slot time 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.259
 it would not have to do but is so good 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.069
 like I got used to it when you do that 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:25.270
 dnt will flash that eight times 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:27.490
 means it blinks eight times that defines 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.009
 means overpowering in the middle 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.090
 here we push the cup 1 us 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.580
 do not do that with shift or 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.610
 Similar press the button 1 so so 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.410
 1234 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.260
 next to 842 we wait with more luck 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.120
 have worked that way here are two 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.670
 diamonds only one to the people in winter 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.740
 that means you can do this diamond 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.500
 start us all that means if you 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.630
 right now makes a right click 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.580
 an infinite number of people out of this 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.220
 works but only if you the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.430
 servers and singleplayer packages her 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.479
 Maybe you can send me if 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.209
 which also works so 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.930
 let's see if anyone I have this 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.670
 try economy what 400 and you see 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.520
 You can do me the man who can 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.150
 collect and then you have more like 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 a man I say or 2 that goes 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.900
 I can bottle every item as well as xp 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.070
 the eyes then the spencer do then 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.070
 does he think that's going through it? 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.890
 and yes that was really wonderful too
