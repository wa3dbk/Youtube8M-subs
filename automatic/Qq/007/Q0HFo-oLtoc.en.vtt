 of the video there is the explanation of this 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.020
 mathematical game 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.230
 the explanation of the numbers game is 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 very simple if the viewer and think 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.590
 17 17 is found only in this one 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 is this box how do you understand one 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.890
 time the viewer indicated 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 and that is only found in this one 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 box to understand that the viewer has 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.220
 thought since 17 because you have to add the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.570
 first number that looks like that first number 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.380
 the number 16 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.300
 and here the first number is the number one e 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.810
 is located at that 17 see here is written 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.930
 17 here also adding 16 plus one gets 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.170
 17 you must always add the first number 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.720
 where the number appears 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.760
 always think think of the number 33 yes 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.070
 find only here and here so you will have to 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.510
 simply add 2 plus 1 2 plus 1 3 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.070
 if the viewer thinks 64 64 is found 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.080
 only in this box 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.730
 so you will have to say once there 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.110
 says he is only here on her and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.840
 64 if you think 66 by chance is there 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.150
 only in this box and in this one 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.740
 box where skies 2 initial then 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.910
 when the viewer will say that I think 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:35.000
 in this plus these is this then you 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 you will say that 64 plus 2 equals 66 clearly 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.320
 do the calculation mentally and reveal e 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.420
 reveals the sum and then immediately repeats the 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.970
 game is really hard for him 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.400
 viewer able to understand what it is 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.010
 you can cut these with scissors 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.840
 small pieces of paper if you prefer 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 also classify them or put them on 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.560
 of scotch and to make them more resistant 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.140
 and bring this game always with you in the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.510
 wallet this is the explanation of the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.510
