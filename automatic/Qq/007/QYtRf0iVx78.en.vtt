00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 good to all youtube friends 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 welcome back to my channel and here 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 I bring you a trick a secret like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.810
 you want to call it the truth that is very 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 very good highly recommended 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.930
 first of all we have to get the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 turbine you know how to take the mannequin 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.519
 put it on the piece after the vane 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.099
 that you find on the site you have to 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.650
 you are watching and finally the fan 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.239
 and good once you have the turbine 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.429
 ok you put it on the door and you go out 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.369
 strong explained before it reaches the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.640
 site consists of teleportation this is 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.470
 a little transport of going by the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080
 different areas of the map without the 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.900
 need for the bus and without the need 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280
 of crossing sites without light is worth 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.050
 what you have to do is put the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.060
 turbine to the 'u' of any street lamp 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 It's worth any lamppost there is and good 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.150
 here you see like this to take away all 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.500
 the zombies above and you have to go to 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.030
 out of the map where the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.980
 these little bugs that you put on 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.600
 heads you know then in the moment 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 that you see that he comes for us in 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 Quick write the student blade 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.360
 so he does not kill you and when you get to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 the turbine look what happens the bug 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 he goes through a kind of door is worth 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 then you jump up and point you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.790
 you appear a sidewalk 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.740
 the authorship of the map but it is not random 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 Now I will explain how this works 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.220
 teleportation system and well you're going to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.110
 see that here they give me a consumption trophy 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.420
 efficient, so it's good, you know 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 at least try it since you're going to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 get a trophy then good this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 Teleportation means that you jump 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 and you go to another area of ​​the map but it's not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 a police zone is an area where there 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 another lamppost go the noeno lampposts 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.300
 after trying distributed in such a way 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.100
 that you can go to any area of ​​the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.890
 map through the teleportation of the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 lamp post without the need to make bus 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.580
 and without spending money or just with the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.950
 turbine is therefore very important and 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.750
 well here you see several shots if not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 you catch one so you can understand more 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.350
 or less how it is done and good in trujillo 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 at the moment that you see that in said 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 high years since jumping you have to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.020
 put running so that you just get caught 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 at the moment that puts your head and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.520
 you catch it from the turbine and obviously 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.810
 it gives us almost no time to knives and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.300
 saw here my colleagues were already 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.130
 applying totally good flipping here 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.080
 You see that it is leaving me next to the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.730
 lamppost okay I'm going to tell you another 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620
 trick for you to do it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.400
 way more efficient and the way we go 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.620
 plus 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.989
 of all and is that nothing else to leave 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 you have to put the turbine 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.870
 outside and wait for the bug to come in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.329
 the mountain that I said is high that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.920
 you would gain the right off the one, 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.230
 you will see that it stays like in the air 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.610
 is that they are blasting clips from the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.670
 turbine but nothing happens stays in the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.590
 air and absolutely nothing happens that is 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.359
 the bug is going to catch us and you can be 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 traveling through teleportation 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.620
 unlimitedly you see here right in the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.329
 point that I reached I put the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.859
 lethal teleport r1 in salten 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.870
 behind strong turbine and good 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.000
 you will see that many times this happens that 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.920
 Sometimes you put it on and the bug hides and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.450
 alert us of transportation I imagine that 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.730
 will be a game failure because what 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.159
 will fix in the future but good 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.870
 it's the most efficient way to do it and 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.599
 Well, I hope you have served this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.879
 video that you have discovered already this is 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.200
 absolutely all teleportation that 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.489
 you know we have to go to other 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.379
 lampposts to go somewhere else be the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.629
 same in this in a lamp post then the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.310
 teleport you get in and then in the 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.930
 next lamp post if you do again with 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.689
 the teleportation theme is going 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.980
 teleport to a map to another form 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.660
 totally different or maybe to the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.080
 previous is already completely random or 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.090
 you can be in the streetlight 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.950
 6 teleport 2 until you arrive 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.220
 to the place that you want you know that 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.900
 There are streetlights at all stops and in 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.700
 all places on the map even in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.470
 the cornfields well this is going to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.940
 Serve a lot to do the interest 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.440
 they're going to have to catch the bus 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.610
 spend money and so be able to go with the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 pieces from one place to another and good 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.010
 I hope it has been useful to give you the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.350
 thanks to all of you since the video 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.510
 yesterday I am very grateful for the great 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.790
 welcome that this evaluation has had and 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.820
 They cost a lot of time and good many 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.020
 thanks again for that welcome and I'll 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.940
 I'm going to leave next for example 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.220
 you lost and we see you in following 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.080
 videos and see if we can get more 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.160
 little things in the transit mode 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.160
 promises up another 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.170
 the view 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.320
 sometimes 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.670
 do not 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.080
 to
