00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
sometimes you just don't draw Lance it's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.290 
sometimes you just don't draw Lance it's
not<00:01:02.770> like<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.040> over<00:01:03.730> even<00:01:03.760> though<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.090> am

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
not like this is over even though I am

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:37.460 
not like this is over even though I am
obviously<00:01:04.780> in<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:06.580> worse<00:01:06.850> shape<00:01:06.910> now

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.740 

really<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.579> happened<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.970> that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
really that just happened really that

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.450 
really that just happened really that
just<00:01:44.020> happened

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.690 

honestly<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:48.710> think<00:01:48.860> that's<00:01:49.130> actually<00:01:49.280> good

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
honestly I think that's actually good

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.080 
honestly I think that's actually good
for<00:01:49.940> me<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:51.590> depriving<00:01:52.369> me<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.640> an

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
for me I don't think depriving me of an

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.540 
for me I don't think depriving me of an
off-color<00:01:53.720> manner<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.830> going<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.130> be<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.340> good

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
off-color manner is going to be as good

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.580 
off-color manner is going to be as good
as<00:01:55.610> say<00:01:56.090> keeping<00:01:56.540> one<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:56.960> things<00:01:57.260> tap

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
as say keeping one of these things tap

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.560 
as say keeping one of these things tap
down<00:01:57.800> would<00:01:58.010> have<00:01:58.100> been<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:59.210> I'm<00:01:59.270> sure<00:01:59.509> I'm
