know whether you like it or not I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.750 
know whether you like it or not I
personally<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:29.189> they're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
personally do like it is that they're

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.659 
personally do like it is that they're
using<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> bit<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> an<00:00:30.810> on-time<00:00:31.260> delivery<00:00:31.890> model

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
using a bit of an on-time delivery model

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.990 
using a bit of an on-time delivery model
for<00:00:33.300> their<00:00:33.960> silver<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:35.520> place<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.940> order

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
for their silver you place your order

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
for their silver you place your order
and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.690> seems<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.559> they're<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.920> out

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and it seems like then they're going out

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.360 
and it seems like then they're going out
in<00:00:38.309> securing<00:00:38.820> blanks<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.739> as<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.190> they

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
in securing blanks right as so that they

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
in securing blanks right as so that they
don't<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.239> caught<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
don't you know get caught up in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.790 
don't you know get caught up in the
day-to-day<00:00:43.950> price<00:00:44.550> movements<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> silver<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
day-to-day price movements of silver and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
day-to-day price movements of silver and
the<00:00:46.800> reason<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.820> might<00:00:48.059> be

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the reason that that's actually might be

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
the reason that that's actually might be
a<00:00:48.210> good<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.140> they're<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.680> sitting<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
a good thing is they're not sitting on a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
a good thing is they're not sitting on a
ton<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> inventory<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> they're<00:00:52.469> actually<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
ton of inventory so they're actually not

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.700 
ton of inventory so they're actually not
charging<00:00:53.910> big<00:00:54.360> premiums<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> these<00:00:55.230> price

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
charging big premiums on these price

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
charging big premiums on these price
moves<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.420> right<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> places<00:00:57.989> will

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
moves down right a lot of places will

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
moves down right a lot of places will
actually<00:00:58.829> start<00:00:59.010> rate<00:00:59.250> Crete<00:00:59.550> having<00:00:59.879> their

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
actually start rate Crete having their

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
actually start rate Crete having their
premiums<00:01:00.390> creep<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.899> including<00:01:01.379> local<00:01:01.710> coin

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
premiums creep up including local coin

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
premiums creep up including local coin
shops<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
shops and and that's actually not the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.230 
shops and and that's actually not the
case<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> silver<00:01:05.400> bowl<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> silver<00:01:06.000> shield

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
case with a silver bowl of silver shield

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.910 
case with a silver bowl of silver shield
round<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> might<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.380> might<00:01:07.710> i'm

for me to make a purchase it could

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510

risk<00:02:02.130> assets<00:02:02.610> could<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.939> affected<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
risk assets could be affected if the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
risk assets could be affected if the
market<00:02:03.960> holds<00:02:04.259> his<00:02:04.350> breath<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.829> stomps<00:02:05.189> his

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
market holds his breath and stomps his

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.119 
market holds his breath and stomps his
feet<00:02:05.310> waiting<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> resolution<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:07.129> was

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
feet waiting for a resolution I was

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.350 
feet waiting for a resolution I was
going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> tell<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.819> there<00:02:08.970> may<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
going to tell you that there may be a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
going to tell you that there may be a
nice<00:02:09.539> buying<00:02:09.840> opportunity<00:02:10.379> because<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.739> this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
nice buying opportunity because of this

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.640 
nice buying opportunity because of this
but<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.450> said<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.720> seems<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.500> here

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
but like I said it seems like it's here

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
but like I said it seems like it's here
now

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.570 

so<00:02:16.780> silver<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.230> an<00:02:17.350> interesting<00:02:17.890> play<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.460> it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
so silver is an interesting play and it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.400 
so silver is an interesting play and it
always<00:02:18.790> kind<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.210> has<00:02:19.360> been<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.720> me<00:02:19.870> because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
always kind of has been to me because

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.700 
always kind of has been to me because
it's<00:02:21.310> always<00:02:21.760> been<00:02:22.750> considered<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.290> precious

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
it's always been considered a precious

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's always been considered a precious
metal<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.300> its<00:02:25.600> industrial<00:02:25.900> uses<00:02:26.380> have

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
metal but as its industrial uses have

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.120 
metal but as its industrial uses have
been<00:02:26.950> increasing<00:02:27.640> its<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.960> tied<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
been increasing its really tied to the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.550 
been increasing its really tied to the
economy<00:02:30.430> too<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.780> if<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> economy<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.470> doing

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
economy too but if the economy is doing

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.800 
economy too but if the economy is doing
poorly<00:02:32.950> industrial<00:02:33.610> usage<00:02:33.910> goes<00:02:34.120> down<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
poorly industrial usage goes down and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
poorly industrial usage goes down and
the<00:02:35.200> price<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.530> silver<00:02:35.710> will<00:02:35.890> go<00:02:36.040> down<00:02:36.190> but

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the price of silver will go down but

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670 
the price of silver will go down but
we've<00:02:37.210> also<00:02:37.420> always<00:02:37.750> seen<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> safe

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
we've also always seen it as a safe

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.910 
we've also always seen it as a safe
