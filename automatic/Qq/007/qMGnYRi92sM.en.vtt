 measured marks you talk about 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.259
 benefit raw foods meaninglessness 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.570
 alcohol and drug use 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.750
 a healthy lifestyle young people 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.049
 sleep listening carefully 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.679
 also telling about alternative 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:15.889
 providing an example to the rest 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.689
 When traveling, tell me you're babichev 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.419
 in fact, and passed with such 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.409
 some discoveries 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.169
 therefore, I believe that, in principle, people should 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.429
 provide information alcohol 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.679
 drugs it all comes from there 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.690
 degradation is all our consciousness night 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 and just kill gradually so I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.660
 dear and other entertainment will be 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.170
 travel don't know st help people 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 survive something more than posts 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 lost world 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 and the Russians cleared eight horizons 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.180
 no rewards for extracting from 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.530
 alcohol drugs when i just bought 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.670
 May 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.290
 so I consider it my duty to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.350
 composition to the marginal cost of business so 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 how to inform people that it was so 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.640
 in the stop sheet young ideology on beer 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 when such a way of life 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 and who fully promote 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.470
 a certain event of the year completely price-fives 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.650
 at that moment even if it is wise to count 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.860
 rival 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.110
 that's why I am 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.770
 just wanna go with the kids about it then 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.970
 that I have reached myself not to tell others 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.340
 maybe this is how you would help 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.870
 as it is 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.020
 positive 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.000
 helps and travel a lot 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 different countries and continents 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.470
 told what is natural 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.320
 given 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.350
 to give you more legality 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.009
 yes and not very much travel therefore 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.770
 it's hard to say what exactly 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.300
 a failure in place influenced me too 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.790
 remembered in every scene 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.750
 something 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.159
 stood in line 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.490
 affects the inner world is a complete quito 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.700
 Estimates of what is happening of course 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.000
 Tibetan 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 I was most affected by this quite 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.440
 indigenous heritage of Mexico 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.189
 of america 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.539
 yes my favorite country 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.799
 trading on the US exchanges 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.799
 since the first also tajikistan 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.829
 very interesting energy 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.859
 recently visited the report 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.559
 it says very much 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.589
 powerful view almost one of the stages of the level 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.729
 crime therefore 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.539
 and will continue on the journey 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.539
 as always knowing what was 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.059
 present moment i am going to stories 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.329
 people who are treating various 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.529
 diseases using raw foods 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.589
 unprocessed vegetable food 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.199
 Now I can say with confidence 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.219
 that this way you can cure any 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.349
 disease learn about the causes and 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.109
 circumstances 1 we are with her people completely 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.569
 to change the meaning of life in life 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.520
 How do you think 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.940
 if we all became at least Wednesday in Minsk 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.959
 found the best side 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.789
 and change again 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.789
 at least not become cleaner and kinder 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.269
 when a person comes population not 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.609
 may continue the blows drink smoking so 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.329
 further in awareness cleared hugging 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.029
 that this is all picket not gifts from everyone 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:13.999
 withdrawals 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.929
 according to the norms and people discounts 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.009
 having different responding to all 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.369
 animals must choose what for us 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.789
 better therefore I think that lobbyists 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.339
 the song became a state of opportunity 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.529
 our traditional leap occurred 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.149
 rush in the shortest time to make a 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.019
 Particular attributed to stretch 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.820
 tax of course is a lot of good 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.050
 the idea appears more and more sun does not 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.900
 less kp then this is lost critical 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.750
 the masses after which the year something has changed 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.179
 globally side of the best 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.659
 I know what you prefer 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.439
 meditation why do you think 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.399
 discounts are so important for people 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.859
 and the growth dynamics of this I spend sometimes 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.399
 such meditation yes harmonize 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.189
 space reproaches meeting that 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.219
 the grid of the earth anyway carries a positive 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.290
 any actions Rodriguez positive 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.909
 you can understand them today plan 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.229
 what he 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.639
 quantity 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.409
 happy people 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.799
 don't know me no agreement can 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.799
 start growing it certainly pleases 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.810
 we live in the real world where at this 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.889
 moment of april swelling 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.499
 people spend almost all their time on work 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:25.559
 being 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.519
 this reaction will stand 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.499
 build up 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.879
 to reason to believe in this way 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.419
 ohhh how strange the whole system 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.740
 how do you see a way out of this situation 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.120
 person from position for the first time so that 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.529
 could live in perfect shape 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.139
 but again it cannot and must begin 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.359
 felt 5 3 this is the first way 

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.229
 our food 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.670
 as she says 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.509
 let's start gm dat bye park 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.330
 a ounce 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.009
 what we eat 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.749
 that is, we are what we eat more precisely so I 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:00.749
 I think that the very first step is 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.020
 of course start eating right 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.710
 contact details visiting your body 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.169
 right product or it works 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.650
 required by all 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.490
 completely different thoughts appear then 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.930
 degree of difficulty 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.960
 so I think that people are in 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.699
 open access reactor 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.599
 it is pleasant that a lot of people think 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.180
 different historical books and so on 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.960
 so everything is fine but they broke there rest 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.880
 the bodies behaved on price less continues 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.810
 oil to have whatever they are 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.289
 continue truth for suffering 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.000
 animals pollute the environment 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.069
 destroy cloten 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.889
 on this you will not go far we do not know that 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.060
 there is this inside a minister in itself 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.980
 some of them are a specific project 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.490
 There is no change and it is not foreseen yet 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.210
 shot out
