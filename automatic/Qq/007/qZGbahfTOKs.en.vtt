the smooth brushes we generally use a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.180 
the smooth brushes we generally use a
pure<00:00:08.730> squirrel<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.710> much<00:00:10.860> finer

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
pure squirrel here it's a much finer

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.259 
pure squirrel here it's a much finer
bristle<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.809> makes<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> soft<00:00:13.620> stroke

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
bristle and it makes for a soft stroke

you're working the medium through your

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
use for oil painting on canvas and they

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.340 
use for oil painting on canvas and they
are<00:01:01.059> towel<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:04.120> camel<00:01:05.120> things<00:01:05.870> like<00:01:06.080> that

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
are towel on camel things like that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.950 
are towel on camel things like that
they're<00:01:07.070> usually<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.460> pretty<00:01:07.700> smooth<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.540> fine

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
they're usually a pretty smooth and fine

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.900 
they're usually a pretty smooth and fine
brush<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.010> they<00:01:10.160> don't<00:01:10.400> have<00:01:10.700> the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
brush but they don't have the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.609 
brush but they don't have the
consistency<00:01:11.740> which<00:01:12.740> I'll<00:01:12.920> show<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.190> here<00:01:14.619> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
consistency which I'll show you here you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.820 
consistency which I'll show you here you
always<00:01:15.800> squeeze<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.400> excess<00:01:16.790> oil<00:01:17.000> out<00:01:17.440> as<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
always squeeze the excess oil out as the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.359 
always squeeze the excess oil out as the
squirrel<00:01:21.830> does<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:23.570> put<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.900> on<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.619> I'm

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
squirrel does you put it on and I'm

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.550 
squirrel does you put it on and I'm
going<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.610> tip<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.030> up<00:01:28.780> this<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> much<00:01:30.320> more

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
going to tip it up this is a much more

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.999 
going to tip it up this is a much more
even<00:01:32.080> coat<00:01:33.080> where<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.250> with<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.960> synthetic

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
even coat where is with the synthetic

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.350 
even coat where is with the synthetic
it's<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.160> much<00:01:37.340> more<00:01:37.640> scratchy<00:01:38.270> coat<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:40.360> the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
it's a much more scratchy coat and the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.219 
it's a much more scratchy coat and the
reason<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:42.380> use<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.830> synthetic<00:01:43.990> more<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.200> a

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
reason is we use the synthetic more as a

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.910 
reason is we use the synthetic more as a
wipeout<00:01:45.680> tool<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.840> if<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.319> want<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.590> come<00:01:48.740> in

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
wipeout tool so if you want to come in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.350 
wipeout tool so if you want to come in
and<00:01:49.100> lighten<00:01:49.490> something<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.390> clean<00:01:50.690> it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
and lighten something and you clean it

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.029 
and lighten something and you clean it
you<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.539> wipe<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.840> out<00:01:54.020> but<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:54.979> see

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
you can wipe it out but as you can see

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.419 
you can wipe it out but as you can see
the<00:01:55.399> brush<00:01:55.670> strokes<00:01:56.119> much<00:01:56.750> easier<00:01:57.200> here<00:01:57.740> then

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
the brush strokes much easier here then

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.800 
the brush strokes much easier here then
you<00:01:58.580> can<00:01:58.850> hear<00:02:00.039> these<00:02:01.039> are<00:02:01.220> great<00:02:01.610> little<00:02:02.000> wipe

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
you can hear these are great little wipe

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.300 
you can hear these are great little wipe
out<00:02:03.310> brushes<00:02:04.310> because<00:02:05.179> you<00:02:05.300> can<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.840> pure

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
out brushes because you can get a pure

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.140 
out brushes because you can get a pure
clear<00:02:07.310> white<00:02:07.940> white<00:02:08.899> wipe<00:02:09.380> out<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:11.000> use

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
clear white white wipe out so we use

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.930 
clear white white wipe out so we use
both<00:02:11.510> brushes<00:02:11.980> mm<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.250> achieve<00:02:13.550> their<00:02:13.760> looks

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
both brushes mm to achieve their looks

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.300 
both brushes mm to achieve their looks
we<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.569> when<00:02:15.080> you're<00:02:15.230> finished<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:16.280> can

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
we want and when you're finished you can

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.910 
we want and when you're finished you can
clean<00:02:16.730> them<00:02:16.880> out<00:02:17.060> either<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:17.930> oil<00:02:18.140> your

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
clean them out either with your oil your

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.180 
clean them out either with your oil your
medium<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.410> or<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.600> terpenoid<00:02:24.190> again

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
medium like this or the terpenoid again

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.070 
medium like this or the terpenoid again
if<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.819> lot<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.150> pain<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.690> your<00:02:26.810> brush

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
if you have a lot of pain in your brush

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.140 
if you have a lot of pain in your brush
it's<00:02:27.410> easier<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.920> use<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.250> terpenoid<00:02:28.760> because

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's easier to use the terpenoid because

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's easier to use the terpenoid because
you<00:02:29.270> can<00:02:29.420> spare<00:02:29.750> your<00:02:29.900> oil<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.950> medium<00:02:31.340> oils

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
you can spare your oil the medium oils

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.260 
you can spare your oil the medium oils
sometimes<00:02:32.180> gets<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.630> little<00:02:32.810> bit<00:02:32.990> expensive
