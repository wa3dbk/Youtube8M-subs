your blend it in quickly and use an
eyeshadow<00:01:33.750> brush<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.500> mean<00:01:34.710> obviously<00:01:35.130> people

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
eyeshadow brush I mean obviously people

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.390

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
some people use their fingers but with

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.030 
some people use their fingers but with
this<00:01:38.580> because<00:01:39.570> why<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.409> you've<00:01:40.830> got<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this because why what is you've got to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.109 
this because why what is you've got to
use<00:01:41.509> an<00:01:42.509> eyeshadow<00:01:42.720> brush<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
use an eyeshadow brush and I think it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
use an eyeshadow brush and I think it
just<00:01:48.150> needs<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.229> practice<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
just needs a little practice when you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.850 
just needs a little practice when you
put<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.310> cause<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.670> first<00:01:51.680> obviously<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
put it on cause at first obviously you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
put it on cause at first obviously you
don't<00:01:53.070> how<00:01:53.159> long<00:01:53.340> it'll<00:01:53.490> take<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.850> dry<00:01:54.329> when

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
don't how long it'll take to dry when

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.819 
don't how long it'll take to dry when
you're<00:01:54.840> first<00:01:54.960> putting<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:57.110> if<00:01:58.110> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you're first putting it on so if you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.260
