00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
actually get the flag out of our base

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.949 
actually get the flag out of our base
when<00:01:40.729> we're<00:01:40.970> supposedly<00:01:41.240> add<00:01:41.539> three<00:01:41.780> guys

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
when we're supposedly add three guys

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.480 
when we're supposedly add three guys
guarding<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.500> now<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.069> easy<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:43.459> back

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
guarding it now it's easy to go back

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.309 
guarding it now it's easy to go back
watch<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.910> film<00:01:44.300> see<00:01:44.630> what<00:01:44.750> they<00:01:44.869> did<00:01:47.319> the

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
watch the film see what they did the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.070 
watch the film see what they did the
controls<00:01:48.770> basically<00:01:49.580> work<00:01:49.910> exactly<00:01:50.420> how<00:01:51.020> you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
controls basically work exactly how you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.440 
controls basically work exactly how you
would<00:01:51.319> expect<00:01:51.709> them<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.149> simple

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
would expect them to it's so simple

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.540 
would expect them to it's so simple
conceptually<00:01:53.929> but<00:01:54.380> making<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.709> a<00:01:54.770> reality<00:01:54.920> it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
conceptually but making it a reality it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.370 
conceptually but making it a reality it
took<00:01:55.759> years

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 

your<00:01:58.950> first<00:01:59.189> person<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.909> click<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> right

your first person if you click the right

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.200 
your first person if you click the right
stick<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.990> shows<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> person<00:02:03.090> was

stick it shows you what that person was

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
stick it shows you what that person was
looking<00:02:03.600> at<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:03.960> third<00:02:04.229> person<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.310> other

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
looking at from third person the other

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
looking at from third person the other
option<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.030> while<00:02:06.539> you're<00:02:06.720> following

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
option you have while you're following

option you have while you're following
someone<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.439> third<00:02:07.619> person<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:09.390> break<00:02:10.050> out

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
someone in third person is to break out

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.339 
someone in third person is to break out
into<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.769> orbiting<00:02:11.459> camp<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.150> any<00:02:12.630> time<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.140> hit

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
into a orbiting camp so any time you hit

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.440 
into a orbiting camp so any time you hit
the<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.650> stick<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.370> automatically<00:02:15.090> move

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
the right stick you automatically move

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.030 
the right stick you automatically move
out<00:02:15.720> into<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> score<00:02:16.380> winning<00:02:16.530> camera<00:02:16.950> and

out into the score winning camera and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.089 
out into the score winning camera and
you<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.280> zoom<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.569> out<00:02:18.720> I'll<00:02:19.230> say<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.800> did

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.130 
you can zoom in and out I'll say I did
not<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.000> Warthog<00:02:21.360> actually<00:02:21.900> had

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
not know that the Warthog actually had

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.259 
not know that the Warthog actually had
like<00:02:22.440> an<00:02:22.560> internal<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.250> dash<00:02:23.610> lights<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
like an internal like dash lights and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.300 
like an internal like dash lights and
crap<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.769> I'm<00:02:25.890> flying<00:02:26.069> around

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
crap and so then like I'm flying around

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
crap and so then like I'm flying around
I'm<00:02:26.459> like<00:02:26.489> wait<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.810> there's<00:02:27.989> actually

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I'm like wait what like there's actually

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.800 
I'm like wait what like there's actually
like<00:02:28.410> lights<00:02:28.739> in<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.390> there's<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.599> ways<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
like lights in here there's two ways to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.199 
like lights in here there's two ways to
rewind<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.250> either<00:02:32.370> press<00:02:32.640> left<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
rewind you can either press left on the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.839 
rewind you can either press left on the
d-pad<00:02:33.390> which<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.560> shortcut<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.700> can

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
d-pad which is a shortcut or you can

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.650 
d-pad which is a shortcut or you can
bring<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.690> control<00:02:37.230> pad<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.160> light<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
annually every time that someone roll

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.110 
annually every time that someone roll
wines<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.410> save<00:02:46.650> film<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.220> hold<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:47.819> breath

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
wines in the save film I hold my breath

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.780 
wines in the save film I hold my breath
because<00:02:48.599> like<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:50.370> God

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
because like it's like it's like God

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.910 
because like it's like it's like God
reaching<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.569> being<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.930> make<00:02:52.470> magic

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
reaching in and being like make magic

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.410 
reaching in and being like make magic
happen<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.400> then<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.640> magically<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.299> keep

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
happen and then it magically just keep

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
happen and then it magically just keep
working<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.410> complexity<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.069> that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
working like the complexity of that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.589 
working like the complexity of that
system<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.970> insane

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.300 

now<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.659> other<00:03:01.900> cool<00:03:02.260> thing<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.099> ability

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
now the other cool thing is the ability

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.849 
now the other cool thing is the ability
to<00:03:03.640> go<00:03:03.760> into<00:03:03.909> flying<00:03:04.209> camera<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
to go into flying camera and you do that

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.550 
to go into flying camera and you do that
by<00:03:06.099> hitting<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.790> Y<00:03:06.969> button<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:08.079> breaks

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
by hitting the Y button and that breaks

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.699 
by hitting the Y button and that breaks
you<00:03:08.769> out<00:03:08.950> into<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.730> free-roaming<00:03:10.510> camera<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you out into a free-roaming camera you

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.470 
you out into a free-roaming camera you
can<00:03:11.739> watch<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.159> from<00:03:12.189> above<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.909> can<00:03:13.269> see

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
can watch it from above and you can see

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.000 
can watch it from above and you can see
what<00:03:13.719> you<00:03:13.870> did<00:03:14.049> maybe<00:03:14.409> get<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> perspective

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
what you did maybe get a perspective

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.800 
what you did maybe get a perspective
where<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.519> can<00:03:15.640> actually<00:03:15.849> see<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.299> impact<00:03:16.689> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
where you can actually see the impact of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.990 
where you can actually see the impact of
that<00:03:16.870> grenade<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.379> through<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.980> zoom<00:03:18.879> in

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
that grenade you through and zoom in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.490 
that grenade you through and zoom in
really<00:03:19.209> closely<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.170> action<00:03:20.470> that

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
really closely on the action that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.190 
really closely on the action that
happened<00:03:20.859> after<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.540> there's<00:03:25.720> one<00:03:25.930> group

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
happened after that so there's one group

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.199 
happened after that so there's one group
who's<00:03:26.439> like<00:03:26.590> no<00:03:26.980> don't<00:03:27.519> allow<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.849> they're

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
who's like no don't allow it they're

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.910 
who's like no don't allow it they're
gonna<00:03:28.299> see<00:03:28.510> too<00:03:28.629> many<00:03:28.720> lies<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.469> a<00:03:29.530> pan<00:03:29.709> add

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
gonna see too many lies it's a pan add

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.860 
gonna see too many lies it's a pan add
the<00:03:30.189> other<00:03:30.459> side<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.760> was<00:03:30.819> like<00:03:31.000> look<00:03:31.209> flying

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the other side it was like look flying

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.259 
the other side it was like look flying
cam<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.200> cool<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:32.530> shit<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:33.370> actually<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.909> a<00:03:33.970> big

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
cam is cool as shit it actually is a big

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.660 
cam is cool as shit it actually is a big
deal<00:03:34.510> when<00:03:34.959> you're<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:35.799> flying<00:03:36.069> camera<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.579> you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
deal when you're in flying camera if you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.909 
deal when you're in flying camera if you
hold<00:03:36.879> in<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> left<00:03:37.329> trigger<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.769> can

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
hold in the left trigger you can

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.800 
hold in the left trigger you can
actually<00:03:39.189> fly<00:03:39.400> around<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.849> map<00:03:40.000> faster<00:03:40.629> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
actually fly around the map faster and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.250 
actually fly around the map faster and
then<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.530> right<00:03:41.799> trigger<00:03:42.129> is<00:03:42.489> your<00:03:43.450> speed

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
then the right trigger is your speed

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.890 
then the right trigger is your speed
control<00:03:44.799> if<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.519> hold<00:03:45.730> down<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.689> right

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
control if you hold down the right

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.750 
control if you hold down the right
trigger<00:03:47.109> in<00:03:47.349> just<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.680> little<00:03:47.919> you'll<00:03:48.430> notice

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
trigger in just a little you'll notice

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.780 
trigger in just a little you'll notice
it's<00:03:48.970> slow<00:03:49.569> motion<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.189> hold<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.669> in

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
it's slow motion and if you hold it in

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.479 
it's slow motion and if you hold it in
all<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> way<00:03:52.419> it<00:03:52.870> actually<00:03:53.139> becomes<00:03:54.099> fast

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
all the way it actually becomes fast

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.879 
all the way it actually becomes fast
forward<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.239> want<00:03:56.139> people<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.379> go<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.500> make

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
it's just crazy how much a map will

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.300 
it's just crazy how much a map will
change<00:04:24.190> with<00:04:24.820> just<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.659> small<00:04:26.289> variation<00:04:27.159> of

if you want to enforce you could build

so I'm doing a building out the fusion
coils<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.430> then<00:04:42.790> blow<00:04:43.450> it<00:04:43.630> up<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:45.730> can<00:04:45.910> have

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
coils and then blow it up you can have

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.300 
coils and then blow it up you can have
50<00:04:46.870> versions<00:04:47.200> of<00:04:47.290> sand<00:04:47.530> trap<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:47.980> are<00:04:48.160> each
