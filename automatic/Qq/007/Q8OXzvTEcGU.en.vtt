00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160
 ae 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 Just guys like I said that 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.910
 tutorial would be that two bars 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 the first must do the physical part 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 and the second electric 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.629
 the video would have made this culture 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.770
 and now let's set up and install some 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.280
 components to make the most 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.280
 interesting 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 in addition to the materials used in the video 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.620
 previous 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 We're going to need four high LEDs. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 brightness of transistors 31 or 42 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.410
 303 Uni resistors and a small box 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.410
 usb to computer 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.450
 even if the box full 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 taking all its components 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.030
 this first circuit is what makes 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 that buildings that according to the sound 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 in my case I will put on a good product 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.520
 but you only pay to call the children are 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.520
 Paulo 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.080
 the bridge will link the proponents is that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.000
 such on the earth very careful 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.000
 important for components 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.599
 with the planet is the talking boat you 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.599
 say that's it 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:07.769
 rock marked area so let's mount the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.269
 circuit is responsible for feeding the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.269
 speakers and also load the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.660
 phone will require a 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.170
 car 7 805 a chapter that must go 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.370
 although I do have a usb port and a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.370
 nine game battery 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.360
 I know also yes it could leave the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.360
 schema that tainÃ¡ dela 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:52.760
 the state after voting 10 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.819
 There are no more secrets now, but if you 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.290
 leave everything in the box 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.290
 the ten sheets switch and srsb 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 that's it, you thought the clip did not 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.759
 they acknowledged liked the jewelry too 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.100
 They write in the channel and has the worst the 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:26.110
 comments it is very important 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.110
 All good and even more.
