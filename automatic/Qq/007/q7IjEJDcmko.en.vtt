00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
think that the room for experimentation

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.760 
think that the room for experimentation
is<00:01:11.869> movie<00:01:12.869> posters<00:01:13.260> were<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> biggest

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
is movie posters were the biggest

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
is movie posters were the biggest
