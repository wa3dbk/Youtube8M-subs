outside is very easy to destroy using a
wall<00:03:03.299> breakers<00:03:03.690> that's<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.109> single<00:03:04.500> wall

can just use healing spells like what I

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.070 
can just use healing spells like what I
did<00:05:52.960> just<00:05:53.110> now<00:05:53.520> right<00:05:54.520> so<00:05:54.760> I'm<00:05:54.820> grew<00:05:55.060> wait<00:05:55.360> oh<00:05:55.540> i

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
did just now right so I'm grew wait oh i

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.380 
did just now right so I'm grew wait oh i
think<00:05:56.560> there's<00:05:56.860> one<00:05:56.980> more<00:05:57.370> i<00:05:57.610> can't<00:05:57.940> retrain

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
think there's one more i can't retrain

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.260 
think there's one more i can't retrain
so<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.140> lot<00:05:59.560> more<00:05:59.740> arches<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.550> make<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:00.820> faster

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
so a lot more arches to make it faster

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.840 
so a lot more arches to make it faster
and<00:06:03.570> that's<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.690> right<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:05.920> I<00:06:05.950> don't<00:06:06.580> need<00:06:06.670> some

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
and that's it right so I don't need some

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.490 
and that's it right so I don't need some
truth<00:06:07.060> to<00:06:07.240> my<00:06:07.360> friends<00:06:08.220> some<00:06:09.220> arches<00:06:09.640> for<00:06:09.910> them

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
truth to my friends some arches for them
