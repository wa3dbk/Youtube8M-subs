00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.350
 hey people get my new one 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.059
 Video 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.490
 I 'm just a little 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.590
 storm damage and would like to show you 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.930
 how I fix something like that quickly 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.740
 problem with storms or so 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.300
 bad weather 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.130
 once you have that in here right now 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.860
 In the autumn time you have something mostly 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.020
 for days that means you hardly have here 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.650
 a great way to do it 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.900
 repair 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.180
 because the weather is pretty bad 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.469
 permanently the underground mass is one 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.450
 has to come up with something 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.579
 In my case, these are all here 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.500
 connection plates loose partly even 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.350
 flew away and we have here now 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.510
 the following problem more raining into the object 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.070
 inside it did not look that looks as if 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.270
 she 'll fix it for the next few days 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.760
 I have to see here that I am fast 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.399
 a solution can quickly find this roof 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.480
 re-seal connection so that we 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.030
 here in the truest sense of the word 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.770
 Word does not the Bible expire so there 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.930
 we do not have many possibilities there 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.360
 It's like said everything is very wet 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.739
 I can only following variant here 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.089
 Either I find the metal sheets again 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.469
 but unfortunately they will never be seen again 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.930
 flown away 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.220
 or I apply here such 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.510
 sweatbands are available in 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 different versions 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.409
 For example, we have such a band here 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.150
 this is a kind of mixing with romp 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.960
 aluminum coated and with a kind 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.060
 the sweat path or the bigger bender 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 so flexible bender with several of the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.290
 welding tracks can we here 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.450
 muster and beneficial it is we 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.930
 you can short with a trainer 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.020
 heat up and so lets weld here 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.720
 Stick so that this can be tight 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 and we will do the roof first 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.930
 have sealed up at least the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.810
 rain stops and then we can still 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.400
 a loading area just over it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.830
 bring so I'll show you how I do 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.230
 to make that fast 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 So first we start by 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.610
 just first the sweat lanes 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 roll out and seal before sealing 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.980
 position it so we can 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.780
 can work reasonably so now 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.550
 we finalize the remaining area 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.630
 removed and we see here the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.120
 surface is quite strong 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.250
 so we clean them first 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.650
 with a sponge or a cloth like that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 that we are reasonably our thermes here 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 can stick to so next lege 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 I now my sweat trails in front of the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.020
 closing gap 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.610
 In the back, the Swiss Railway has one 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.740
 tarry layer which one acquires 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.060
 can and therefore can feed, so to speak 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.840
 that is here of such a protective layer 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.640
 protected we just pull off and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.520
 Now position the sweatband on the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.830
 to be connected to the band leave 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.200
 I survive something so that it ends up 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.820
 the roof was not cut flush 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.850
 so i can protect something it can 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.640
 to the outside something outweighs so 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.070
 that it seals again outside now 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.110
 I push the tape towards the wall and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.090
 bend it slightly in the right angle 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.880
 so a little rounding in the middle 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.239
 arises important does not press it too deeply 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.450
 otherwise we have a small city â€‹â€‹where 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.690
 water can accumulate too 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.310
 important to mention you have 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.290
 between the roof material for example 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 the roof panels and the wall too much 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.160
 distance that means she is behind this 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.200
 You have to have some freedom 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.330
 may bring a wooden lath or 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.850
 something else says otherwise 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.420
 your sweatband at this point through 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.220
 and leaves sooner or later than 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.980
 next you me with the tape carefully 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.650
 a burner does not heat up so much 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.690
 that behind the aluminum track burns 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.810
 Just gently heat and 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.070
 press it against the wall and down to this 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.780
 sheet metal plates 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.580
 Here I recommend you used 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.980
 gloves or uses an object 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.440
 like a hammerstiel around switzerland 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.090
 train to press because if you with the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.769
 it is probably touching the hands 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.769
 too hot and he burns your hands 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.239
 and should he or she be active 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.519
 substance to the hands 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.750
 This really burns into the skin 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.850
 one and it can be too bad 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 injuries thus lead carefully 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.980
 like this 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.049
 and another important tip if you are with 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 the burner on house walls or on 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.370
 Roofing works so well that he does so 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.769
 nothing ignited or in any way 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.329
 form exists because that can be very fast 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.659
 happen that the flames are in 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.400
 to move in and out of some gap 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.350
 then through a kind of capital effect 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.840
 literally sucked into the roof 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.150
 and ignite something there so 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.490
 always careful not to light anything 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.169
 in this whole story like that and 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.180
 We have the sweatband with it 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.070
 attached and the roof sealed 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.919
 which is also nice with this method 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.750
 You can feel like that during the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.060
 rain showers help and the roof 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.470
 seal and in hindsight I can 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.270
 now even here again 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.520
 apply normal sheet metal there that 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.099
 sweat trains that there the switzerland railway 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.400
 or the sweatband are pretty thin 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.620
 I can do this again a sheet on it 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.500
 apply and almost like that again 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.070
 in addition, seal the roof 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.570
 You can also use this method for one 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.909
 can schlot edging and use 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.550
 so that the bottom border too 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.860
 seal around again and again 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.400
 then, as I said, sometimes sheets about it 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.659
 bring and thus has an additional 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.659
 covering protection achieved 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.789
 so and that only today of mine 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.080
 page and if you are interested again 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.639
 other videos you have below I have 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.560
 you again linked a few so 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.150
 I said it until next time 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.150
