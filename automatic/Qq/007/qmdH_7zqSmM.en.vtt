00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
for the car so the the same CAD data

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480 
for the car so the the same CAD data
that<00:00:16.750> they<00:00:16.869> use<00:00:17.109> to<00:00:17.140> prototype<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:17.920> cars<00:00:18.190> we

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
that they use to prototype the cars we

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.450 
that they use to prototype the cars we
had<00:00:18.670> we<00:00:18.910> actually<00:00:19.210> had<00:00:19.360> a<00:00:19.390> company<00:00:19.950> DST<00:00:20.950> out<00:00:21.280> of

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
had we actually had a company DST out of

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.670

Detroit we hand off those files to him
and<00:00:23.860> he<00:00:24.160> would<00:00:24.280> actually<00:00:24.369> build<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:25.000> cars

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
and he would actually build the cars

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.820 
and he would actually build the cars
because<00:00:25.420> we'll<00:00:25.570> need<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.810> used<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.260> every<00:00:26.590> car

within<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.750> process<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.260> designing<00:04:01.650> all<00:04:02.310> of

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
within the process of designing all of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.890 
within the process of designing all of
the<00:04:02.640> sets<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.030> all<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.330> action<00:04:03.600> obviously

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
the sets and all the action obviously

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.450 
the sets and all the action obviously
the<00:04:04.020> action<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> most<00:04:04.680> important<00:04:05.220> thing

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
the action is the most important thing

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.700 
the action is the most important thing
to<00:04:05.490> him<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.540> he<00:04:06.690> wants<00:04:06.990> us<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.230> spend<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.590> most

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
to him so he wants us to spend the most

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.900 
to him so he wants us to spend the most
amount<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:08.160> money<00:04:08.340> where<00:04:08.610> there's<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> most

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
amount of money where there's the most

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.530 
amount of money where there's the most
amount<00:04:09.270> of<00:04:09.950> physical<00:04:10.950> action<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:12.210> it<00:04:12.330> really

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
amount of physical action so it really

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.990 
amount of physical action so it really
were<00:04:12.750> trying<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.140> put<00:04:13.350> every<00:04:13.710> spare<00:04:14.340> penny<00:04:14.370> we

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
were trying to put every spare penny we

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.410 
were trying to put every spare penny we
could<00:04:15.300> into<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.380> ending<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> film<00:04:17.420> which

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
could into the ending of the film which

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.960 
could into the ending of the film which

start shooting third week of August and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.519 
start shooting third week of August and
there's<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.389> lot<00:05:26.569> to<00:05:26.719> do<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:27.050> we've<00:05:27.169> got<00:05:27.199> a<00:05:27.319> big

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 
there's a lot to do is we've got a big

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.829 
there's a lot to do is we've got a big
colonnade<00:05:28.129> it<00:05:28.729> goes<00:05:28.939> down<00:05:29.149> the<00:05:29.330> center<00:05:29.659> these

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:29.839 
colonnade it goes down the center these

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.629 
colonnade it goes down the center these
buildings<00:05:30.379> and<00:05:30.589> they<00:05:30.710> all<00:05:30.860> need<00:05:31.069> to<00:05:31.189> fall<00:05:31.430> and

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
buildings and they all need to fall and

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.100 
buildings and they all need to fall and
explode<00:05:32.029> in<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.300> certain<00:05:32.479> way<00:05:32.629> so<00:05:32.779> there's

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
explode in a certain way so there's

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.010 
explode in a certain way so there's
going<00:05:33.199> to<00:05:33.289> be<00:05:33.849> special<00:05:34.849> effects<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.449> their

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
going to be special effects and their

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.559 
going to be special effects and their
crew<00:05:36.379> making<00:05:37.159> sure<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:37.699> that<00:05:37.939> all<00:05:38.149> happens

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
crew making sure that that all happens

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.389 
crew making sure that that all happens
in<00:05:38.719> the<00:05:38.779> proper<00:05:39.199> way<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.409> we<00:05:39.800> follow<00:05:40.099> behind

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:40.399 
in the proper way and we follow behind

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.579 
in the proper way and we follow behind
them<00:05:40.759> to<00:05:40.969> touch<00:05:41.120> everything<00:05:41.419> up<00:05:41.719> and<00:05:41.959> smooth

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
them to touch everything up and smooth

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:43.989 
them to touch everything up and smooth
it<00:05:42.740> over<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.159> it<00:05:43.249> looks<00:05:43.399> like<00:05:43.459> we<00:05:43.669> haven't<00:05:43.969> done

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:43.999 
it over so it looks like we haven't done

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:46.329 
it over so it looks like we haven't done
a<00:05:44.149> thing<00:05:44.240> greens<00:05:44.899> has<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.319> come<00:05:45.529> in<00:05:45.559> and<00:05:46.009> add

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
palm trees and more brush we got to

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.489 
palm trees and more brush we got to
scoop<00:05:49.189> the<00:05:49.339> sand<00:05:49.639> around<00:05:49.879> and<00:05:50.419> make<00:05:50.990> our<00:05:51.229> dunes
