00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.529
 samy deluxe yes nice that you are back 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.280
 are sincerely welcome to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.080
 land sent bambi for integration yes 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.550
 I had yes I had thilo sarrazin 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 suggested that would be my main 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 top scorer has been similarly much for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 integration but also earned 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430
 I do not know how it feels 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.439
 Integration looks like integration 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.390
 than that sees what it should be or 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 than that she is what so far 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.400
 accordingly , maybe it's whole 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.140
 well placed so to speak the rap 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.989
 scene from which you come already denser 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.579
 others from the than the one from the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.079
 bushido comes so to speak from 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 musical as well as lyrical 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 Christian background or yes, but 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 Ultimately my hip hop is one too 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 music direction yes where then everything 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 lumped together if 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.760
 I have no idea about frank happ 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.680
 is good for you too collins 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.660
 maybe the same because of frank band 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.660
 But DÃ¼sseldorf is not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.850
 So everything works out for me, everything is hip 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.079
 hop and it just gives it different 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.730
 I did not like it that way 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 to travel purely in this whole terror 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.610
 yes it opens yes are now 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.979
 many indeed works well and yet 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 now is the whole album 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.130
 sung then it is also clear that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 actually a rap album under the new one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.040
 single is the only really from the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.180
 sung integrate which is made I 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 the only thing that made it to the album 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.630
 that's a very interesting one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.979
 style like you do not sing for me so far 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.210
 Trained singer in the linden trees 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.880
 Bergisch is kinda a bit 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.549
 even long so yes a bit on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.890
 bit of afro mane a bit 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.630
 what about poison is also like that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.250
 with me is still a bit sun 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.630
 so rapper so if I 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.770
 just somehow in the chain 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.690
 if you invite me now you would 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.890
 you should with the heavytones 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.720
 retirement home coup number I could sing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 I think technically singing better than 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.020
 I can sing him samy deluxe song 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 because as a singer I still have 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 somehow still caught and can 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.110
 then do not dive into these chork boys 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.280
 I also have a lot of a cappella 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.659
 rapped this year I have a lot on 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 I have made my website 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.380
 also to present that rap 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 it works just without music 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.890
 primarily a political one 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.840
 We have short deliveries 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 seen also in the excerpt at the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.750
 tv total tv teams that one with a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.739
 can save cappella 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:22.750
 there rausholen what because now yours 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.390
 musical goal is more and more 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.900
 continue into the seerische corner so to speak 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.970
 to move or are you open to everything 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.319
 Actually, it's more like the moment 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.610
 take as he comes so I have just 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.390
 for the album there are now I believe 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.070
 16 17 songs on it and I have since march 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.150
 Worked on it in 2010 and at the moment 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.530
 where I had to decide which 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.380
 I think songs came on the album 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.190
 I 120 since I really had a lot 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.470
 because I also own more now 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.750
 just produce a great deal of output 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.400
 had this year I've 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.019
 chosen and there are many successful 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.910
 thing then somehow fallen away 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.250
 but I thought it does not make sense 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.810
 a rap album some reggae song 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.549
 to do this for me in this case because of me 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.780
 had a lot of reggae last night and 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.040
 the song we just saw 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.690
 one day is something for me 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.190
 actually become a singer 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.150
 songwriter ballad but somehow 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.709
 then by the art of 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.989
 instrumentation so a bit hip hop 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.430
 got character I found fit 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.489
 just into the overall concept so I am 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.480
 still rapper and also like 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.340
 actually better again than before 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.040
 a few years where it is always the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.209
 negative military the dear rapper though 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.209
 I'm a good rapper too 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.079
 I think this again 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.519
 kunstform so I have a lot again 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.530
 You can easily win last years 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.340
 Enjoy my watchmen and rhyme 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.379
 had and im 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.269
 Do not be fooled by what you 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.069
 the rest of germany is now over 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.660
 current deutschrap think and say ey 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.489
 fell ten years ago and everyone 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.110
 so that one of established German 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.160
 Music like that and I think you can do it 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.120
 Also back down he is, he comes as 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.190
 again of ten years hunt musically 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.500
 four decades through first so that's true 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.360
 starts again somehow in the 70s 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.709
 80s 90s and the best of today and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.030
 then it starts all over again 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.640
 the same the americans are doing now 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.530
 only eurodance nineties euro that 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.120
 is really very fascinated and interesting 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.660
 or every cent we here in our 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.970
 has heard youth now says wolf 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.220
 but we are the amis ahead of mine 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.310
 Names tna ladies and gentlemen here with 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:21.400
