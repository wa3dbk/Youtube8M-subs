00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 how to choose and take care of extensions 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.680
 hair women are not easy to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.139
 understand when we have the hair 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.670
 short nostalgia gives us the mane 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.940
 that we had before cutting it because 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.940
 we were tired of handling it and when 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 we are years letting us grow our hair 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.420
 for now we think about how fast 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
 We left the salon when 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.890
 we had short and little time 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.359
 we invest in the house arranging what is not 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 It's a matter of no one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.460
 understand how men sometimes say 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.770
 or that we are dissatisfied but that we 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 like versatility, variety and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 be able to change our image to not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 bored as we can not speak to the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 hair so that it grows immediately 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.719
 as if we were a doll someone 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.340
 he thought of our fascination for being 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.989
 chameleon and he almost invented the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.199
 extensions but at affordable prices 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.670
