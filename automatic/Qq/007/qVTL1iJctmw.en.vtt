00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
lack thereof basically what we've done

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
lack thereof basically what we've done
is<00:01:44.810> we've<00:01:44.960> come<00:01:45.170> together<00:01:45.440> as<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.710> team<00:01:46.009> between

is we've come together as a team between

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.279 
is we've come together as a team between

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the farrier and it was determined that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.840 
the farrier and it was determined that
what<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.929> need<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.259> do<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.649> actually<00:01:51.890> not<00:01:52.520> just

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
what we need to do is actually not just

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.120 
what we need to do is actually not just
balance<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.450> feet<00:01:53.659> four<00:01:53.960> feet<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.830> we<00:01:54.979> need

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
balance the feet four feet but we need

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.120 
balance the feet four feet but we need
to<00:01:55.280> balance<00:01:55.460> him<00:01:55.940> through<00:01:56.479> his<00:01:56.630> whole<00:01:56.869> body<00:01:57.140> so

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
to balance him through his whole body so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.309 
to balance him through his whole body so
probably<00:01:58.670> through<00:01:59.030> time<00:01:59.330> he's<00:01:59.810> been<00:02:00.020> trimmed

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
probably through time he's been trimmed

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.260 
probably through time he's been trimmed
and<00:02:00.440> shot<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.710> particular<00:02:01.369> way<00:02:01.549> looking<00:02:02.030> at<00:02:02.149> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and shot a particular way looking at the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.120 
and shot a particular way looking at the
undersides<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.750> his<00:02:03.140> feet<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.649> bottom<00:02:04.039> of
