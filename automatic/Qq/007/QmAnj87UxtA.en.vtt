air-cooled v-twin the Col we its engine
is<00:00:36.500> smaller<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.130> it's<00:00:37.280> liquid<00:00:37.700> cool<00:00:37.910> so

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
is smaller and it's liquid cool so

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.490 
is smaller and it's liquid cool so
you've<00:00:38.180> got<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.570> radiator<00:00:39.080> kind<00:00:39.410> of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
you've got that radiator kind of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.310 
you've got that radiator kind of
clogging<00:00:40.010> up<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.190> front<00:00:40.580> end<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.870> bolts<00:00:42.140> got

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
clogging up the front end the bolts got

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.310 
clogging up the front end the bolts got
a<00:00:42.350> tight<00:00:42.710> 60<00:00:43.310> 1.8<00:00:44.060> inch<00:00:44.360> wheelbase<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.080> it's<00:00:45.230> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
a tight 60 1.8 inch wheelbase so it's a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.430 
a tight 60 1.8 inch wheelbase so it's a
breeze<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.890> maneuver<00:00:46.340> in<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.700> out<00:00:46.760> of<00:00:46.910> traffic
