00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello, let's show today that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.790
 can be done if you do not work 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 keyboard on a laptop 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.009
 the second question I was asked which 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.240
 put me in a stupor how to turn on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 keyboard on a laptop 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.609
 that is, if you take the moment physically as 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 turn on here keyboard from laptop 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 you can enable parsing and connecting here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.260
 This train I do not know what the author of this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.920
 the question meant how to turn on maybe 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.360
 keyboard when it does not work 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 the keyboard on the laptop should work 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 by default here I have hewlett if with 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 the keyboard is ok and it 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 connected, that is, it should work 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 no buttons on or off 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 keyboard and here is how to connect 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 keyboard when they work and what 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 do when they work let's briefly 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.969
 I will tell that is the first I would like 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.020
 raise the question why may not 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840
 work keyboard 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 the main cause of inoperability 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.479
 culture is and and pour and that is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.340
 when we fill it with liquid 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.260
 inside the keyboard itself this liquid 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.740
 end contracts either frets 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.439
 contacts and disappears 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 let's say a contact between this one 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.520
 loops which goes to laptop and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.380
 keys that is, if you kill one 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.330
 the keyboard track will turn off 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.310
 some block of keys on one track 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 hanging a few keys that come true 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 everyone's keyboard works there 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.450
 keys except there 5 6 8 keys 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 it means killed one track if 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 the keyboard does not work at all that is not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.090
 reacts to nothing there are two 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 option or she is short and therefore 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.590
 no signal at all they pass either 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.640
 the second version of it someone raised let's say 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 so from the laptop and did not insert the cable on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.149
 place or loop in place put crooked 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.829
 that is, culture does not work first 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.530
 By removing the keyboard, you can 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.719
 video on each to find a laptop 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 separately because on every laptop 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:08.069
 The keyboard is removed in its own way 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.810
 Usually this here as here for cheeks here 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.690
 top in these phases stand for alkali 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.970
 which we push back and just think 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 the culture itself but here in this 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.900
 the keyboard still has two bolts 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.880
 fixing whether one here is one bolt 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 fastening if there is no fastening bolts then 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.270
 just she latch comes off and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.590
 rises now what to do if she 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.690
 you are not working but we must work 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 connect a regular keyboard to a laptop 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.880
 from our 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.959
 I am not an ordinary computer here at 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.810
 I have a keyboard brand Dan here 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.810
 ordinary usb connector i take 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:57.570
 connecting this yusb connector to your 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.680
 samsung laptop and here I look at this 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.850
 keyboard typing 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:10.380
 and we have characters that I 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.540
 click if you have no money on 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.510
 the keyboard is new because now connections 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.049
 with the increase in the dollar keyboard 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.180
 same will cost I do not know probably from 2000 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.030
 from one and a half to two to three thousand 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.739
 not everyone can afford and say 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.200
 so on old laptops which price 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.030
 about the same range does not make sense 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.340
 buy new, you can search of course 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.140
 Bush well in service centers with us 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.989
 let's order on by 3 dozen 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.760
 Keyboards have a parse 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.920
 but not the fact that you will find such 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.570
 it is necessary then we connect for you 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.920
 external usb keyboard and calm 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.390
 working on it keyboard so i click 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.340
 number 4 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.640
 we see that only four appear on 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 screen there is another option i 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.799
 faced with the fact that connecting external 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.299
 the keyboard does not work 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.370
 the reason for this was short 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.970
 short circuit in the most basic keyboard 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.970
 laptop 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.340
 that is, if you do not work externally 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 keyboard then you have to remove the keyboard 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.760
 your laptop 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.280
 unplug it and just put in place 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.729
 not connecting so as not to spoil the external 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.970
 the view and the keyboard also has a protective 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.290
 function protects the insides and on 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.810
 some laptops and not 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.600
 use flour without keyboard because 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.540
 that the keyboard has a metallic 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.010
 footboard 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.470
 here she is specifically this bad 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.240
 culture and fill immediately everything falls 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.770
 in the laptop that is, you can kill the laptop 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 have a keyboard that has 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 all-metal substrate and also she 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.200
 performs the function of the heat sink that is to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.440
 she goes 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.130
 from laptop items anytime chips 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.280
 either from bridges top heat conductive 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.650
 gasket and keyboard takes part 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.680
 heat on itself and dissipates and and if without 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 keyboards include such laptops 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.910
 one moment that will overheat 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.970
 turn on and the second point is what can 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.090
 the result of this is simply fail 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.860
 everything 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.840
 if the video was helpful to you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.440
 like signed feed all good luck 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.440
 until
