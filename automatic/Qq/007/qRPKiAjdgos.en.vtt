00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.839
 cold friends as they are today I'm going to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 Give a very small and effective tips 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.179
 how to achieve that level does not run 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.059
 first of all the mascara is to test 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.699
 of water guard plus should be the most 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.699
 effective so that it does not run is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.060
 terrible , however , it is not always 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 well and the mascara differs a lot from one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 person to another has not happened to them 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 recommend a remedy to you as 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.450
 they do not like much and the other 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 person works for you then if the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 It's a pity that we're discarding when 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 we finish those mascara is that flat not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.160
 works 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.370
 I have a video that I will leave as 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.920
 video response that is super old 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.489
 and in the time of the dinosaurs but it's 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.039
 so effective because it talks about how to choose 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.170
 a mascara will help them not 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.960
 wrong to know what is important 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.729
 on the river but let's start with this 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.519
 tip that I hope will help you very much 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.430
 The first thing I want to tell you is that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.580
 the river when it's like this a little thin 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.700
 It helps us a lot to not run 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.460
 choose a mascara the brush that is not 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.979
 so fat because those brushes mess up 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.009
 a lot we're going to start with a layer of 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.289
 vibe and remember that sometimes less is 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.259
 most of the problems that are 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.479
 come to have with the mascara is the excess 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.819
 people who are like spiders and what 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.700
 happens is that you are the mascara is too much and 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.140
 begins to hit with the whole eye ok 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.649
 a light layer starting from the root 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 towards the tips ok that's all that is 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.979
 our first layer we are going to take 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.930
 Vaseline does not stand in a small amount 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.560
 almost not even 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.040
 human we could detect the we were going to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 caress only our lashes with 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.780
 Vaseline that does not enter the eye now 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.990
 they are going to take a complexion like that 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.679
 up and they will remove all the excess 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.700
 of the mascara of the first layer with what 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.050
 they were applying mascara ok there 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.050
 let's go take translucent powder with 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.620
 a skewer and they will also apply what 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.620
 minimum 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.330
 at the tips on the lower lashes 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.480
 caressing nothing else now they will choose 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.659
 a brand waterproof mascara that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.879
 you want for the last layer or 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.190
 tip that I will give you is that if you 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.099
 they feel that the mascara is very like that 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.190
 very pasty clean the excesses in a 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.340
 Kleenex so that this does not mess up the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.099
 application 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.099
 and now we are going to apply generous layers 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.920
 to stop the mascara like this and flat like 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 comb 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.430
 if they are going to use mascara on the eyelashes 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.920
 down if I recommend that they watered and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.530
 that nothing else to take out and 100 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.930
 to wait for the mascara to go 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.330
 to use a concealer and here it is very 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.790
 important the quality of the proofreader 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.880
 because if it is very fatty, that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.040
 mascara was also agreed the creampie of 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.069
 Ojito that we put you have to be careful 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.709
 that is not very greasy because everything 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.239
 this causes the bm to run the 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.250
 corrector that I am using from the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.050
 brand anastasia space and what can 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.070
 buy on my website 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.070
 upwards 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.180
 when the corrector is good what 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.330
 it happens is that it lasts much longer 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.370
 I want to see time difference 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.050
 the two eyes and this eye has nothing more 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.630
 mascara has nothing else and neither 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.420
 massive amounts but this mascara already 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.980
 is fixed even notice how easy it is 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.210
 I 'm going to do I 'm going to take the corrector more 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.810
 clear and I'm going to apply it here as 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.810
 highlight 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.389
 and with the clearer again I'm going to 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.389
 give a light 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.259
 so that the eye looks truly 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.570
 much more beautiful bigger I do not have 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.039
 nothing but laugh I feel that you can see 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.310
 spectacular now imagine yourself 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.009
 putting everything else 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.259
 in french facility that I have for the 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.860
 French can take the mascara and I'm going to 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.340
 use it in the other eye nothing more like this without 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.120
 Apply the powder without applying the basilica 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.389
 notice how here alone I got stained 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.520
 a tip that I'm going to give you is the mascara 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.250
 remove when it is dry 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.830
 ok when it is close to you 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.810
 they remove the book but you here I had 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.690
 to stop because I started to stain 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.479
 the whole ojito I just started and in this 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.699

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.580
