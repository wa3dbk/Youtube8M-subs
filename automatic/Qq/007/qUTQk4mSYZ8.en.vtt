out of Scrolls

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
out of Scrolls
so<00:01:32.110> based<00:01:32.830> on<00:01:33.100> how<00:01:33.430> much<00:01:33.729> power<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.450> each<00:01:34.750> gives

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.639 
so based on how much power in each gives

and B stuff like that please excuse me

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.200 
and B stuff like that please excuse me
based<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.250> will<00:01:42.369> require<00:01:42.729> different

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
based on that it will require different

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.340 
based on that it will require different
amount<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.600> spell<00:01:43.840> tricks

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
amount of spell tricks

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.260 
amount of spell tricks
so<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.890> see<00:01:44.950> 100<00:01:45.310> percent<00:01:45.789> at<00:01:45.909> actual

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
so as you can see 100 percent at actual

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.639 
so as you can see 100 percent at actual
gives<00:01:46.539> one<00:01:46.840> weapon<00:01:47.140> attack<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.619> only

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
gives one weapon attack and only

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.680 
gives one weapon attack and only
requires<00:01:48.100> five<00:01:48.659> 70%<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.810> cars<00:01:50.049> 7<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.690> +3

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
requires five 70% of cars 7 and +3

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.600 
requires five 70% of cars 7 and +3
weapon<00:01:53.170> attack<00:01:53.380> requires<00:01:53.740> eight<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.399> we<00:01:54.429> have

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
weapon attack requires eight so we have

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.880 
weapon attack requires eight so we have
eight<00:01:54.759> but<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.390> want<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.780> go<00:01:55.869> with<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.110> 70%<00:01:56.560> of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
eight but I want to go with a 70% of

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.770
