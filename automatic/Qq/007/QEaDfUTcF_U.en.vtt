hopefully you guys can see I got the FI
mm<00:00:21.199> right<00:00:23.510> here<00:00:28.250> hanging<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
mm right here hanging right here and I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.340 
mm right here hanging right here and I
got<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:32.520> under<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:35.960> spark<00:00:36.960> plug<00:00:37.140> wire

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
got it right under the spark plug wire

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.639 
got it right under the spark plug wire
right<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.540> as<00:00:39.540> high<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.020> could<00:00:40.079> run<00:00:40.530> up

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
right in there as high as I could run up

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.680 
right in there as high as I could run up
up<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> head<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.940> remember<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
up the head now remember you have to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.979 
up the head now remember you have to
take<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.890> covers<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.600> pull

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
take out the covers which is just pull

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.090 
take out the covers which is just pull
out<00:00:46.879> with<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.059> three<00:00:48.239> pins<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.860> I<00:00:49.860> took

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
out with these three pins here I took

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
out with these three pins here I took
them<00:00:50.370> both<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.480> easier<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
them both out because it was easier and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
them both out because it was easier and
you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> plenty<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> more<00:00:53.940> room<00:00:55.640> matter<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you have plenty of more room matter of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.590 
you have plenty of more room matter of
fact<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> show<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> looks

fact I'm going to show you how it looks

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.380 
fact I'm going to show you how it looks
from<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> other<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:01.230> without<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.620> cover

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
from the other side without the cover

from the other side without the cover
always<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.539> guys<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> thing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
always you guys can see the the thing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
always you guys can see the the thing
without<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> cover<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:12.740> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
without the cover and here it is it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
without the cover and here it is it
pulls<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> same<00:01:14.460> ways<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pulls out the same ways get the the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.550 
pulls out the same ways get the the
pieces<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.350> rubber<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:18.200> just<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> away

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pieces of rubber here just put it away

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
pieces of rubber here just put it away
now<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.070> doesn't<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.520> scratched<00:01:23.360> anyway<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
now it doesn't get scratched anyway you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.670 
now it doesn't get scratched anyway you
can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> cable<00:01:26.180> right<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.689> put<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
can see the cable right in here put it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
can see the cable right in here put it
as<00:01:28.770> high<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.950> possible<00:01:29.479> it's<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.840> it's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
as high as possible it's not that it's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
as high as possible it's not that it's
going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> burn<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.560> anything<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.159> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
going to burn or anything but it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.950 
going to burn or anything but it's
better<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> way

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
better that you get it out of the way

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.440 
better that you get it out of the way
anyways<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.380> getting<00:01:37.590> ready<00:01:38.450> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
anyways I'm going to be getting ready to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.260 
anyways I'm going to be getting ready to
connect<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> after<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.930> move<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:44.030> couple<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
connect it so after we move a couple of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.950 
connect it so after we move a couple of
cables<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:48.030> should<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.869> each

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
cables and that should be it one on each

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.130 
cables and that should be it one on each
side<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:50.299> connect<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> other<00:01:51.600> ones<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.189> so

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
side and connect the other ones in so

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
side and connect the other ones in so
it's<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.560> right<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.100> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it's going to be right in there like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's going to be right in there like
that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:17.580 

this<00:02:04.909> thing<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.330> doesn't<00:02:05.720> move<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:09.679> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.240 

so<00:02:18.590> anyway<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.870> get<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.760> feeling<00:02:22.760> sectors<00:02:23.120> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
so anyway I get the feeling sectors I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.110 
so anyway I get the feeling sectors I
got<00:02:25.250> one<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:25.850> each<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.819> should<00:02:28.819> be<00:02:28.940> pretty

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
got one for each so should be pretty

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.970 
got one for each so should be pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:31.989> one<00:02:32.989> my<00:02:33.140> instructions<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
self-explanatory one my instructions to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.120 
self-explanatory one my instructions to
fly<00:02:34.190> away<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.700> got<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.870> here

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.460 

so<00:02:40.130> essentially<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> plug<00:02:41.239> one<00:02:41.540> plug

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so essentially you on the plug one plug

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.590 
so essentially you on the plug one plug
the<00:02:42.650> other<00:02:42.769> one<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:50.090> unplug<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
the other one in and just unplug the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.040 
the other one in and just unplug the
other<00:02:50.810> one<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:53.890> plug<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.100> other<00:02:55.220> one<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:56.050> so

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
other one and plug the other one in so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
other one and plug the other one in so
you<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:57.739> want<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.160> sure<00:02:58.430> let's<00:03:00.070> connect

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you just want to be sure let's connect

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.090 
you just want to be sure let's connect
that<00:03:01.130> see<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> connector<00:03:02.480> there<00:03:02.920> looks<00:03:03.920> just

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
that see the connector there looks just

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.210 
that see the connector there looks just
like<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.579> one<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:07.180> I'm<00:03:08.180> going<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:09.220> it

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
like that one so I'm going to do this it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:20.330 
like that one so I'm going to do this it
goes<00:03:10.489> front<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.120> front<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:14.360> goes<00:03:14.540> like<00:03:14.810> that

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.210 

can<00:03:20.910> hardly<00:03:21.180> see<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
can hardly see there you go the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.340 
can hardly see there you go the
connector<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:25.770> one<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> other<00:03:27.930> one

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
connector so that one and the other one

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.690 
connector so that one and the other one
just<00:03:29.540> connected<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> black<00:03:33.630> one

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.630 

so<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:39.190> keep<00:03:39.370> track<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:41.160> other<00:03:42.160> ones<00:03:42.550> you

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so just keep track of the other ones you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.030 
so just keep track of the other ones you
plug<00:03:42.970> them<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.300> into<00:03:43.660> then<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.620> other<00:03:44.770> one<00:03:45.010> is

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
plug them in into then the other one is

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.130 
plug them in into then the other one is
way<00:03:45.760> back<00:03:46.030> here<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.660> almost<00:03:49.810> looks

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
way back here and it almost looks

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.290 
way back here and it almost looks
difficult<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.980> take<00:03:51.160> out<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:52.660> be<00:03:52.840> patient

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.190 

and<00:03:58.300> it's<00:03:58.510> right<00:03:58.720> there

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and it's right there

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.020 
and it's right there
so<00:03:59.980> what<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.190> would<00:04:00.340> recommend<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:01.000> putting

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
so what I would recommend is putting

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.220 
so what I would recommend is putting
this<00:04:01.450> one<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.780> first<00:04:02.519> just<00:04:03.519> like<00:04:03.730> so

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
this one in first just like so

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.660 
this one in first just like so
front<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.350> rear<00:04:05.440> they're<00:04:06.099> labeled<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.640> can

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
front and rear they're labeled you can

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.789 
front and rear they're labeled you can
possibly<00:04:07.540> miss<00:04:07.780> them<00:04:07.959> okay<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:10.950> just<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.130> so

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
possibly miss them okay so just like so

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.349 
possibly miss them okay so just like so
okay<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:18.040> then<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.340> other<00:04:18.370> one<00:04:18.790> goes<00:04:19.060> on

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
okay so and then the other one goes on

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.010 
okay so and then the other one goes on
the<00:04:20.079> one<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.470> back<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.010> rear<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.900> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
the one in the back and the rear and you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.680 
the one in the back and the rear and you
hear<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.350> click<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.910> as<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.150> hear<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.419> clicks

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
hear the click so as you hear the clicks

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.280 
hear the click so as you hear the clicks
you're<00:04:28.900> good<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.510> never<00:04:31.750> miss<00:04:32.020> this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
you're good now you can never miss this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.040 
you're good now you can never miss this

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because it's got the F on the rear the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.960 
because it's got the F on the rear the
front<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.560> rear<00:04:35.590> these<00:04:36.460> are<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.700> ones<00:04:36.880> I

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
that okay you could actually take one of

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.000 
that okay you could actually take one of
the<00:04:54.270> tie<00:04:55.270> wraps<00:04:55.539> that<00:04:55.750> came<00:04:56.020> with<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.500> kit<00:04:56.740> and

the tie wraps that came with the kit and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.460 
the tie wraps that came with the kit and
time<00:04:57.940> together<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.539> way<00:04:58.780> they<00:04:58.960> don't<00:04:59.169> float

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
time together that way they don't float

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.120 
time together that way they don't float
around<00:04:59.590> all<00:04:59.979> over<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.250> place<00:05:00.570> okay<00:05:02.010> just<00:05:03.010> be

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
around all over the place okay just be

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.290 
around all over the place okay just be
sure<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.580> connectors<00:05:04.060> are<00:05:05.490> solidly<00:05:06.490> pressing

that way they don't come out you can see
in<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.200> instructions<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:12.479> pigtail<00:05:13.479> goes<00:05:13.930> to

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
in the instructions that pigtail goes to

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.840 
in the instructions that pigtail goes to
the<00:05:14.229> front<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.710> then<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:15.130> one<00:05:15.340> that's<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.760> the
