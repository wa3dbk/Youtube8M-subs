00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
start off with a basic technique you're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
start off with a basic technique you're
going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> strike<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.820> back<00:00:21.060> side<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it's going to tap tap and come back then

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.400 
it's going to tap tap and come back then
you<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> bring<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.660> hand<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:27.960> again

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so it's like a small circle so you want

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
so it's like a small circle so you want
to<00:00:30.060> go<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:33.260> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> listen<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to go it's not want to listen to the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:01:08.660 
to go it's not want to listen to the
sound<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:59.539> again<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> need<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> reset

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
reset it there we go

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
reset it there we go
you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> always<00:01:10.950> instead<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:11.700> many<00:01:11.909> bags

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you can always instead of how many bags

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
you can always instead of how many bags
twice<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.500> about<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> there

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
twice you can get about one so is there

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
twice you can get about one so is there
it's<00:01:14.939> constant<00:01:15.509> beating<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> speedball<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's constant beating on speedball so

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.980 
it's constant beating on speedball so
you<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> build<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> bit<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> river

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.020 

that's<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> small<00:01:28.500> circle<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.549> moving

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that's like a small circle you're moving

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
that's like a small circle you're moving
I<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> small<00:01:31.409> circle

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
favorite techniques like it because it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.680 
favorite techniques like it because it
it<00:02:19.470> flows<00:02:19.890> well<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.640> hands<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.120> different

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
it flows well you get hands at different

it flows well you get hands at different
angles<00:02:21.810> you're<00:02:22.170> punching<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
angles you're punching it out so you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.100 
angles you're punching it out so you
want<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.549> start<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.940> straight<00:02:24.269> straight

movement<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.530> c14<00:03:09.340> puncher<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.060> move

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
movement so c14 puncher in it you move

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.460 
movement so c14 puncher in it you move
back<00:03:10.570> move<00:03:10.810> away<00:03:10.990> get<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:12.070> dice<00:03:12.790> man<00:03:14.640> shots
