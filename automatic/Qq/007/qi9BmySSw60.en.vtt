 well, at least calm calm 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 my soul just does not want 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.720
 see there the brotherly people were like that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.929
 incomprehensible 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.450
 wallowed war here 21 year hope that 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.369
 i'm a twenty first century so we even 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.979
 here the words to the unspeakable are sure that 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.950
 its just that we just don't want to be 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.810
 and all this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.360
 not war but you will see more such 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.030
 here's a standoff so that's all 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.280
 passed peacefully out and faded away because 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.500
 that this is all the same but the 21st century let's 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 let's live a normal human life 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 short 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.140
 let's not do it yet 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.149
 Pike carousel tell how your 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
 Crimea view in the sports plan 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.509
 promising promising region in 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.880
 the future of this 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.950
 and in the past there was always something here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.549
 a lot of sports bases were and 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.289
 and in football you are not this filth to us 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.119
 come to train that is, we are very 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.850
 associated with the Crimea that is how would we 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.990
 it turns out the actor is pressed constantly here 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.110
 not even leisure leisure friends who have n't 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.899
 everything is so tied here that everything 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.769
 going on here 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.480
 it sounds there because 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.950
 relatives and close friends and all 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.959
 rest here this very moment is not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.140
 not the most pleasant to anyone like that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.209
 wish you said he visited 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 some sports nursery up base 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.200
 which grew you combine together with 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.670
 these people with coaches and so have 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.380
 I again say my mother grew up together 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.450
 with them so she has a lot of friends 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:43.120
 mates keep the mood can be 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.760
 listen to the sports community of Crimea 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.459
 well, at least they are not all that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.829
 holiday so I can say so for 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.579
 it 's nice to me just stupid 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.989
 human support people just 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.090
 play with them in 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.709
 tennis chat there with adults 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.959
 guys than war is also absolutely 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.269
 ok no not so funny no 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.099
 How important is development in my opinion? 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.930
 children's sports are not all of course children 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.910
 become famous athletes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.110
 athletes note definitely create 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.840
 conditions are necessary 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.450
 necessarily in 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.269
 that is, the potential is the greatest 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.280
 more weather shako lets you play on 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.830
 outdoors a lot more time 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.910
 than we live in 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.540
 In Moscow, then the prospects are gorgeous 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.330
 territory again in football tennis 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.960
 most often chess is anything 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.210
 here I can naturally many not 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.240
 I will not be there stars but at least 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.880
 there will be a chance there is a chance for a healthy way 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.350
 of life 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.980
 now we have this situation probably not 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.570
 only we are not talking about Crimea marriage 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.490
 Russian athletes many of them 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.700
 gets to places where are held 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.620
 competitions often for their money 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940
 some even occupy both here in 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.030
 Russian Federation similar questions 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.250
 dare don't listen have we have 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.930
 the rule is the program you are federation 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.209
 would rather wear out russian tennis 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:18.109
 we have a kind of subsidy there 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:20.660
 We have all the covenant that brings on 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.820
 line on line mission for the sport we have 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.350
 there is a program certain blue already 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.980
 there is 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.510
 there is and the situation is improving and how would she 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.640
 doesn't move in the right board to 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.100
 The tendency is visible that I will find bercy there 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.720
 where it is necessary and therefore the sport develops on 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.470
 5 see what happens there 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.840
 hockey as from nkk built with fetishov 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.520
 that is to say, very seriously, I spend 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.130
 left postal product but what 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.870
 Russia has traditionally been a product 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.400
 the product was intermediates now its 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.420
 combed he looks like och on it already 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.090
 more serious 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.040
 on us scale well of course it's just 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.650
 need to 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.280
 we have lost quite a lot of time 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.240
 generations that since the 90s 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.160

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.590
 starts to pair up that is trends 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.890

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.080

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.750
 programs 50 2 fok each fock 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.690
