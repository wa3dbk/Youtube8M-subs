we<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:05.100> reached<00:00:05.370> an<00:00:05.609> inflection<00:00:06.150> point<00:00:06.180> in

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
we have reached an inflection point in

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.870 
we have reached an inflection point in
technology<00:00:07.200> where<00:00:07.620> we're<00:00:07.980> not<00:00:08.130> even<00:00:08.309> debating

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
technology where we're not even debating

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.970 
technology where we're not even debating
the<00:00:09.000> merits<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.599> cloud<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.139> what<00:00:10.410> what<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the merits of the cloud or what what the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.919 
the merits of the cloud or what what the
next<00:00:11.160> big<00:00:11.550> things<00:00:11.820> there<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.540> there's

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
next big things there is there's

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.340 
next big things there is there's
obviously<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:15.059> famous<00:00:15.420> s-curve<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
obviously and the famous s-curve of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
obviously and the famous s-curve of
innovation<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.310> jumped<00:00:17.699> already<00:00:17.850> from

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
innovation and we jumped already from

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
innovation and we jumped already from
one<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.020> referring<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> platforms<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
one that was referring to platforms and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
one that was referring to platforms and

market<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.600> think<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> shift<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.829> you'll

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
market I think there's a shift if you'll

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
market I think there's a shift if you'll
also<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> instead<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.270> moving<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
also see that instead of moving the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260 
also see that instead of moving the
market<00:00:49.860> data<00:00:50.010> toward<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> processing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
be globally distributed there will be a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320 
be globally distributed there will be a
lot<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.360> data<00:01:18.570> movement<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> probably

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
lot of data movement and probably

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.020 
lot of data movement and probably
leveraging<00:01:22.170> cloud<00:01:22.380> services<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:23.400> ship<00:01:23.850> the

processing will happen and the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
processing will happen and the

processing itself will shift where the

to deal with a big data problem because
that's<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> biggest<00:01:37.229> challenges<00:01:37.710> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that's one of the biggest challenges we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.690 
that's one of the biggest challenges we
face<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.729> move<00:01:39.030> over

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
face it's how we move over

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.510 
face it's how we move over
around<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.710> networks<00:01:41.710> never<00:01:42.070> seem<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.490> be
