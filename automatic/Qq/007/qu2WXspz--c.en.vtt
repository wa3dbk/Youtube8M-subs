then booty wiggle it back the rest of
the<00:02:12.330> way<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.690> method<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> clunky<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.160> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the way this method is clunky but it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
the way this method is clunky but it
does<00:02:14.610> work<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> smoothest<00:02:15.840> most

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

making mountain is a hoop path term
comes<00:02:36.300> from<00:02:36.390> Baxter<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.140> idea<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.830> if

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
comes from Baxter the idea is that if

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.550 
comes from Baxter the idea is that if
you<00:02:38.400> widen<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.120> base<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.870> hoop<00:02:40.020> wants<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.440> go

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you widen the base the hoop wants to go

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
you widen the base the hoop wants to go
up<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> narrowest<00:02:41.700> point<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.450> technique

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
up to the narrowest point this technique

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.540 
up to the narrowest point this technique
is<00:02:43.020> most<00:02:43.170> helpful<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.710> you've<00:02:43.860> mastered<00:02:44.130> the

is most helpful if you've mastered the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.760 
is most helpful if you've mastered the
drumming<00:02:45.000> technique<00:02:45.360> or<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:45.960> you've<00:02:46.140> done<00:02:46.590> the

started to notice where it lands on your
leg<00:02:51.420> basically<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.470> control<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.860> have

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
leg basically the more control you have

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.490 
leg basically the more control you have
over<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.550> leg<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.120> effective<00:02:55.020> making

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
over your leg the more effective making

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320 
over your leg the more effective making
mountain<00:02:55.800> will<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.580> use<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.000> making

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
mountain will be so to use the making

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.820 
mountain will be so to use the making
Mountain<00:02:57.660> technique<00:02:58.050> you're<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.709> to

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
Mountain technique you're going to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.310 
Mountain technique you're going to
slowly<00:02:59.280> spread<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.209> legs<00:03:00.420> wider<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.290> wider

and as you spread your legs but hoop is
going<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.780> want<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.080> go<00:03:04.530> up<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> narrower

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
going to want to go up to the narrower

pretty close to booty wiggle range so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.720 
pretty close to booty wiggle range so
you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.410> go<00:03:13.530> ahead<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.920> booty<00:03:14.280> wiggle<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.640> the

you can go ahead and booty wiggle it the
rest<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> way<00:03:15.270> but<00:03:15.600> keep<00:03:15.780> trying<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
rest of the way but keep trying the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.420 
rest of the way but keep trying the
mountain<00:03:16.440> technique<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.070> see<00:03:17.220> how<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
mountain technique just to see how it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.770 
mountain technique just to see how it
feels<00:03:17.610> it'll<00:03:18.000> only<00:03:18.150> make<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> better

hooper technique 3 it's a little bit
crazy<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.390> learned<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.780> one<00:03:21.989> from<00:03:22.050> revolver

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
crazy I learned this one from revolver

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.560 
crazy I learned this one from revolver
several<00:03:23.310> years<00:03:23.520> ago<00:03:23.670> if<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.060> don't<00:03:24.300> know<00:03:24.420> who

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
several years ago if you don't know who

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.660 
several years ago if you don't know who
revolver<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.590> should<00:03:25.890> check<00:03:26.250> her<00:03:26.430> how

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
revolver is you should check her how

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.770 
revolver is you should check her how
she's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
she's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.170 
she's
the<00:03:28.530> key<00:03:28.709> concept<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.550> technique<00:03:29.970> is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
the key concept with this technique is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
the key concept with this technique is
you<00:03:30.360> lock<00:03:30.720> your<00:03:30.930> knees<00:03:31.110> though<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:31.830> aren't

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
knees are locked and it works and it's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.180 
knees are locked and it works and it's
weird<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.930> those<00:04:13.319> are<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> three<00:04:13.830> techniques

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
weird so those are the three techniques

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.970 
weird so those are the three techniques
but<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.610> did<00:04:14.850> promise<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.600> cheap<00:04:16.049> 15<00:04:16.799> will

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
but I did promise you a cheap 15 will

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.740 
but I did promise you a cheap 15 will
require<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.970> back<00:04:18.209> lift<00:04:18.510> down
