00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.520
 in this video I will explain the list of 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.029
 supplies for the restaurant that comes 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.490
 as an extra bonus in this product 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.009
 we have already done the work we of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.750
 Make a detailed list of everything 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.539
 what you will need in your 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.199
 restaurant now how are we talking 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.900
 from about 600 to 700 inputs and 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.970
 only in some type of condiments 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.670
 could you for example in the case of 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.549
 Arab food have about 100 or 200 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.070
 small seasonings your list goes to 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.780
 vary and can enrich it in the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.269
 as they get new 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.850
 suppliers and also to the extent 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.430
 We prepare new dishes 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.530
 we have here the basics so that you do not 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.369
 lose and do not have a lot of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.250
 tremendous things we have first the 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:03.920
 supplies for food this list is going 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.040
 to use the list very consistently 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.189
 of supplies for food and tells us 5 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.780
 columns the first column of the product 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.000
 What I need 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.470
 the second column the amount that 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.509
 I need third place the brand that is 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.590
 the preference of us 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.720
 the provider in fourth place and the notes 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 good let's start with the part of 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.000
 product is important when 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.729
 mention the product you can say by 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.759
 example pork meat packed in kilo 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.350
 you have to be very specific in cooking with 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.080
 what is the product that we 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.020
 we want and how we want to cut a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.390
 example would be the fillets of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.179
 fish we want them in steak we want 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 in posts we want sliced as 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.659
 we want the fishmonger cut our 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.759
 fish steak 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.549
 once we have put the product 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.579
 let's put the amount one kilo 2 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.149
 kilos 20 slices 30 slices like 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.069
 we prefer because remember that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.370
 to the extent that you know the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.819
 amounts will know how to do their costs 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 it is not the same to say a bottle of 20 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.239
 ounces than a 700 milliliter bottle 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.180
 because it will be a different form of 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.000
 afford if I pay per ounce 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.340
 and it will be easier than paying for 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.939
 milliliters but that you decided if 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.489
 I pay for slice of fish is more 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.920
 easy to afford per kilo then 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.150
 be very careful because that is going to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 impact on the cost of each of the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.489
 things that you will need as input 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.500
 good secondly what is the brand 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.889
 that I want if there is no brand not 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.599
 we put nothing in the provider if he was going to 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.000
 be where you are going to buy 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.389
 it might be with the fishmonger 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.220
 in the store such or such phone 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.099
 we are going to consolidate 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.579
 our suppliers as I commented inside 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.780
 of the theoretical part of the course is 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.400
 extremely important that our 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.700
 provider 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.010
 Well, we like most things 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.860
 possible because otherwise you are going 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.049
 to have 15 20 30 suppliers and it's 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.260
 impossible many times 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.379
 you have with so much provider and then the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.420
 notes remember that the posts have to 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.510
 go so many centimeters and you have to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.909
 remove the skin from fish for example 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.250
 then it is very specific especially in 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.760
 supplies for food because that's what 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.920
 to depend on how they bring us chicken 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.650
 type of chicken if it's organic if it's not 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.959
 organic to whom you are going to buy and from 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
 otherwise it's going to change the recipe and it's going 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.519
 to change the flavor and to whom they restore 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.970
 things are truly scientific 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.739
 Well we told you that I think this 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.280
 applies to not only for meats and 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.250
 salchichonerÃ­a but also for fish 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.670
 seafood the vegetables themselves the cheese and 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.030
 dairy since they are already refrigerated 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.530
 and here we have bakery and pastry and 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.660
 well there we are going to create in this 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.230
 moment to see I want to tell you what 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.230
 following 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.040
 and
