00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.690 
Youth your ox 97 actually is topped with
this<00:03:04.060> deck<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:05.170> clearly<00:03:05.739> down<00:03:06.280> but<00:03:06.580> not

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
this deck so it's clearly down but not

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.930 
this deck so it's clearly down but not
out

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
out

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.970 
out
and<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.360> last<00:03:07.540> deck<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.050> photon<00:03:08.410> galaxy

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
and the last deck is the photon galaxy

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.830 
and the last deck is the photon galaxy
deck<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.940> really<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.300> what<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.540> call<00:03:10.660> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
deck I don't really know what to call it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 
deck I don't really know what to call it
but<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.980> deck<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.310> summons<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.940> big

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
but is the deck that summons the big

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.170 
but is the deck that summons the big
dragon<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.840> eggsy's<00:03:14.800> summons<00:03:15.160> rank<00:03:15.970> eights

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
dragon and eggsy's summons rank eights

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.289 
dragon and eggsy's summons rank eights
really<00:03:16.989> easily<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.459> would<00:03:18.730> say<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.180> is

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
really easily so I would say that is

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.729 
really easily so I would say that is
probably<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> newer<00:03:20.140> decks<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.590> has

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
probably one of the newer decks that has

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.740 
probably one of the newer decks that has
a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:20.950> untapped<00:03:21.190> potential<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> seems

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
a lot of untapped potential and it seems

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.600 
a lot of untapped potential and it seems
to<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:22.900> go<00:03:23.140> unnoticed<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.769> all<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
to just go unnoticed because all of the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.460 
to just go unnoticed because all of the
support<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.120> actually<00:03:25.360> really<00:03:25.900> easy<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.320> get

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
support is actually really easy to get

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.470 
support is actually really easy to get
and<00:03:26.709> those<00:03:26.890> are<00:03:27.070> 10<00:03:27.310> decks<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.299> try

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
and those are 10 decks that you can try

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.970 
and those are 10 decks that you can try
out<00:03:28.630> if<00:03:28.810> you're<00:03:28.959> sick<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.350> tired<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.830> playing

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
out if you're sick and tired of playing

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.830 
out if you're sick and tired of playing
the<00:03:30.190> same<00:03:30.370> old<00:03:30.549> thing<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.630> concludes

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the same old thing so that concludes

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.140 
the same old thing so that concludes
