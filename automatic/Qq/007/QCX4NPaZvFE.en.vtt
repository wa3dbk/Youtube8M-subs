00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.930
 life 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.600
 how about friends of the dotcom greenway 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.290
 thank you for being here today 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.930
 has announced that on December 2 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.920
 past of 2012 a few months ago there was a 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.910
 encounter between a plane with 220 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.900
 passengers and the ctera part of the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.270
 crew where there was an almost crash 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.780
 with an unidentified object that was not 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.760
 detected on the radar this was up in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.820
 the skies of scotland and the pilot was 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.809
 impressed of almost almost accident 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.010
 shock that they had so was the impact 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.290
 who insisted on generating a report but 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.899
 this one had to be undone in view of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.720
 that was not detected on radar in view of 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.390
 which, as in many other cases, was such 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.300
 the speed that passengers could not 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 see the object only the pilot and the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.450
 co-pilot could be witnesses and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 interviewed separately 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 They could see exactly the same 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.509
 data in some way giving you truthfulness 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 to this matter but this was undone 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.819
 case this report will not prosper nor 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.130
 it will even remain as a report or as 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.619
 a report that was just like another 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.140
 case more reminds me a lot to the case 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 Spanish perhaps you tell me and many others 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 cases in which it has been reported that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.649
 it is not to bury but that the passengers 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.520
 or the pilots themselves can visualize 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.179
 an object that comes very fast and with 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.860
 a closeness almost of shock and others the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.470
 cases like this one that you mentioned in the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.739
 case of manises had the luck of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.380
 that at the insistence of the pilot 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.500
 send me a military inject which could 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.480
 corroborate this object followed it by 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.530
 almost the entire peninsula of Spain 'and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.230
 they could somehow 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.030
 you can find more information 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.910
 in a report that was actually made 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.640
 public and is one of the best known in 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.770
 Spain good for now 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.170
 of metric this link and I'll give you something else 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.620
 of information from this case and we will be 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.780
 good practicing other testimonials 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.890
 that tell us about close encounters 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.520
 with ships manned aircraft or 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.520
 civilians
