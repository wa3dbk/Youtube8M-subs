 that was a hard piece of work it is rather 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.079
 what will be transferred from the internet z530 what happened 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.210
 and one day said that can build more process itself 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.440
 BÃ¶rsianer must complain you assume that us otherwise device itself 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.300
 around 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.970

 then you can check blood flow and wifi on tenders here and that has 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.150
 Evening a switch 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.660
 then we have a few more in advance 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.980
 some things like a ball 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.650
 controls 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 once we have such a button with which we have the various competitions 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.440
 can switch on and off what is initially interesting as you see 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.170
 how the product side worked at what angle the attached that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.570
 mean that others hold the device like that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.060
 there she is still surrounded by the 15 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.000

 blatantly had trouble 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 and then it will be whether the balkan-countries Windows 7 Home Premium is one 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 Capacitive times there are few could see 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.410
 who really reacts very well 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.490

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.959
 that he is heavy 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.159
 therefore fall here in the front 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.999
 Christian Sandrock Hans j 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.889
 then we should support a way that probably would

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.969
 more or less dust on the shelves
