I think about $6 for each pack which is
kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.950> pricey<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.490> then<00:00:53.640> again<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.970> might

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
kind of pricey but then again it might

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.790 
kind of pricey but then again it might
not<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.720> when<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.320> arrive<00:00:55.560> in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
symbol of what kind of animal they are a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.030 
symbol of what kind of animal they are a
dice<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.330> some<00:02:59.510> reason<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.350> number<00:03:00.709> oh<00:03:00.830> this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
dice for some reason the number oh this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.530 
dice for some reason the number oh this
is<00:03:01.160> number<00:03:01.370> 99<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.150> means<00:03:02.330> there's<00:03:02.480> only

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
is number 99 which means there's only

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
is number 99 which means there's only
one<00:03:02.690> more<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.650> first<00:03:03.860> series<00:03:04.100> because

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
one more in the first series because

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.650 
one more in the first series because
like<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.940> said<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.150> think<00:03:05.240> there<00:03:05.450> are<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> hundred

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
like I said I think there are a hundred

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.449 
like I said I think there are a hundred
and<00:03:05.990> then<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.560> guess<00:03:06.740> these<00:03:06.920> little<00:03:07.190> things<00:03:07.370> are

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
and then I guess these little things are

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.530 
and then I guess these little things are
just<00:03:07.610> like<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.940> wanted<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.270> play<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> game

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
just like if you wanted to play a game

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.730 
just like if you wanted to play a game
with<00:03:08.930> them<00:03:09.050> like<00:03:09.170> if<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.350> want<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> play

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
with them like if you want to play

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.410 
with them like if you want to play
rock-paper-scissors<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.910> your<00:03:11.030> animal

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
rock-paper-scissors with your animal

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.630 
rock-paper-scissors with your animal
crossing<00:03:11.750> cars<00:03:11.959> or<00:03:12.260> some<00:03:12.950> sort<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.160> dice<00:03:13.370> game

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
crossing cars or some sort of dice game

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.980 
crossing cars or some sort of dice game
you<00:03:13.790> could<00:03:13.940> do<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.390> think<00:03:14.660> that's<00:03:14.840> what

you could do that I think that's what
it's<00:03:15.110> for

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it's for

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.850

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
think that's cube but he used to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
think that's cube but he used to
actually<00:03:21.050> have<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> Gamecube<00:03:22.130> shirt<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.670> oh

Animal<00:03:51.080> Crossing<00:03:51.170> games<00:03:51.680> as<00:03:51.890> well<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.430> think<00:03:52.790> I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
Animal Crossing games as well I think I

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.900

think<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:54.739> also<00:03:54.860> use<00:03:55.070> these<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.580> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
think you can also use these in the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.850 
think you can also use these in the
upcoming<00:03:56.300> game<00:03:56.600> Animal<00:03:57.500> Crossing<00:03:57.560> amiibo

probably<00:04:00.620> work<00:04:00.769> in<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.400> mainstream<00:04:02.180> Animal

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
probably work in a mainstream Animal

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.690 
probably work in a mainstream Animal
Crossing<00:04:03.110> game<00:04:03.560> whenever<00:04:03.950> we<00:04:04.100> get<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.430> I'm
