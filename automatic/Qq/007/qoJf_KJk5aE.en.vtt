burner put your alcohol inside once you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.240 
burner put your alcohol inside once you
get<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.500> close<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> Tim<00:01:13.860> back<00:01:14.040> up

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
get that in there close the Tim back up

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
get that in there close the Tim back up
prom<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.480> alcohol<00:01:15.600> outside<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:16.710> then

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
prom it with an alcohol outside and then

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.940 
prom it with an alcohol outside and then
a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.870> it<00:01:18.870> should<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.230> it<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.590> 20

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a lot it and it should take it about 20

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.050 
a lot it and it should take it about 20
seconds<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.940> prom<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.690> then<00:01:21.870> we'll<00:01:21.990> blossom

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
seconds to prom and then we'll blossom

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.830 
seconds to prom and then we'll blossom
one<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.050> speed<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
one way I think I can speed up see it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
one way I think I can speed up see it
prominent<00:01:27.840> part<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.190> wrap<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> bottom

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
prominent part is to wrap the bottom

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
prominent part is to wrap the bottom
with<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> little<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.020> probably<00:01:31.830> less

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
with a little bit of a probably less

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.040 
with a little bit of a probably less
wick<00:01:32.160> just<00:01:32.540> soaked<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:33.900> extra

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
wick just soaked up a little extra

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.320 
wick just soaked up a little extra
alcohol<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> priming<00:01:35.220> process<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.820> couple

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
alcohol for the priming process a couple

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.200 
alcohol for the priming process a couple
of<00:01:36.510> times<00:01:36.660> I've<00:01:36.840> had<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.610> prime<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> twice<00:01:38.940> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
of times I've had to prime it twice to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
of times I've had to prime it twice to
get<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.290> most<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.620> time

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
get it really going but most of the time

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.400 
get it really going but most of the time
it<00:01:40.830> just<00:01:40.860> takes<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.340> um<00:01:42.170> doesn't<00:01:43.170> weigh

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
it just takes one um doesn't weigh

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.840 
it just takes one um doesn't weigh
really<00:01:43.800> anything<00:01:44.190> it's<00:01:44.370> really<00:01:44.610> super

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
really anything it's really super

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.540 
really anything it's really super
lightweight<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:48.050> really<00:01:49.050> small<00:01:49.320> stove<00:01:49.740> has

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
a little extra surface area to it works

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.030 
a little extra surface area to it works
really<00:01:54.150> good<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.660> 32<00:01:55.080> ounce<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.410> pot<00:01:55.560> and

just kind of prime around it and this is
the<00:03:43.200> part<00:03:43.410> where<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> think<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.890> wick<00:03:44.070> would<00:03:44.220> come

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the part where I think a wick would come

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.780 
the part where I think a wick would come
in<00:03:44.460> handy<00:03:44.550> with<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.970> line<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.570> up<00:03:46.550> let<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.670> burn

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
in handy with it line it up let it burn

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.310 
in handy with it line it up let it burn
like<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> said<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> couple<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> times<00:03:48.930> I've<00:03:49.290> had

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
like I said a couple of times I've had

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.790 
like I said a couple of times I've had
it<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.730> lot<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.120> not<00:03:51.240> prom<00:03:51.600> immediately<00:03:54.770> but<00:03:55.770> I

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
it a lot and not prom immediately but I

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.500 
it a lot and not prom immediately but I
was<00:03:55.950> like<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.670> said<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.330> one

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
was like like I said I think that one

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.660 
was like like I said I think that one
that<00:03:58.320> would<00:03:58.440> problem<00:03:58.860> would<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.100> alleviated

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
that would problem would be alleviated

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.920 
that would problem would be alleviated
if<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.880> just<00:04:00.060> put<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.210> little<00:04:00.330> wick<00:04:00.510> underneath

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
if I just put a little wick underneath

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.800 
if I just put a little wick underneath
it<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.890> see<00:04:02.130> probably<00:04:02.480> right<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:03.630> it's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
it you can see probably right now it's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.700 
it you can see probably right now it's
going<00:04:03.960> to<00:04:04.020> have<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.410> little<00:04:04.590> more

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
prominent so we're going to get going
there<00:04:11.120> now<00:04:12.120> prom<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.750> time

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.170 

so<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:34.480> going<00:04:34.720> now

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.090 

chill<00:04:40.840> I'm<00:04:40.990> using<00:04:41.199> right<00:04:41.440> now<00:04:41.470> is<00:04:41.620> danger

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.700 
chill I'm using right now is danger
alcohol<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.729> didn't<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.090> any<00:04:43.240> heat<00:04:43.710> brand

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
alcohol I didn't have any heat brand

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.240 
alcohol I didn't have any heat brand
alcohol<00:04:45.669> on<00:04:45.910> hand<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:47.080> stuff<00:04:47.350> sometimes

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
alcohol on hand and this stuff sometimes

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.189 
alcohol on hand and this stuff sometimes
it<00:04:48.340> burns<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.699> little<00:04:48.729> weird<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.360> little<00:04:49.900> yellow

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
it burns a little weird a little yellow

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.409 
it burns a little weird a little yellow
flame<00:04:50.500> out<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.979> when<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:51.970> burn<00:04:52.180> heat

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
flame out of it when you burn heat

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.960 
flame out of it when you burn heat
through<00:04:52.660> this<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.259> burns<00:04:54.009> blue<00:04:54.340> all<00:04:54.910> the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
through this is a burns blue all the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.749 
through this is a burns blue all the
time<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.500> think<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.340> probably<00:04:57.520> the

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
time so I think it's probably the

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.180 
time so I think it's probably the
additive<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.870> denatured<00:04:59.289> alcohol<00:04:59.410> that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
additive in the denatured alcohol that

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.930 
additive in the denatured alcohol that
they<00:05:01.030> put<00:05:01.240> in<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.630> make<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.810> undrinkable

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
they put in it to make it undrinkable

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.110 
they put in it to make it undrinkable
that<00:05:03.940> makes<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.300> run<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.660> little<00:05:04.810> bit<00:05:05.110> yellow

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
that makes it run a little bit yellow

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.100 
that makes it run a little bit yellow
because<00:05:07.120> there's<00:05:07.270> nothing<00:05:07.449> else<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.930> den

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
because there's nothing else in the den

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.050 
because there's nothing else in the den
that<00:05:08.320> would<00:05:08.440> burn<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:09.009> different<00:05:09.610> color<00:05:09.820> so

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
that would burn a different color so

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.050 
that would burn a different color so
