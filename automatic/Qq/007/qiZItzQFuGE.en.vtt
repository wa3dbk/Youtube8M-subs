next we're on this D shape again with
the<00:01:50.420> root<00:01:50.600> note<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.050> F<00:01:51.170> sharp<00:01:51.200> i<00:01:52.840> say<00:01:53.840> f

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the root note on the F sharp i say f

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.230 
the root note on the F sharp i say f
sharp<00:01:54.200> even<00:01:54.410> though<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.740> G<00:01:55.190> sharp<00:01:55.460> I'm

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.699 

next<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:06.920> email<00:03:07.159> in<00:03:07.489> shape<00:03:07.700> again<00:03:08.709> but

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
next to that email in shape again but

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.800 
next to that email in shape again but
this<00:03:09.830> time<00:03:10.129> we<00:03:10.700> start<00:03:11.030> off<00:03:11.120> with<00:03:11.360> an<00:03:11.480> open

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
this time we start off with an open

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.720 
this time we start off with an open
first<00:03:12.080> second

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.250 

okay<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:15.959> we<00:03:16.050> play<00:03:16.430> six<00:03:18.800> three<00:03:19.800> two<00:03:19.980> more

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.010 

so<00:03:31.320> it's<00:03:31.850> one<00:03:32.850> two<00:03:33.740> six<00:03:34.740> missing<00:03:35.730> one

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
so how about fits in with the previous D

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.149 
so how about fits in with the previous D
shape

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.770
