 new varieties these new varieties require 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.550
 completely and new in cold and more 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040

 betrayed by some sort of a new 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 attention is paid to this in the philodendron 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.790
 that he has not disappeared because you are very 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.579
 many calls 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.890
 it is about new products here we take 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 this l1 drone 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 very rare variety even true in our 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.910
 Transnistria few have this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.739
 plants and even those who purchased them 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.460
 called repeatedly to help save it 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 plant 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 I have your time with great difficulty on 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 saved why most often philodendron 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.790
 sale is coming 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 This wet ground is already on experience 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.630
 I know that there has never been such a thing 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.650
 that brought the philodendron for me was 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 dry wet ground and if you are so yourself 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.600
 decided to purchase pay attention 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 the earth is wet and go away 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.110
 go through the week 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.619
 note again if you are 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.110
 noticed dark spots on the leaves better 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 do not acquire a plant 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.579
 because for 1 week leaves 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 darker more and more you don't even 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.759
 have time to save him and how he turns black and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.860
 you throw it away 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.290
 but if he did appear in your 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.049
 home in such a condition first 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.049
 urgent need to change the ground 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.299
 try to remove the top layer of earth 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.430
 shake a little at the edges put in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 dry soil do not water a couple of weeks 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 find the brightest warm place to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.700
 the ground dried out quickly 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.030
 and then water the plant very 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.560
 rarely somewhere two times are enough 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.310
 legs 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.890
 in winter you can even rarer body de drone 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.959
 depending on the color like different 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.300
 locations of such places and leaves 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.760
 variegated happens such a sort learn gist 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 round with this salad is so dark 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.019
 green veined on these varieties they 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.380
 very demanding of light put 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.010
 as close as possible to the light where we even 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.709
 you can keep them on the windowsills heat 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 battery che and need to benefit go 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.200
 dry air special lay person 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.950
 philodendron does not render philodendron 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 it requires support you can such a support or 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 tobacco let him such an interesting buckle 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.670
 if you don't want lavender 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.980
 drone very quickly grew these 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 after all, and here are the long shoots you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.819
 just let it grow up opportunities 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.400
 shone big big and trim or 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.450
 same here in this support insert the other 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.540
 The prop of one drone often bloom but 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.410
 most often in greenhouses apartment 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.290
 identify and wait for flowering than good 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.810
 this plant is first possible 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.160
 plant on any other plants in one 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.640
 pot can be planted 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.799
 1 philodendron climbing near yet 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.640
 some plant especially 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.859
 for offices for large rooms and you 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.030
 Cares will look very impressive 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.160
 such composition 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.069
 But when selecting, consider that in one pot 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.380
 must grow plants with the same care 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.389
 whether you need a carbide plant 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.239
 know kladin drone grow very fast 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.420
 they do not have to be fed but if 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.760
 really want to dissolve the cap is not 2 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.250
 liters of water and a cap of 3 liters of water and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.340
 water it only speed up and and was 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.810
 growth besides scarlet defended one drones 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.569
 there are still such small compact ones 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.150
 plants can be in their compositions 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.209
 use for with possible gilligan their 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.950
 there are non-metallic coasters and such 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.060
 small compact plants that like 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.730

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.069
 as if the tattered paper see beautiful 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.170
 spring sheet is completely moisture-free 1 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.049
 not need this plant wide 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.799
 pot as this philodendron lets 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.959

 do you want flowers to grow at home 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.620
 pay attention to the trunk foliage 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 if you know such a trunk, Mrs. you are fat 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.680
 if dense means the plant is not 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.930
 loves moisture 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.550
 if you take it into account with you 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.669
