night vision capabilities and it uses a

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.810 
night vision capabilities and it uses a
feature<00:01:13.479> called<00:01:13.810> night<00:01:14.320> shot<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:15.040> this<00:01:15.610> night

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
feature called night shot and this night

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.000 
feature called night shot and this night
shot<00:01:16.090> will<00:01:16.390> allow<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.020> use<00:01:17.440> infrared

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
shot will allow you to use infrared

it<00:01:22.570> seems<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.080> Sony<00:01:23.380> has<00:01:23.620> actually

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
it seems that Sony has actually

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.069 
it seems that Sony has actually
discontinued<00:01:24.760> most<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.479> its<00:01:25.600> night<00:01:25.840> shot

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
discontinued most of its night shot

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.170 
discontinued most of its night shot

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.080 
not an infrared night vision feature
then<00:02:07.179> we<00:02:07.270> use<00:02:07.450> terms<00:02:07.899> such<00:02:08.110> as<00:02:08.310> low<00:02:09.310> lux<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
then we use terms such as low lux and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.470 
then we use terms such as low lux and
all<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.960> us<00:02:11.200> means<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.680> low<00:02:12.040> light<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:13.090> does<00:02:13.300> not

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
all of us means is low light it does not

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
all of us means is low light it does not

now<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.510> we<00:02:28.600> know<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.750> little<00:02:29.050> bit<00:02:29.230> about<00:02:29.500> what

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
now that we know a little bit about what

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.040 
now that we know a little bit about what
to<00:02:29.800> look<00:02:29.950> for<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.730> night-vision<00:02:30.940> camera

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to look for in a night-vision camera

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.880 
to look for in a night-vision camera
we're<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> talk<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> little<00:02:32.530> bit<00:02:32.680> about

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.800 
we're going to talk a little bit about
the<00:02:33.040> infrared<00:02:33.430> light<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:34.240> light<00:02:34.420> I'm<00:02:34.600> showing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the infrared light the light I'm showing

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.490 
the infrared light the light I'm showing
you<00:02:34.900> here

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
you here

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.190 
you here
is<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.770> SEMA<00:02:36.040> SL<00:02:36.580> 20<00:02:36.970> IR<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.960> great

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
is the SEMA SL 20 IR it's a great

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.950 
is the SEMA SL 20 IR it's a great
infrared<00:02:38.680> light<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.190> very<00:02:39.610> very<00:02:39.940> bright<00:02:40.240> now

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
infrared light it's very very bright now

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.440 
infrared light it's very very bright now
when<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.170> turn<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.530> light<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.310> look<00:02:43.120> at<00:02:43.300> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
when I turn this light on and look at it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.990 
when I turn this light on and look at it
I<00:02:43.660> don't<00:02:44.560> see<00:02:44.920> anything<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.550> don't<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.820> any

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
I don't see anything I don't see any

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.280 
I don't see anything I don't see any
light<00:02:46.210> at<00:02:46.360> all<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:46.750> when<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.900> turn<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.260> in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
light at all but when I turn it in

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.180 
light at all but when I turn it in
facing<00:02:47.650> towards<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.660> see<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
facing towards you you see that the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
facing towards you you see that the
lights<00:02:51.370> actually<00:02:51.550> on<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.270> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> turn<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
lights actually on I'm going to turn it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.690 
lights actually on I'm going to turn it
off<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.740> see<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> difference<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.370> why

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
off and you see the difference there why

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.570 
off and you see the difference there why
is<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.090> well<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:56.770> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
is this well this is because the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.690 
is this well this is because the
particular<00:02:57.880> camera<00:02:58.270> we<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.540> using<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
particular camera we are using is

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.820 
particular camera we are using is
sensitive<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.910> infrared<00:03:01.180> light<00:03:01.650> well<00:03:02.650> that's

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
sensitive to infrared light well that's

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.350 
sensitive to infrared light well that's
great<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.310> means<00:03:03.520> you<00:03:03.910> can<00:03:04.030> use<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.300> from

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
great that means you can use it from

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.810 
great that means you can use it from
that<00:03:04.510> vision<00:03:04.750> right<00:03:05.080> well<00:03:05.920> not<00:03:06.070> exactly

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
that vision right well not exactly

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.550 
that vision right well not exactly
just<00:03:07.209> because<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:07.690> sensitive<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.290> infrared

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
just because it's sensitive to infrared

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.350 
just because it's sensitive to infrared
light<00:03:08.770> does<00:03:09.250> not<00:03:09.280> mean<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.910> you're<00:03:10.209> going<00:03:10.300> to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
light does not mean that you're going to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.080 
light does not mean that you're going to
be<00:03:10.480> able<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.750> use<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.650> infrared<00:03:12.160> lights<00:03:12.730> as<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
be able to use the infrared lights as a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.479 
be able to use the infrared lights as a
source<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.810> illumination<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.400> gets

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
source of illumination so when it gets

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.010 
source of illumination so when it gets
dark<00:03:15.880> we're<00:03:16.600> going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.780> pull<00:03:16.930> out<00:03:16.989> some

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
dark we're going to pull out some

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.870 
dark we're going to pull out some
infrared<00:03:17.380> lights<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.100> I'm<00:03:18.550> going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.730> show

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
infrared lights and I'm going to show

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.979 
infrared lights and I'm going to show
you<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.090> difference<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> little

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
you the difference with a little

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.699 
you the difference with a little
experiment<00:03:21.840> okay<00:03:22.840> guys<00:03:23.020> here<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.290> are<00:03:23.410> outside

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
experiment okay guys here we are outside

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.670 
experiment okay guys here we are outside
it's<00:03:24.340> pretty<00:03:24.610> dark<00:03:24.850> out<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.270> I'm<00:03:25.780> in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
it's pretty dark out here I'm in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.100 
it's pretty dark out here I'm in
night-shot<00:03:27.400> mode<00:03:27.700> right<00:03:27.910> now<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.989> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
night-shot mode right now this is the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.960 
night-shot mode right now this is the
infrared<00:03:29.470> mode<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.070> I'm<00:03:30.130> using<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.550> built-in

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
infrared mode and I'm using the built-in

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.880 
infrared mode and I'm using the built-in
IR<00:03:31.239> light<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.840> comes<00:03:32.050> on<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.410> Sony<00:03:32.650> night

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890

going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.440> be<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> SEMA<00:03:35.890> SL<00:03:36.310> 20<00:03:36.610> IR<00:03:36.940> I'm<00:03:37.180> going

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
going to be the SEMA SL 20 IR I'm going

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.990 
going to be the SEMA SL 20 IR I'm going
to<00:03:37.420> turn<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:37.690> on<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.080> second<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:39.000> you're

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
to turn this on for a second and you're

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.940 
to turn this on for a second and you're
going<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.180> notice<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.570> it's<00:03:40.870> really<00:03:41.650> bright

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
going to notice that it's really bright

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.910 
going to notice that it's really bright
and<00:03:42.760> if<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.390> shot<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.720> myself<00:03:43.930> I'm<00:03:44.620> really

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
and if I shot it on myself I'm really

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.320 
and if I shot it on myself I'm really
bright<00:03:45.130> as<00:03:45.280> well<00:03:45.430> if<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.760> want<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.000> step<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.299> of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
bright as well if I want to step out of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.120 
bright as well if I want to step out of
the<00:03:46.450> way<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.739> actually<00:03:49.590> pretty<00:03:50.590> bright<00:03:50.890> it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the way and actually pretty bright it

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.110 
the way and actually pretty bright it
lights<00:03:51.549> up<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.820> lot<00:03:53.489> okay<00:03:54.489> now<00:03:54.760> what<00:03:54.910> I'm<00:03:55.000> going

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
lights up a lot okay now what I'm going

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.580 
lights up a lot okay now what I'm going
to<00:03:55.150> do<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.390> I'm<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> switch<00:03:55.959> off<00:03:56.170> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
to do is I'm going to switch off the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.840 
to do is I'm going to switch off the
night<00:03:56.739> vision<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.280> we're<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.700> in

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
night vision and we're going to be in

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.690 
night vision and we're going to be in
standard<00:03:58.239> mode<00:03:58.950> okay<00:03:59.950> guys<00:04:00.130> here<00:04:00.400> we<00:04:00.519> are<00:04:00.549> in

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
standard mode okay guys here we are in

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.850 
standard mode okay guys here we are in
the<00:04:01.060> regular<00:04:01.390> operation<00:04:01.930> mode<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> not

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
the regular operation mode this is not

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.199 
the regular operation mode this is not
the<00:04:03.010> night<00:04:03.130> vision<00:04:03.459> mode<00:04:03.610> I'm<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.060> turn

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
the night vision mode I'm going to turn

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.020 
the night vision mode I'm going to turn
the<00:04:04.329> infrared<00:04:04.660> light<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.400> notice<00:04:06.730> that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the infrared light on and notice that

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.569 
the infrared light on and notice that
you<00:04:07.180> kick<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.660> can<00:04:07.900> see<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.350> light<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.160> the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
you kick you can see the light but the

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.000 
you kick you can see the light but the
light's<00:04:09.760> not<00:04:09.970> illuminating<00:04:10.810> anything<00:04:11.200> you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
light's not illuminating anything you

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.979 
light's not illuminating anything you
wouldn't<00:04:12.280> be<00:04:12.370> able<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.579> see<00:04:12.850> anything<00:04:13.090> but<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
wouldn't be able to see anything but the

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.530 
wouldn't be able to see anything but the
light<00:04:14.200> now<00:04:14.620> why<00:04:14.799> is<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:15.250> well<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:16.359> is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
light now why is this well this is

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.020 
light now why is this well this is
because<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.890> not<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.250> infrared<00:04:18.760> mode

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
because this is not the infrared mode

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.020 
because this is not the infrared mode
the<00:04:19.660> camera<00:04:20.079> can<00:04:20.320> see<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.859> light<00:04:21.130> as<00:04:21.459> can

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the camera can see this light as can

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.980 
the camera can see this light as can
most<00:04:22.979> digital<00:04:23.979> still<00:04:24.580> cameras<00:04:25.030> or<00:04:25.270> video

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
most digital still cameras or video

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.230 
most digital still cameras or video
cameras<00:04:26.470> but<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.950> problem<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.940> does<00:04:28.210> not

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
cameras but the problem is it does not

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.150 
cameras but the problem is it does not
have<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.630> capability<00:04:29.169> to<00:04:29.200> use<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.770> light<00:04:29.979> as

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
have the capability to use this light as

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.980 
have the capability to use this light as
illumination<00:04:30.760> I'm<00:04:31.419> going<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.630> actually<00:04:31.840> turn

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
illumination I'm going to actually turn

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.360 
illumination I'm going to actually turn
this<00:04:32.140> light<00:04:32.350> around<00:04:32.680> now<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.070> fish<00:04:33.250> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
this light around now and fish it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.370 
this light around now and fish it
towards<00:04:33.610> myself<00:04:33.729> earlier<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:34.900> could<00:04:35.080> see<00:04:35.229> my

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
towards myself earlier you could see my

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.840 
towards myself earlier you could see my
face<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.890> was<00:04:35.979> really<00:04:36.190> really<00:04:36.400> bright<00:04:36.580> but

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
face it was really really bright but

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.650 
face it was really really bright but
when<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.000> turn<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.270> around<00:04:37.330> now

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
when I turn it around now

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.210 
when I turn it around now
you<00:04:38.320> really<00:04:38.530> can't<00:04:38.680> see<00:04:38.830> much<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.010> anything

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
you really can't see much of anything

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.880 
you really can't see much of anything
and<00:04:39.760> as<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.660> said<00:04:40.720> earlier<00:04:41.169> it<00:04:41.380> doesn't<00:04:41.740> matter

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
and as I said earlier it doesn't matter

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.680 
and as I said earlier it doesn't matter
which<00:04:42.190> mode<00:04:42.460> you're<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:42.910> if<00:04:43.150> you're<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.419> your

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
which mode you're in if you're in your

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.540 
which mode you're in if you're in your
your<00:04:44.470> night<00:04:44.770> mode<00:04:45.130> or<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:46.289> load<00:04:47.289> Lux<00:04:47.710> mode

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
your night mode or your load Lux mode

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.010 
your night mode or your load Lux mode
this<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:48.910> what's<00:04:49.120> going<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.270> happen<00:04:49.690> you're

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
this is what's going to happen you're

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.900 
this is what's going to happen you're
not<00:04:50.050> going<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.560> see<00:04:50.710> anything<00:04:50.950> because<00:04:51.220> it

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
not going to see anything because it

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.610 
not going to see anything because it
cannot<00:04:52.270> use<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.780> infrared<00:04:53.050> light<00:04:53.170> as

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
cannot use the infrared light as

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.650 
cannot use the infrared light as
illumination<00:04:54.280> now<00:04:54.940> we're<00:04:55.120> going<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.270> turn<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
illumination now we're going to turn the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.810 
illumination now we're going to turn the
infrared<00:04:56.140> night<00:04:56.920> vision<00:04:56.950> on<00:04:57.370> one<00:04:57.640> more<00:04:57.760> time

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
infrared night vision on one more time

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.530 
infrared night vision on one more time
to<00:04:58.540> see<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> difference<00:04:59.850> okay<00:05:00.850> we're<00:05:01.180> back<00:05:01.300> in

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
to see the difference okay we're back in

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.210 
to see the difference okay we're back in
the<00:05:01.630> infrared<00:05:02.110> night<00:05:02.350> vision<00:05:02.380> mode<00:05:02.830> I've<00:05:03.070> got

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
the infrared night vision mode I've got

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.950 
the infrared night vision mode I've got
my<00:05:03.340> IR<00:05:03.640> light<00:05:03.820> here<00:05:04.090> as<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.360> could<00:05:04.510> see<00:05:04.720> it's

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
my IR light here as you could see it's

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.310 
my IR light here as you could see it's
illuminating<00:05:05.920> really<00:05:06.370> well<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.230> when<00:05:08.230> we

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
illuminating really well and when we

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.080 
illuminating really well and when we
turn<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.620> off<00:05:08.770> you're<00:05:09.580> going<00:05:09.670> to<00:05:09.730> notice<00:05:09.910> that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
turn it off you're going to notice that

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.600 
turn it off you're going to notice that
it<00:05:10.780> does<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.140> illuminate<00:05:11.530> at<00:05:11.830> all<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.430> can

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
it does not illuminate at all you can

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.360 
it does not illuminate at all you can
only<00:05:12.760> see<00:05:13.150> it<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.140> this<00:05:14.710> is<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.980> difference

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
only see it so this is the difference

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.820 
only see it so this is the difference
between<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.970> camera<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.450> can<00:05:16.600> see<00:05:16.830> infrared

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
between a camera that can see infrared

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.310 
between a camera that can see infrared
light<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.940> camera<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.450> can<00:05:19.630> use<00:05:19.840> infrared

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
light and a camera that can use infrared

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.880 
light and a camera that can use infrared
light<00:05:20.530> as<00:05:20.740> illumination<00:05:22.500> well<00:05:23.500> there<00:05:23.770> you

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
light as illumination well there you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.130 
light as illumination well there you
have<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.370> difference<00:05:24.700> between<00:05:24.820> cameras<00:05:25.540> that

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
have the difference between cameras that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.750 
have the difference between cameras that
are<00:05:26.200> sensitive<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.950> infrared<00:05:27.160> light<00:05:27.370> and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
are sensitive to infrared light and

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.580 
are sensitive to infrared light and
cameras<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.870> have<00:05:28.930> night<00:05:29.290> vision

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
cameras that have night vision

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.620 
cameras that have night vision
capabilities<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.970> can<00:05:31.150> use<00:05:31.390> this

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
capabilities and you can use this

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.050 
capabilities and you can use this
infrared<00:05:31.960> light<00:05:32.260> as<00:05:32.440> illumination<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.250> want<00:05:34.000> to
