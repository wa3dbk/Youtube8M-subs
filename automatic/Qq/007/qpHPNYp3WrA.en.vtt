00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.910
 these dirty scenes for this twelfth tutorial 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.710
 so it's very special it's not 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.500
 really had early seen that I put you a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 download map so why he 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.630
 did not tell me what I did to ya 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.980
 a few months so so it's 0.8 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.080
 point and so this is the small pitch 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.570
 but I echoed it 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.690
 really cared about showed it and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.510
 I take this video to make 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.309
 some news about youtube what 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.090
 is pretty naughty is that look 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.660
 when I go to the search bar 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.350
 google so type how this back I 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.050
 start typing 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.030
 so that's it and I'm lying and at the right 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.540
 moment appears in the bar of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.800
 research 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.539
 so I'm currently at 26.1 bonnier 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.629
 and there in fact I wanted to commemorate 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.420
 this video to put 25 subscribers 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.630
 unfortunately or fortunately that 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.030
 Youtube 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.960
 I had a few minutes ago 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.030
 it was 25 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.549
 I leave you to the video I have not too much 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.760
 the time and there I do it n 26 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.320
 so these are these numbers 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 not very significant but hey that's the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.869
 case it's a quarter of blood it's a 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 this is it and that's it 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.470
 so I am very happy so this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.060
 map 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.770
 I will show you how to download 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.140
 in the second part of this video 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.450
 there I finish my first part in you 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.729
 saying right now so you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.740
 will fall on this link so secret passage 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.689
 download that I will put in the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.439
 description obviously you click on 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.259
 download 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.950
 we expect we choose chrome as 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.110
 this discharge 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070
 it takes a while and it's 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.229
 download you open the application 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.720
 which is called rare so I will put the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.780
 link in the inscription and you press 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.640
 so on secret passage or do we have 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.850
 longer on it and we do 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.899
 extract and 6 it is extracted and you 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.579
 have a record that's going to be going through 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.860
 secret that contains all the 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.530
 information to be able to play too 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.220
 very long on secret passage and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.079
 makes you cut you can see cut 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.180
 copy as if it's like you 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.340
 So I want to try cut you cut 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.440
 have in the games as godfather jean 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.600
 bizet in minecraft wars and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.890
 the collar so that's why you have 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 could hear it anywhere and makes you 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 likely that schools are dexia fact 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.580

 here you will have secret passage that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.140
 appears in chrome team apart in the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.400
 end or beginnings in the middle it depends on the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 game date since I played 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 recently it's good but if you want 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.400

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.440
 weeks will be all saints you will be in 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.380
 the chronological order so you click 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.000
 on it and you have not got enough here then he 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.640
 wrote welcome will come you have passed 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.110

 of cactus good luck so I you 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.750
 wish good luck there and the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.910
 cactus 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 so your goal of the game is to pass 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.390
 all the secret passages 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.820
 it is to thank you to you 25 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.610
 subscriber I tell you a big thank you so 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.459
 you have to find cactus on a bench 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.690
 because to register or go all 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.580
 so I wish you good luck 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.660
 and as soon as you get to the end there 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.180
 will have a word code on the word pass it will be 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.030
 marked finally you have to send a 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.010
 private message on youtube my code so 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.360
 I for example if it is written youtube 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.770
 you send me youtube hang it's the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.780
 private obviously this swimsuit I 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.260
 you would not have tied then the rules 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.269
 it's quite simple prohibition of quasi 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.890
 break chord blocks and we do 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.130
 blunder because twice without doing 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.470
 on purpose we can break blocks sees the 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.350
 second rule 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.030
 good I think it's all here it's 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.750
 all just have a ban on breaking the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.290
 bauxite or so that's the only rule 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.250
 present in this sense this in this in 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.480
 this map 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.519
 then it is possible that you 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.530
 do not appear in this pretty house that 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.150
 I built if you have to test 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.489
 on the other hand you are looking for the tower of 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.890
 cactus and you will find besides a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.669
 treatment with the cactus knows that 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.490
 can do 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.470
 I will show 7.8 a cactus rain 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.510
 look she did not go 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.740
 very big but if you get bored he 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.330
 you do not know what to do every 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.710
 secret passage faults call you without 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.770
 see fart sellars evil absolute 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.819
 Klich 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.400
 so here I wish you good luck 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.289
 for this map and I'll see in a one 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.789
 week or two 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.759
 I will close the contest to see who if 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.050
 she's winning or not or they're 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.759
 the winners et cetera and I will do a 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.349
 little contest so it's a small 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.009
 contest you my subscribers it's for 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.889

 so I hope you enjoy it and 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.280
 it succeeds a lot of matches and rates 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.740
 other things that are not in the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.659
 back and that sometimes uses you 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.150
 may recognize systems 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.460
 other what else youtuber so 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.919
 it's not it's not me who did it all 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.830
 at 100% there are ideas that have not come 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.490
 like that and it's run to a little bit and I 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.380
 I was inspired 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.500
 so here I wish you good luck 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.710
 and see you soon for new tuto bye 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.710
