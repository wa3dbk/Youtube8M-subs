00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hi criminis caesar ocaña ask hello 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.779
 Mr. Daily, would you like me to help 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.360
 next please pass us the link 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.219
 of your video 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.830
 and there would be some problem with the snail 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.809
 little one that I show you in the video 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.849
 apart from him there are like 10 created with 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.500
 little ones I think they are for norvis me 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.599
 They came in new plants that I bought 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.880
 having them with my two snails 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.860
 apple would happen something like I could do 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.930
 food for him had homemade I have 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.730
 world chips would be could make it dust 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.590
 and give my arteries on the back of the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.300
 container says it contains spirulina by 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.040
 last the crab that I show you would have 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.500
 some problem when I grow up with the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.180
 fish would try to eat them or something like that in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.490
 the store had him alone with others 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 fish and normal now I have it three days 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.970
 and normal has not had any problem 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.560
 with the fish with the snails there is no 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.300
 problem in having them together the problem 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.310
 it may come that because the plane orbis 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.290
 make pests and eat the plants 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.450
 You can keep them at bay by removing some 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.130
 few from time to time manually to 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.270
 feed the arteries you're worth with the 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.579
 The boat he has is because he has 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.120
 Spirulina can also give you flours 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.890
 of all kinds seaweed fish food and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.170
 that everything is always well crushed with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 the crab I'm not an expert but I think 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.250
 that you should need an aquarium 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.229
 with half the water in the middle of mud 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.090
 surely in the long run to attack some fish 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.130
 I recommend you get the name 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.740
 I add and look for a tab on it to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.960
 know more than well ask hello friend 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.479
 I have five baby guti I have three 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.609
 months with them and they have not grown up that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.530
 you recommend another question I have a 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.090
 50 liter aquarium want to put 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.960
 cicr and two small how many 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 you recommend thank you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.740
 for the growth of fingerlings the best 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 it's the live food and the frozen food 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.909
 but if you do not get both you can 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 get food for fingerlings 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 mix with crustacean shellfish or 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.520
 fish and maybe some vegetables 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.290
 boiled everything well shredded for you 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 50 liter aquarium I would put one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.550
 couple of dwarf cyclics though 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.000
 previously I would analyze the ph and the gh of 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.619
 water to know which cichlids to choose 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.869
 sebastián asks hello jose first that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.610
 all thank you for the videos I have 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 helped a lot with my aquarium a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.300
 question I think the bottom of my aquarium 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.270
 this upholstery as a kind of grass 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 thank you recommend me 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 pretty plant and in theory easy to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.330
 take care would be the up eurocine sb and other 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.890
 although not so easy would be the sanitary 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.840
 his mule is cellular variety although 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.670
 this type of carpet plants with a 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.530
 high lighting and a good subscriber 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.300
 it looks better you can also 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.330
 complete the upholstery by putting moss 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.250
 tied to smooth stones alexis question 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.890
 Hi, I would like to know what happens with my 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.250
 aquarium I have two pangas ios5 guppies 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 two nuns and an early and plant 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.570
 amazon would like to know why the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.560
 plant does not live much just one month it gets 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.660
 coffee is a 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.030
 of 40 liters greetings and I wait for your video 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.830
 answer they have overpopulation of fish 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.780
 for the size of your aquarium and also 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 the pandas are incompatible 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.709
 they need hundreds of liters and they also 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.540
 they could eat the rest of the fish and the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 sheet should not be there so you 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 I recommend giving all those fish the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.209
 cookies and the nuns if they are well 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.250
 you should also know that to maintain 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.200
 healthy plants you have to make changes of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.560
 weekly water of 30 percent as 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.750
 minimum 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.730
 of course water without chlorine and illuminate 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.099
 the aquarium about 7 hours a day more or 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.680
 less pigeon ask hello I have a 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.690
 question I bought an aquarium of 45 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.180
 liters and I have a beta male and two 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.340
 I would like to ask you what would be 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.010
 the right ph for them since I've 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.500
 bought a ph meter thanks for 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.490
 both species the ideal ph would be 7 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.880
 accepting between 6 and 7 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.040
 rm tj says good morning I would like to know 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.080
 how can I cure my scalars that 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.210
 they have the fins as torn I've 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.920
 observed in case they fought but between 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.960
 they get along very well and I can not find 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.970
 Almost information would be effective aloe 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.040
 You see, since that's all I see 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.140
 recommend for youtube if it serves you 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.120
 information are both in an aquarium 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.190
 of 100 liters with two runners and a 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.200
 ancestors and the aquarium has a lot 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.090
 vegetation co2 nine hours of 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.890
 lighting and fed them with the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.440
 Frozen Artemia long mosquitoes 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.900
 red and a few pulsing red landmarks that I think 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.600
 to fish that is called nasty kot that 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.310
 They are very small and they love aloe 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.020
 Vera is very good for these cases 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.790
 although I have not been able to use it yet 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.100
 it seems that it always gives good 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.230
 results you can also apply two 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.360
 drops of methylene blue per liter and if 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.489
 the thing gets ugly you should medicate with 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.620
 some specific medication for 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.959
 fin rot or if not medicate 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 conakry flavin at the rate of one gram each 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.650
 100 liters should also do 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.230
 water changes from plus or minus 15 to 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.520
 20% every two or three days so that 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.590
 fins will regenerate 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.080
 and watch them well because it's possible that 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.639
 fight when you are or maybe they have 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.650
 caught some infection by food 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.330
 I live outside, good guys, this has 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.120
 been everything I'm going to continue working and 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.979
 see you in the next video chao 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.900
 thanks for watching my videos here I leave you 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.800
 some more in case you have not seen them or 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.800
 you want to see them again
