take<00:05:52.090> him<00:05:52.240> out<00:05:52.330> at<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.510> very<00:05:52.659> least<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:53.050> can

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
take him out at the very least I can

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.500

just go for another one and it will die

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.089 
just go for another one and it will die
but<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.990> leaves<00:05:56.169> me<00:05:56.349> a<00:05:56.380> minus<00:05:56.770> 2<00:05:56.949> and
