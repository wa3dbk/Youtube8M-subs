00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.559
 Outbreak prevention outlet to protect your life and property 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:21.700
 Ya miyavi is 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:27.060
 Excellent outlet for disaster prevention function with built-in sensor that detects seat and temperature 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:32.240
 Let's take a closer look at the features that afternoon 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.240
 Ya senses the shaking of the earthquake 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.030
 Although it does not react to a momentary shock such as hitting it 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 The power will be cut off immediately if it detects a tremor of magnitude 5 or more three times in 10 seconds . 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.330
 There is a risk that a fallen appliance may cause a fire when the power stopped by the earthquake is restored. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.780
 I will 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 In the 1995 Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake, the main cause of the fire was due to the heating element by electricity 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.030
 Fire at the time of power transmission when it is regarded as a problem of its own secondary disaster 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.250
 How can we prevent it 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:38.750
 Kyoto University Disaster Prevention Research Institute involved in the development of Ya 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 I heard about the exchange professor and the reception is floral 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:49.620
 The army and the inside are getting messy I hope the heating element is inside 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 If you have a blackout, it's a consistent gel. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.090
 When it is minimal 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.680
 Thailand is that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.400
 Power companies in it that would cause the fixed fire Well the very dangerous 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.870
 We've been mainly that I please drop sometimes breaker of refuge Kedomo local flower 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.220
 Is that hard 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.840
 In the case of an away home 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.650
 That is positive 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 Without thinking especially Well it is the damage 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.530
 It is very important that you want to automatically shut off the power or vehicle power transmission. 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 I think it's important 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.990
 Since the power outlet can be controlled by the outlet itself, it is possible to prevent the resending electromagnetic disaster 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.870
 I will 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.870
 Even if power transmission is stopped, it will be restored easily by pressing the reset button. 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.540
 Please Zonchi Is that the outlet is fire due to many 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:55.620
 In the back of large-scale Kuwata and kitchen restroom 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.620
 The outlet that has been left behind is easy to collect dust 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:03.610
 Current flows in Pula Wuhan and accumulated dust, including the semifinals 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.070
 Take for shipping 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.070
 This phenomenon is tracking 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.640
 Ya senses signs of fire from electrical wiring 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.640
 Avoid the tracking phenomenon 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:31.280
 There is a case that the current which has flowed through the rewiring of lightning strikes the product of Shibata 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:36.970
 In the worst case this induced lightning also leads to fire 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.970
 It is possible to prevent by installing Ya 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.970
 Minutes 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.830
 Protect life and property from disasters 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:56.220
 Outbreak prevention outlet Ya 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:59.819
 It is also being introduced early in the temples and shrines is world heritage of Kyoto 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.500
 It is good from 20 years old Kasai in independence 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.040
 I want to popularize this product to protect my property 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.040
 I hope
