00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.039
 obviously for against paris grouping by returning to the score at the end of the match 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.939
 so 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.169
 that's because we wanted to go to the park 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.239
 as sochaux sought is what it takes to attack the fair market 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.300
 last minute value 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.310
 it proves that the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 the past group concerned I want to do something in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 show them that the defensive were solid bellerive for francis moment of the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860
 goal 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.220
 we have a little more success a little bit more luck scrabble have 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.460
 caused 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.420
 berlin it's very good that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.950
 how do you have coach 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 in his commentary in front of the surface changed difficult match and match 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.550
 the hard 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 and we expect however some nights 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.560
 the thermal spa rays we talked about a lot of 206 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.090
 we also talked about the points 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.560
 positive and negative in discomfort and this on all clean balloons 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.230
 93 dead 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.450
 121 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.700
 more only structures 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 we will play there at home like this famous public 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.870
 Why 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 of boxing world in an alley 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.260
 before meeting his wife 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 to his younger riflemen 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.240
 complicated where the best light vehicles have left their lives 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.470
 they want to do 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.930
 to be seen that in this vast of normal France is that my mentor 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.090
 so this stage 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.620
 I am attentive 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.710
 with southern passports 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.690
 to them to play as we know how to silence him 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.070
 and to score goals 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.070
 to win the game just ashamed to qualify for rome 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 for that's why these crowds turn you all to follow 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.649
 go back to work 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.129
 what we started at a difficult first part of the season 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.359
 laurent armand we finished well with his last two games scoring 34 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.549
 points 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.059
 what he wants to become for 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.479
 gold to work yet to get out the club a little bit of those of this 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.439
 difficulty to 2 of this 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.129
 of this ranking 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 so 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.939
 it confirms what I said I think we have a 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 we have a group 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.059
 extraordinary what is found in the locker room meanwhile 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.059
 at the level of the qualities of the players I think there was all that it takes 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 and a good state of mind we feel that since I feel 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.959
 are concerned with a postponement the project 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.179
 here in this section 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.329
 The objective is 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.560
 for the moment in any case for this beginning of the second half of the season 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.149
 it is the maintenance 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.999
 first take the points 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 get out of this red zone 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.489
 on the other hand to be able to 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.489
 any steven j 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.959
 a lot of tomorrow if you see the games at our fingertips 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.419
 World 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.019
 or nose then every time the farm 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.069
 the airlock has changed 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.489
 we had trouble 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.489
 to be confirmed trying two services 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 and that's what we struggled a little over five years would be at the beginning of the season 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.889
 it would be past I think 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.040
 a lack of collective effort 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.089
 we know it 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.279
 good for sure we did and now we will try to 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.189
 by his mistakes 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.189
 to move forward to move forward 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.430
 with a young group in the making to make some mistakes once in a while 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.079
 that's how we understand it experience 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.879
 so here I hope that 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.939
 x3 3 this season 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939
 examples we have grown a little by little everyone 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.309
 the pink race on request
