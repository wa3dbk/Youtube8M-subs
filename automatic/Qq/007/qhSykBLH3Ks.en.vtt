00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 morning youtube nokia 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.539
 we are what to do on Sunday after the double in 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.149
 the grand prix of germany 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.579
 but already on the eve of the Hungarian Grand Prix 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.419
 which 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.200
 the greater feeling that one breathes in maranello 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.769
 after this success 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.579
 but I must say great satisfaction and above all because the period has come 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.550
 hard 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 and we all ask our fans together for you 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.050
 command said so many times we had not gathered the fruit of our work 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.970
 so I am particularly satisfied because 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.580
 the result of all this requires 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.250
 has shown a 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.370
 then text tonight or really morning 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 re contra pilots always 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 from the first round to the end therefore great satisfaction 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 can say that we have taken the right direction 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.859
 it also means that we don't have to stop right here because we know 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.549
 how difficult it is that our opponents continue to push its development 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.949
 so let's say an excellent oxygen lawyer to continue 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.510
 in this run-up to why 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 I repeat, we still believe what we can achieve 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.890
 which do you think was the technical key 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.990
 of this 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.490
 or this comeback 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.870
 in terms of fetish performance 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.990
 but I believe that the key technique of this is a lot has started from a good one 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 based on his point of view 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.360
 looking mechanical 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 and after suffering 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.010
 say in the months 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.810
 eeee around may june 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.850
 the grand prix by 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.210
 vat spain 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.010
 see turkey 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.579
 and where we have not collected points of knowledge I believe this technician 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.669
 the development that we resumed from drinking in the wind tunnel brought the 

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.020
 greater fesse the car 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.500
 and this made it possible to exploit the potential 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.100
 Now let's go to Hungary as your forecast for this race 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.740
 but the forecast 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.720
 and must always be very cautious and clear that this result mention one 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.740
 major condition our means 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.460
 and that decides to face this trip before the summer break with the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.729
 belief that we can do well 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.419
 we will see what our spills will do but in short we cross our fingers but 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.739
 we want to bring home a good result 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.750
 it's a race 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.229
 special for felipe massa back 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.689
 a little over a year later on the circuit 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.829
 where last year and it's that dramatic accident 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.580
 you think this is for him 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.429
 a particular weekend 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:36.779
 but I believe it is a weekend and that for felipe messa latino d 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.739
 d memories 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.069
 I am convinced that he will want to demonstrate the pilot who has returned to 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.019
 to be and then I frontera it with a moment particular evening pin 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:52.769
 and yet I have to say don't forget about what happened on a year ago su 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.549
 lost strafelice 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.829
 which is still here with the same machine 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.629
 for fernando it will be anyway 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.389
 a special how i can 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.600
 it is his birthday and he runs on the track where he is 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.969
 wins his first Formula 1 race 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.969
 in 2003, even for him some more motivation 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.019
 but I believe that to send the most important motivation beyond 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.410
 of the fact that he has 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.379
 vito - his first race 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.389
 in his that was more of formula 1 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.290
 both to have seen a car that has started to go back as and more 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.259
 good 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:34.099
 and therefore the motivation to do well starts from this the fact of the 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.720
 home portal 25 points 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.829
 in Germany 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.680
 expatriation to do for half among many before resting 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.709
 site we return to hungary mar little more than a year later 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.739
 that grand prize like that 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.179
 especially for you what your emotions are 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.349
 palermo action to return 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.359
 in Hungary, having had a very difficult time coming back there 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.529
 rr moment ballack make a nice race 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.110
 see the people that 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.409
 that 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.959
 who treated me well 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.209
 santa maria to greet 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.819
 why 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.680
 d to avoid a different way to us say that they arrived at the hospital 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.999
 so it doesn't have a good time but moments where 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.999
 to be very important a very good result 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.300
 traced from high downforce info sites similar to monaco 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.499
 what it takes to have a winning machine at the hungaroring 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.809
 ma lin 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.379
 hungaroring eontra will be a track where you need yourself 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:42.960
 oh dark force 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.860
 d on the ground 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.450
 ah of the car as a monk I have so many currents 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.749
 many currents of god of the summer slows down important 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:53.889
 to have id 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.349
 of the car 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:56.740
 so it is 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.930
 there is also a track where 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.840
 overtaking and motorcycle moto it 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.839
 hard 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.239
 so to have a good qualification he had a car in the city 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.439
 the antonella lara potatoes 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.849
 budapest from is a circuit 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.000
 special because you won yours first 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.810
 races formula 1 what you remember of that day you see that weekend a good one 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.819
 to always remain if this 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.479
 very special for me 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.479
 first victory in formula 1 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.479
 many good memories paul positions last year 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.110
 of that first victory is not that I remember so much because it was so 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.120
 exciting I lived of 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.110
 in moments 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.219
 very special good day dear end you forget why 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.830
 the wines at full speed 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.639
 everything goes very fast poor web press conference 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.510
 the greeting the photos with the capricorn team of particular moments but 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.509
 not in general the day then 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.909
 always shows 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.639
 tell us about the hub eur circuit instead what 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.569
 it takes to have a winning machine there 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.469
 See you soon in Hungary 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.599
 vercelli secret more important to have 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.810
 a car that is suitable for the bar 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.589
 the road that bank curbs 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:21.020
 a circuit spoon circuit go kart formula 1 then 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.180
 it is a continuation of courbet there is never I can 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.009
 mail over the curbs there are the external braking action go sideways in 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.689
 a few bends so it's a bit 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.040
 how to make a normal circuit but a 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.680
 not 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.949
 nikon of the riderelli machines more or less then 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.900
 a very nice feeling very difficult to drive very demanding like 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.330
 downstream circuit - physical at the sicolo level I also say therefore 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.039
 draw tidal flesh in that circuit do 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:07:00.210
 and your job but don't let go of this alp need for di 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.389
 of Milan to the maximum that you 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.529
 that the judgment of merit 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:06.080
 4 good to me
