what's up youtubers KB here and we're
going<00:00:15.400> to<00:00:15.430> be<00:00:15.520> doing<00:00:15.670> something<00:00:16.000> different

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
going to be doing something different

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.670 
going to be doing something different
but<00:00:16.510> I<00:00:16.570> want<00:00:16.810> to<00:00:16.869> make<00:00:16.960> it<00:00:17.080> this<00:00:17.200> new<00:00:17.410> segment

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
but I want to make it this new segment

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.070 
but I want to make it this new segment
called<00:00:18.040> app<00:00:18.400> discovery<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.240> what<00:00:19.960> we're

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
called app discovery and what we're

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.679 
called app discovery and what we're
playing<00:00:20.560> here<00:00:20.740> is<00:00:20.860> hovercraft<00:00:21.610> bill<00:00:22.330> fly

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
playing here is hovercraft bill fly

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.560 
playing here is hovercraft bill fly
retry<00:00:23.350> basically<00:00:24.310> this<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.700> very<00:00:24.939> simple<00:00:25.300> game

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
retry basically this is very simple game

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.560 
retry basically this is very simple game
but<00:00:25.810> it's<00:00:26.080> really<00:00:27.040> interesting<00:00:27.520> and<00:00:28.030> how<00:00:28.390> they

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
but it's really interesting and how they

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.450 
but it's really interesting and how they
do<00:00:28.990> everything<00:00:29.260> in<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.590> because<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.310> can

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
do everything in it because you can

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.040 
do everything in it because you can
basically<00:00:30.640> create<00:00:30.910> any<00:00:31.420> heart<00:00:31.660> craft<00:00:31.900> that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
basically create any heart craft that

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.450 
basically create any heart craft that
you<00:00:32.199> want<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.720> can<00:00:34.900> fly<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:36.280> is<00:00:36.430> just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
you want and you can fly it this is just

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.420 
you want and you can fly it this is just
the<00:00:36.699> generic<00:00:37.090> one<00:00:37.330> that<00:00:37.449> you<00:00:37.510> start<00:00:37.750> out<00:00:37.870> with

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the generic one that you start out with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.410 
the generic one that you start out with
and<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:39.520> is<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.790> controls<00:00:40.090> are<00:00:40.210> very<00:00:40.239> simple

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
and this is the controls are very simple

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.910 
and this is the controls are very simple
and<00:00:40.840> you're<00:00:40.930> just<00:00:41.080> tapping<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.559> left<00:00:41.680> or

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
and you're just tapping the left or

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.100 
and you're just tapping the left or
right<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.190> screen<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.750> have<00:00:43.900> your

right of the screen and you have your

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.100 
right of the screen and you have your
gas<00:00:44.379> up<00:00:44.769> down<00:00:45.010> below<00:00:45.220> so<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.210> more<00:00:46.449> blocks<00:00:46.839> or

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
gas up down below so the more blocks or

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.890 
gas up down below so the more blocks or
bricks<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.559> have<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.970> more<00:00:49.180> gas<00:00:49.479> you<00:00:49.720> have

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
bricks you have the more gas you have

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.329 
bricks you have the more gas you have
you'll<00:00:50.080> see<00:00:50.229> this<00:00:50.320> later<00:00:50.500> on<00:00:50.589> I'm<00:00:51.070> gonna<00:00:51.220> try

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
to create something a small vehicle that

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.369 
to create something a small vehicle that
only<00:00:53.530> has<00:00:53.739> like<00:00:54.129> 25<00:00:54.610> 26<00:00:54.790> blocks<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.750> I'm

we're something into the realm of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.890 
we're something into the realm of
building<00:01:12.280> stuff<00:01:12.430> here<00:01:12.640> see<00:01:13.570> all<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.780> crazy

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
building stuff here see all the crazy

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.240 
building stuff here see all the crazy
different<00:01:14.290> colors<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:14.799> can<00:01:14.830> get<00:01:15.040> on<00:01:15.159> the

different colors you can get on the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.700 
different colors you can get on the
blocks<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.060> even<00:01:16.570> tell<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.870> direction

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
blocks and even tell you the direction

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.890 
blocks and even tell you the direction
to<00:01:18.040> their<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.610> me<00:01:18.730> pointing<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.570> basically

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
to their to me pointing it's basically

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.090 
to their to me pointing it's basically
that<00:01:20.140> little<00:01:20.380> block<00:01:20.620> you<00:01:20.770> see<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.010> middle

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
that little block you see in the middle

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.500 
that little block you see in the middle
is<00:01:21.370> basically<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.930> you're<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:24.300> overall<00:01:25.300> if

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
is basically that you're the overall if

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.420 
is basically that you're the overall if
that<00:01:25.660> destroyed<00:01:26.380> you're<00:01:26.590> all<00:01:26.680> done<00:01:26.890> with<00:01:26.920> you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
that destroyed you're all done with you

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.770 
that destroyed you're all done with you
can<00:01:27.520> see<00:01:27.700> some<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.030> random<00:01:28.300> other<00:01:28.420> crafts

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
can see some of the random other crafts

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.260 
can see some of the random other crafts
that<00:01:28.960> I'll<00:01:29.050> have<00:01:29.400> you'll<00:01:30.400> hit<00:01:30.640> something<00:01:31.060> and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that I'll have you'll hit something and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.510 
that I'll have you'll hit something and
you'll<00:01:31.360> still<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.810> propelling<00:01:32.350> forward<00:01:32.620> going

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
you'll still be propelling forward going

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.790 
you'll still be propelling forward going
off<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.910> ramp<00:01:34.150> hitting<00:01:34.810> another<00:01:34.990> card<00:01:35.440> so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
off the ramp hitting another card so

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.850 
off the ramp hitting another card so
forth<00:01:36.100> dodging<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.180> out<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.390> traffic<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
forth dodging in and out of traffic but

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.670 
forth dodging in and out of traffic but
yeah<00:01:39.160> like<00:01:39.460> it's<00:01:40.080> it's<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.230> pretty<00:01:41.470> interesting

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
yeah like it's it's a pretty interesting

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.920 
yeah like it's it's a pretty interesting
stuff<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:43.030> I'm<00:01:43.210> just<00:01:43.240> gonna

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
stuff and I'm just gonna

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.290 
stuff and I'm just gonna
don't<00:01:44.470> judge<00:01:44.740> me<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.070> just<00:01:45.400> randomly<00:01:46.000> build

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
don't judge me here just randomly build

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.640 
don't judge me here just randomly build
something<00:01:46.660> here<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.050> hopefully<00:01:47.800> goes<00:01:48.190> well

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
something here and hopefully goes well

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.070 
something here and hopefully goes well
again<00:01:50.650> I'm<00:01:50.770> trying<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.980> go<00:01:51.040> for<00:01:51.220> small<00:01:51.870> but<00:01:52.870> I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
again I'm trying to go for small but I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.470 
again I'm trying to go for small but I
didn't<00:01:53.530> honestly<00:01:54.040> calculate<00:01:54.790> on<00:01:55.000> the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
didn't honestly calculate on the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.110 
didn't honestly calculate on the
complete<00:01:56.140> fuel<00:01:56.620> size<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.640> went<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> half<00:01:58.000> so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
complete fuel size that went a half so

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.490 
complete fuel size that went a half so
I'm<00:01:58.180> gonna<00:01:58.360> put<00:01:58.600> these<00:01:58.690> boosters<00:01:59.290> or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
I'm gonna put these boosters or

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.410 
I'm gonna put these boosters or
thrusters<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.100> right<00:02:00.850> on<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.120> on<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.270> bottom

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
thrusters on right on here on the bottom

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.050 
thrusters on right on here on the bottom
so<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.409> get<00:02:02.590> some<00:02:02.680> nice<00:02:02.860> lift<00:02:03.190> here<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.670> just<00:02:03.940> be

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
so I get some nice lift here and just be

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.860 
so I get some nice lift here and just be
good<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.420> go<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:06.460> very<00:02:06.520> simple<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.659> this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870

it kind of make it aerodynamic as

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.440 
it kind of make it aerodynamic as
possible<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.050> square<00:02:14.470> can<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:16.180> some

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
possible as a square can be that's some

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.390 
possible as a square can be that's some
color<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.260> give<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.159> little<00:02:18.370> tail<00:02:19.650> nice<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
color here give it a little tail nice it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550 
color here give it a little tail nice it
looks<00:02:21.579> pretty<00:02:21.790> good<00:02:21.909> I'm<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.299> save<00:02:22.599> it
