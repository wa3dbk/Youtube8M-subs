the way around the point now I've really
got<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.360> try<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.750> get<00:02:02.900> something<00:02:03.140> back<00:02:03.440> on<00:02:03.650> it

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.160 
got to try and get something back on it
I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:05.440> absolutely<00:02:06.440> beautiful<00:02:09.610> I've<00:02:10.610> got<00:02:10.850> it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
I think absolutely beautiful I've got it

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.979 
I think absolutely beautiful I've got it
who<00:02:12.820> haven't<00:02:13.820> gotten<00:02:13.940> unhooking<00:02:14.450> mat<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.810> me

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
who haven't gotten unhooking mat with me

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.320 
who haven't gotten unhooking mat with me
but<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.650> grass<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.070> very<00:02:16.280> soft<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.060> think

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
but the grass is very soft it I think

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.710 
but the grass is very soft it I think
we'll<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.480> fine<00:02:17.830> very<00:02:18.830> long<00:02:19.160> sort<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.720> soft

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we'll be fine very long sort of soft

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.760
