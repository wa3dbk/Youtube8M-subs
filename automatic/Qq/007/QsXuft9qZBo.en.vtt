inside<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.530> pad<00:00:47.090> Big<00:00:48.090> Agnes<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:49.260> lined<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
inside the pad Big Agnes has lined the

pad with Ecstatic synthetic insulation

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
pad with Ecstatic synthetic insulation
so<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.510> makes<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.870> warmer<00:00:55.530> than<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
so it also makes it warmer than the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.650 
so it also makes it warmer than the
average<00:00:56.489> inflatable<00:00:57.420> sleeping<00:00:57.660> pad

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660

three-season usage but of warm pad for
three-season<00:01:03.539> usage<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.890> inflatable<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
three-season usage it is inflatable so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
three-season usage it is inflatable so
you<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.299> need<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> blow<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> pad<00:01:07.860> there's

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you do need to blow up the pad there's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
you do need to blow up the pad there's
an<00:01:08.670> integrated<00:01:09.150> nozzle<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.320> corner

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
an integrated nozzle here at the corner

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130

because of that quilted design it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.490 
because of that quilted design it
actually<00:01:13.890> blows<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.400> faster<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.290> I've

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
actually blows up faster and then I've

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
actually blows up faster and then I've
