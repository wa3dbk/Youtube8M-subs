00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
bicep just our movement like that which

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.270 
bicep just our movement like that which
seems<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.320> be<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> case<00:02:59.650> was<00:02:59.860> fight<00:03:00.040> over<00:03:00.190> in

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
seems to be the case was fight over in

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610 
seems to be the case was fight over in
classic<00:03:00.790> figures<00:03:01.150> legs<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.140> go<00:03:02.200> back<00:03:02.410> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
classic figures legs and go back and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.190 
classic figures legs and go back and
forward<00:03:03.010> can't<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:03.820> back<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.600> much<00:03:04.840> unless

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
forward can't go back that much unless

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.040 
forward can't go back that much unless
you<00:03:05.380> like<00:03:05.560> really<00:03:05.920> bend<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.580> but<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.050> this

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
you like really bend it but if you this

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.449 
you like really bend it but if you this
doing<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.440> lightly<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.920> doesn't<00:03:09.130> really<00:03:09.220> want

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
doing it lightly it doesn't really want

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.630 
doing it lightly it doesn't really want
to<00:03:09.520> move<00:03:09.640> these<00:03:10.480> knee<00:03:11.230> can<00:03:11.500> bend<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.070> rotate

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
to move these knee can bend and rotate

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.400 
to move these knee can bend and rotate
and<00:03:13.060> that's<00:03:13.390> why<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
and that's why you have really on the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.430 
and that's why you have really on the
legs<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.270> no<00:03:16.270> no<00:03:16.990> waste<00:03:17.170> articulation<00:03:18.209> but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
legs and no no waste articulation but

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.110
