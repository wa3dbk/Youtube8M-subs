00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
went for an entire four minutes where I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.279 
went for an entire four minutes where I
go<00:00:16.740> 20<00:00:17.190> seconds<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.539> ladder<00:00:18.930> drills

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
go 20 seconds of doing it ladder drills

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.470 
go 20 seconds of doing it ladder drills
I<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.590> forward<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.310> backwards<00:00:21.029> through<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I go forward and backwards through the

ladder doing certain drills for 20

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
ladder doing certain drills for 20
seconds<00:00:24.210> once<00:00:24.449> doesn't<00:00:24.930> matter<00:00:25.080> where<00:00:25.289> I'm<00:00:25.410> at

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
seconds once doesn't matter where I'm at

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.349 
seconds once doesn't matter where I'm at
in<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> ladder<00:00:26.160> once<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> 20<00:00:26.789> seconds<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> up

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
in a ladder once the 20 seconds is up

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
in a ladder once the 20 seconds is up
you<00:00:27.539> stop<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.710> 10<00:00:28.949> second<00:00:29.400> rest

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you stop then in 10 second rest

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.609 
you stop then in 10 second rest
sometimes<00:00:30.599> there's<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:30.990> than<00:00:31.109> 10<00:00:31.260> seconds

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
sometimes there's more than 10 seconds

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.410 
sometimes there's more than 10 seconds
but<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:31.980> walk<00:00:32.160> away<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> ladder<00:00:32.880> try

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
but I will walk away from the ladder try

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
but I will walk away from the ladder try
to<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.290> breath<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.040> possible<00:00:35.190> was

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
to get my breath as much as possible was

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
to get my breath as much as possible was
20<00:00:36.030> seconds<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.840> ten-second<00:00:37.620> rest<00:00:37.800> then

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
20 seconds on then ten-second rest then

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
20 seconds on then ten-second rest then
come<00:00:38.250> right<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> again<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:40.020> another

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
come right back do it again for another

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
come right back do it again for another
20<00:00:40.590> seconds<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.129> went<00:00:41.340> through<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.550> for

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
20 seconds and we went through this for

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
20 seconds and we went through this for
four<00:00:42.000> minutes<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> means<00:00:42.930> each<00:00:43.170> group<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
four minutes so that means each group is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
four minutes so that means each group is
30<00:00:44.579> seconds<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> eight<00:00:46.110> sets<00:00:47.300> 20

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
30 seconds so actually the eight sets 20

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
30 seconds so actually the eight sets 20
seconds<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> peace<00:00:49.100> going<00:00:50.100> through<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> speed

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
seconds of peace going through the speed

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
seconds of peace going through the speed
ladder<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.750> had<00:00:51.989> eight<00:00:52.260> ten<00:00:53.129> second

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ladder and then I had eight ten second

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
ladder and then I had eight ten second
dress<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> four<00:00:55.170> minute<00:00:55.440> period<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
dress over a four minute period and it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
dress over a four minute period and it
doesn't<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.550> seem<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.180> long<00:00:57.420> time<00:00:57.480> but

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
doesn't really seem like a long time but

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
doesn't really seem like a long time but
if<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.469> sit<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.829> watch<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.370> whole<00:00:59.609> thing

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
if you sit and watch this whole thing

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.229 
if you sit and watch this whole thing
you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.890> definitely<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.460> burn

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you can see definitely how this can burn

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
you can see definitely how this can burn
the<00:01:03.390> hell<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.899> lungs<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.470> legs

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the hell out of your lungs and your legs

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
the hell out of your lungs and your legs
doing<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.150> four<00:01:06.360> minutes<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.780> four

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
doing this for four minutes at four

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
doing this for four minutes at four
minutes<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.500> said<00:01:07.680> don't<00:01:07.799> seem<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
minutes like I said don't seem like a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890 
minutes like I said don't seem like a
long<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.939> you're<00:01:09.030> doing<00:01:09.240> explosive

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
long time when you're doing explosive

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.440 
long time when you're doing explosive
speed<00:01:10.740> movement<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> long<00:01:12.210> time

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
speed movement it really is a long time

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.230 
speed movement it really is a long time
because<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.840> burner<00:01:13.140> gets<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> quickly

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
because that burner gets to you quickly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.370 
because that burner gets to you quickly
so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.659> ahead<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.810> check<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so you can go ahead and check out this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.950 
so you can go ahead and check out this
whole<00:01:16.619> set<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> did<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> offsets

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
whole set see how I did with the offsets

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.770 
whole set see how I did with the offsets
and<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.500> sets<00:01:19.909> or<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.630> between

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and on sets or what I do in between

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
and on sets or what I do in between
exercises<00:01:22.530> try<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.520> breath<00:01:23.790> before
