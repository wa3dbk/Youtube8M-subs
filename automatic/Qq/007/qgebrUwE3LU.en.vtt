course on PSC 12 in this section we're
continuing<00:00:13.790> to<00:00:13.820> look<00:00:14.150> at<00:00:14.420> various<00:00:15.260> ways<00:00:15.710> of

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
continuing to look at various ways of

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.109 
continuing to look at various ways of
retouching<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.590> enhancing<00:00:18.590> images<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.520> in

particular<00:00:20.300> in<00:00:21.050> this<00:00:21.260> section<00:00:21.560> we're<00:00:21.949> going

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
particular in this section we're going

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.019 
particular in this section we're going
to<00:00:22.310> look<00:00:22.520> at<00:00:23.020> recomposing<00:00:24.020> an<00:00:24.230> image<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:25.100> have

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
to look at recomposing an image I have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.180 
to look at recomposing an image I have
one<00:00:26.240> here<00:00:26.539> which<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.750> taken<00:00:27.230> at<00:00:27.350> some<00:00:27.619> distance

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
one here which is taken at some distance

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.790 
one here which is taken at some distance
from<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.640> group<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.210> bison<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.410> Bison

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
from a group of bison and the Bison

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.369 
from a group of bison and the Bison
themselves<00:00:31.250> are<00:00:31.340> quite<00:00:31.430> spread<00:00:32.090> out<00:00:32.350> one<00:00:33.350> of

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
themselves are quite spread out one of

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.139 
themselves are quite spread out one of
the<00:00:33.620> things<00:00:33.979> you<00:00:34.309> can<00:00:34.550> do<00:00:34.819> in<00:00:35.210> PSC<00:00:35.929> 12<00:00:36.319> is<00:00:36.679> to

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
the things you can do in PSC 12 is to

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.540 
the things you can do in PSC 12 is to
recompose<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.210> photo<00:00:38.749> like<00:00:39.139> this<00:00:39.170> one<00:00:39.589> so<00:00:40.249> for

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
recompose a photo like this one so for

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.219 
recompose a photo like this one so for
example<00:00:41.030> if<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.239> have<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> group<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:41.749> this

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
example if you have a group like this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.770 
example if you have a group like this
and<00:00:42.469> you'd<00:00:43.010> really<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.969> restructure<00:00:44.539> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
and you'd really like to restructure the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.770 
and you'd really like to restructure the
image<00:00:45.049> in<00:00:45.229> terms<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.949> moving<00:00:46.699> some<00:00:47.629> of<00:00:47.659> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
image in terms of moving some of the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.049 
image in terms of moving some of the
contents<00:00:48.440> closer<00:00:48.739> together<00:00:49.039> or<00:00:49.699> even<00:00:49.940> for

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
contents closer together or even for

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.270 
contents closer together or even for
that<00:00:50.089> matter<00:00:50.210> making<00:00:51.079> them<00:00:51.229> further<00:00:51.530> apart

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that matter making them further apart

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.669 
that matter making them further apart
then<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.089> can<00:00:53.239> do<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.659> in<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.049> couple<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.440> ways

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
then you can do that in a couple of ways

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.149 
then you can do that in a couple of ways
and<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:55.879> them<00:00:56.269> is<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.690> actually<00:00:57.129> recompose

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
and one of them is to actually recompose

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.129 
and one of them is to actually recompose
the<00:00:58.639> image<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.420> that's<00:00:59.690> what<00:00:59.869> we're<00:00:59.959> going<00:01:00.049> to

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
the image and that's what we're going to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.439 
the image and that's what we're going to
look<00:01:00.289> at<00:01:00.499> in<00:01:00.679> this<00:01:00.859> section<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:01.639> although<00:01:02.269> this

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
look at in this section so although this

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.660 
look at in this section so although this
photo<00:01:02.719> has<00:01:02.989> quite<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.379> reasonable<00:01:03.619> setting<00:01:04.489> I'd

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
photo has quite a reasonable setting I'd

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.540 
photo has quite a reasonable setting I'd
like<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.690> crop<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:06.980> can<00:01:07.250> make

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
like to crop it so that I can make

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.100 
like to crop it so that I can make
particularly<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.210> Bison<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.810> middle

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
particularly the Bison in the middle

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.740 
particularly the Bison in the middle
they're<00:01:09.260> bigger<00:01:09.640> but<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.670> know<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.180> if<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:11.450> crop

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
they're bigger but I know that if I crop

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.020 
they're bigger but I know that if I crop
it<00:01:11.930> I'm<00:01:12.080> likely<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.410> lose<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:13.250> one<00:01:13.550> on<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
it I'm likely to lose this one on the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.490 
it I'm likely to lose this one on the
right<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.390> possibly<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.960> little<00:01:15.170> one<00:01:15.320> on<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
right and possibly the little one on the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.540 
right and possibly the little one on the
left<00:01:15.770> there<00:01:15.980> as<00:01:16.130> well<00:01:16.370> so<00:01:17.800> ideally<00:01:18.800> I'd<00:01:19.070> move

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
left there as well so ideally I'd move

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.210 
left there as well so ideally I'd move
these<00:01:20.090> bison<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.780> little<00:01:21.200> bit<00:01:21.320> closer<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.070> each

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
these bison a little bit closer to each

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.250 
these bison a little bit closer to each
other<00:01:22.930> now<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.500> recompose<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:25.790> photo<00:01:26.230> what<00:01:27.230> I

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
other now to recompose this photo what I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.170 
other now to recompose this photo what I
do<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.160> tell<00:01:28.730> PSC<00:01:29.330> 12<00:01:29.780> which<00:01:30.620> parts<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.400> the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
do is I tell PSC 12 which parts of the

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.020 
do is I tell PSC 12 which parts of the
photo<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.870> want<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> keep<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.710> which<00:01:34.280> parts<00:01:34.790> I'm

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
photo I want to keep and which parts I'm

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.510 
photo I want to keep and which parts I'm
prepared<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.780> lose<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.280> let<00:01:37.490> it

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
prepared to lose and then I let it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.690 
prepared to lose and then I let it
recompose<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.720> image<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.410> me<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:40.280> let's

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
recompose the image for me so let's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.780 
recompose the image for me so let's
start<00:01:41.120> by<00:01:41.570> invoking<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.770> recomposed<00:01:43.430> tool

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
start by invoking the recomposed tool

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.580 
start by invoking the recomposed tool
you<00:01:44.030> can<00:01:44.240> get<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.480> from<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.930> image<00:01:45.380> menu

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you can get it from the image menu

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.700 
you can get it from the image menu
there's<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.610> recompose<00:01:47.270> option<00:01:47.810> or<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
there's a recompose option or in the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.440 
there's a recompose option or in the
modifier<00:01:49.370> group<00:01:49.640> over<00:01:50.030> here<00:01:50.060> there's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
modifier group over here there's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.660 
modifier group over here there's
actually<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.990> recomposed<00:01:51.830> tool<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:52.490> let's

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually a recomposed tool so let's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.690 
actually a recomposed tool so let's
click<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.380> recompose<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.100> first<00:01:55.340> thing<00:01:55.520> to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
click on recompose the first thing to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.750 
click on recompose the first thing to
note<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.320> recompose<00:01:58.010> we<00:01:58.670> are

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
note is that when we recompose we are

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.540 
note is that when we recompose we are
basically<00:01:59.030> going<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.360> resize<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.530> image<00:02:00.770> of

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
basically going to resize this image of

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.580 
basically going to resize this image of
course<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.240> then<00:02:02.390> subsequently<00:02:02.990> perform

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
course we can then subsequently perform

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.500 
course we can then subsequently perform
other<00:02:03.830> operations<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.060> get<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
other operations on it to get it to the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.739 
other operations on it to get it to the
size<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:06.080> want<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.640> anticipation<00:02:08.450> of

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:08.749 
size that we want but in anticipation of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.770 
size that we want but in anticipation of
this<00:02:08.959> resize<00:02:09.499> you<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.889> specify<00:02:10.189> here<00:02:11.030> what

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
this resize you can specify here what

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.500 
this resize you can specify here what
size<00:02:12.139> you<00:02:12.469> would<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:13.040> result

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
size you would like the result

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.649 
size you would like the result
image<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.849> could<00:02:16.209> say<00:02:16.330> there's<00:02:16.540> no

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
image to be so you could say there's no

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.780 
image to be so you could say there's no
restriction<00:02:17.409> or<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.769> could<00:02:17.950> say<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.159> want<00:02:18.489> in

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
restriction or you could say you want in

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.809 
restriction or you could say you want in
the<00:02:18.970> same<00:02:19.239> ratio<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.560> original<00:02:21.040> photo<00:02:21.310> or

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the same ratio as the original photo or

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.880 
the same ratio as the original photo or
you<00:02:22.150> could<00:02:22.299> specify<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.930> size<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.739> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you could specify the size that you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.780 
you could specify the size that you
would<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.549> recomposed<00:02:25.239> image<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.049> be

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
would like the recomposed image to be

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
would like the recomposed image to be
now<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.849> way<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.599> recompose<00:02:29.560> is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
now the way that the recompose is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.780 
now the way that the recompose is
actually<00:02:30.640> performed<00:02:31.329> by<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:33.340> drag<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
actually performed by you is to drag the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.789 
actually performed by you is to drag the
sizing<00:02:34.480> handles<00:02:34.510> as<00:02:35.079> though<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.620> was

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
sizing handles as though you was

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.430 
sizing handles as though you was
cropping<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.610> image<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:37.299> but<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.959> doesn't

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
cropping the image really but it doesn't

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.849 
cropping the image really but it doesn't
crop<00:02:38.890> what<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.549> does<00:02:39.760> instead<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.440> remove

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
crop what it does instead is to remove

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.399 
crop what it does instead is to remove
the<00:02:42.340> parts<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.030> image<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.359> you<00:02:43.870> indicate

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
the parts of the image that you indicate

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.339 
the parts of the image that you indicate
you<00:02:44.799> are<00:02:44.980> prepared<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.519> have<00:02:45.790> removed<00:02:46.349> now

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
you are prepared to have removed now

how<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:24.099> this<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.699> really<00:03:24.760> quite<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.660> bit<00:03:25.900> of

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
how you do this is really quite a bit of

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.349 
how you do this is really quite a bit of
a<00:03:26.079> matter<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.730> experimentation<00:03:27.730> with<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> lot

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
a matter of experimentation with a lot

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.110 
a matter of experimentation with a lot
of<00:03:28.480> images<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.280> sometimes<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.489> tend<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.849> sort

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
of images and sometimes I tend to sort

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.879 
of images and sometimes I tend to sort
of<00:03:31.239> try<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> play<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> little<00:03:32.109> bit<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.620> safe

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
of try to play a little bit on the safe

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.009 
of try to play a little bit on the safe
side<00:03:32.919> but<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.239> particular<00:03:34.599> occasion

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
side but on this particular occasion

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.949 
side but on this particular occasion
let's<00:03:35.500> say<00:03:35.859> I'm<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.609> keep<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.870> I'm

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
let's say I'm going to keep what I'm

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.500 
let's say I'm going to keep what I'm
going<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.139> do<00:03:38.199> is<00:03:38.290> indicate<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.859> Bison<00:03:39.389> now<00:03:40.389> in

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
going to do is indicate the Bison now in

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.610 
going to do is indicate the Bison now in
order<00:03:40.629> to<00:03:40.780> indicate<00:03:40.989> them<00:03:41.319> I'm<00:03:41.410> going<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
order to indicate them I'm going to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.949 
order to indicate them I'm going to
brush<00:03:41.949> over<00:03:42.190> them<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.760> size<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.480> brush<00:03:43.660> is

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
brush over them the size of the brush is

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
brush over them the size of the brush is
here<00:03:44.260> I've<00:03:44.410> got<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.620> set<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:44.889> 100<00:03:45.310> pixels<00:03:45.459> at

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
here I've got it set to 100 pixels at

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.349 
here I've got it set to 100 pixels at
the<00:03:46.090> moment<00:03:46.480> I'm<00:03:46.750> going<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.980> just<00:03:48.359> effectively

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the moment I'm going to just effectively

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.180 
the moment I'm going to just effectively
brush<00:03:49.810> over<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.780> keep<00:03:53.079> those<00:03:53.440> bison

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
brush over I want to keep those bison

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.750 
brush over I want to keep those bison
and<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:56.049> want<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.290> keep<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.650> spacing<00:03:57.370> as<00:03:57.519> well

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and I want to keep that spacing as well

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.030 
and I want to keep that spacing as well
because<00:03:58.150> by<00:03:58.750> marking<00:03:59.169> over<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> spaces

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
because by marking over the spaces

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.909 
because by marking over the spaces
between<00:04:00.220> them<00:04:00.699> I'm<00:04:00.909> keeping<00:04:01.480> them<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.379> I<00:04:02.739> also

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
between them I'm keeping them and I also

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.629 
between them I'm keeping them and I also
want<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.340> keep<00:04:03.609> this<00:04:04.299> bison<00:04:04.959> over<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:06.549> I'm

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
want to keep this bison over here so I'm

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.330 
want to keep this bison over here so I'm
going<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:06.940> bring<00:04:07.209> that<00:04:07.269> one<00:04:07.659> and<00:04:08.190> then<00:04:09.190> what

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
going to bring that one and then what

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.550 
going to bring that one and then what
I'm<00:04:09.489> prepared<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.000> lose<00:04:10.419> what<00:04:10.989> I'm<00:04:11.169> prepared

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
I'm prepared to lose what I'm prepared

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.069 
I'm prepared to lose what I'm prepared
to<00:04:11.620> be<00:04:11.829> removed<00:04:12.310> will<00:04:12.729> be<00:04:12.849> marked<00:04:13.269> in<00:04:13.389> red<00:04:13.510> I

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
to be removed will be marked in red I

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.020 
to be removed will be marked in red I
can<00:04:14.560> use<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.889> same<00:04:15.099> size<00:04:15.400> brush<00:04:15.760> or<00:04:15.970> a

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
can use the same size brush or a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.699 
can use the same size brush or a
different<00:04:16.389> size<00:04:16.599> brush<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.169> think<00:04:17.530> for<00:04:17.650> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
different size brush I think for the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.860 
different size brush I think for the
moment<00:04:17.829> I'll<00:04:18.130> use<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.579> same<00:04:18.849> size<00:04:19.150> brush<00:04:19.570> and

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
moment I'll use the same size brush and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.370 
moment I'll use the same size brush and
I'm<00:04:19.959> going<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.169> say<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:21.090> well<00:04:22.090> all<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:23.020> that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
I'm going to say that well all of that

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.379 
I'm going to say that well all of that
can<00:04:23.680> go<00:04:28.349> now<00:04:29.349> there's<00:04:29.620> no<00:04:29.770> universal<00:04:30.639> rule<00:04:31.000> as

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
can go now there's no universal rule as

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.589 
can go now there's no universal rule as
to<00:04:31.719> how<00:04:31.900> best<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.349> do<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:32.860> what<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.639> tend<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.389> do

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
to how best to do this what I tend to do

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.600 
to how best to do this what I tend to do
is<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.469> mark<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:35.919> up<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.190> way<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.490> think

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
is to mark it up the way that I think

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.610 
is to mark it up the way that I think
it's<00:04:36.880> going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> work<00:04:37.300> give<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.139> try<00:04:38.349> and<00:04:38.409> if

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
it's going to work give it a try and if

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.969 
it's going to work give it a try and if
it<00:04:38.710> doesn't<00:04:39.010> work<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.430> try<00:04:39.969> different<00:04:40.180> settings

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
it doesn't work I try different settings

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.820 
it doesn't work I try different settings
let's<00:04:41.979> see<00:04:42.190> what<00:04:42.340> happens<00:04:42.669> now<00:04:43.000> best<00:04:43.960> also<00:04:44.320> not

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
let's see what happens now best also not

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.279 
let's see what happens now best also not
to<00:04:45.010> try<00:04:45.219> to<00:04:45.279> do<00:04:45.580> too<00:04:45.909> much<00:04:46.090> at<00:04:46.389> once<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:47.139> I'm

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
to try to do too much at once so I'm

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.190 
to try to do too much at once so I'm
gonna<00:04:47.440> grab<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.919> corner<00:04:48.719> and<00:04:49.719> I'm<00:04:49.870> just<00:04:50.050> gonna

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
gonna grab the corner and I'm just gonna

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.730 
gonna grab the corner and I'm just gonna
pull<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.740> over<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.159> see<00:04:51.520> what<00:04:51.669> happens<00:04:52.469> now

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
pull it over and see what happens now

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.969 
pull it over and see what happens now
as<00:04:53.860> soon<00:04:54.250> as<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.580> start<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.210> move<00:04:55.479> this<00:04:55.810> look<00:04:56.770> at

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
as soon as I start to move this look at

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.600 
as soon as I start to move this look at
what<00:04:57.250> PSC<00:04:57.969> is<00:04:58.120> doing<00:04:58.599> the<00:04:59.529> shores<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.279> the<00:05:00.580> lake

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
what PSC is doing the shores of the lake

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.700 
what PSC is doing the shores of the lake
and<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.240> lot<00:05:01.419> of<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.690> other<00:05:01.810> lines<00:05:02.110> are<00:05:02.409> same

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
and a lot of the other lines are same

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.760 
and a lot of the other lines are same
pretty<00:05:03.300> consistent<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:05.289> notice<00:05:05.740> that

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
pretty consistent and you notice that

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.399 
pretty consistent and you notice that
the<00:05:06.130> two<00:05:06.310> Bison<00:05:06.849> on<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.150> right<00:05:07.360> are<00:05:07.779> starting

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
the two Bison on the right are starting

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.170 
the two Bison on the right are starting
to<00:05:08.500> get<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.650> little<00:05:08.830> bit<00:05:09.159> closer<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.789> each<00:05:09.909> other

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
to get a little bit closer to each other

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.700 
to get a little bit closer to each other
now<00:05:11.139> if<00:05:11.289> i<00:05:11.409> stops<00:05:11.830> at<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:12.099> point<00:05:12.820> i<00:05:13.710> think

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
now if i stops at that point i think

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.200 
now if i stops at that point i think
that<00:05:15.070> still<00:05:15.490> looks<00:05:15.669> like<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.880> pretty<00:05:16.120> good

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
that still looks like a pretty good

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.810 
that still looks like a pretty good
picture<00:05:16.779> there<00:05:16.960> are<00:05:17.080> very<00:05:17.260> few<00:05:17.820> imperfections

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
picture there are very few imperfections

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.300 
picture there are very few imperfections
in<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.330> compared<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.080> original<00:05:20.169> as<00:05:20.889> you

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
in that compared to the original as you

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.440 
in that compared to the original as you
increase<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:23.130> what<00:05:24.130> starts<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:24.820> happen<00:05:24.909> is

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
increase this what starts to happen is

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.990 
increase this what starts to happen is
that<00:05:25.960> sort<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.409> effect<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:26.889> notice<00:05:27.370> there's

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
that sort of effect you notice there's

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.089 
that sort of effect you notice there's
virtually<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.510> crease<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.440> picture<00:05:29.979> at

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
virtually a crease on the picture at

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.769 
virtually a crease on the picture at
that<00:05:30.279> point<00:05:30.610> that's<00:05:30.820> probably<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:31.360> taking

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
that point that's probably just taking

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.219 
that point that's probably just taking
it<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:32.080> little<00:05:32.560> bit<00:05:33.039> too<00:05:33.340> far<00:05:33.669> if<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:34.750> stopped

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
it a little bit too far if I stopped

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.790 
it a little bit too far if I stopped
there<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.979> think<00:05:36.909> that's<00:05:37.210> pretty<00:05:37.539> good<00:05:37.659> and<00:05:38.050> let

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
there I think that's pretty good and let

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.019 
there I think that's pretty good and let
me<00:05:38.979> just<00:05:39.010> commit<00:05:39.700> that<00:05:39.849> confirm<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.840> and

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
me just commit that confirm that and

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.550 
me just commit that confirm that and
then<00:05:43.029> if<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.240> look<00:05:43.360> close<00:05:43.659> up<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:44.050> really<00:05:44.320> can't

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
then if I look close up I really can't

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.250 
then if I look close up I really can't
see<00:05:44.830> any<00:05:45.120> imperfections<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.630> at<00:05:46.779> all<00:05:47.020> and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
see any imperfections in that at all and

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.219 
see any imperfections in that at all and
I<00:05:47.770> have<00:05:48.070> closed<00:05:48.430> that<00:05:48.760> group<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.240> bison<00:05:49.930> up<00:05:50.050> by

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
I have closed that group of bison up by

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.350 
I have closed that group of bison up by
quite<00:05:50.289> a<00:05:50.500> reasonable<00:05:50.770> amount<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.940> course<00:05:52.150> this

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
quite a reasonable amount of course this

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.600 
quite a reasonable amount of course this
is<00:05:52.510> an<00:05:52.659> exercise<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.650> could<00:05:53.950> repeat<00:05:54.250> if<00:05:54.460> I

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
is an exercise that I could repeat if I

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.570 
is an exercise that I could repeat if I
wanted<00:05:55.029> to<00:05:55.240> if<00:05:55.779> you<00:05:56.050> do<00:05:56.590> get<00:05:56.830> any<00:05:57.099> sharp

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
wanted to if you do get any sharp

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.790 
wanted to if you do get any sharp
corners<00:05:57.700> which<00:05:58.240> does<00:05:58.510> sometimes<00:05:58.840> happen<00:05:59.229> so

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
corners which does sometimes happen so

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.589 
corners which does sometimes happen so
you<00:06:00.340> might<00:06:00.520> have<00:06:00.639> a<00:06:00.669> little<00:06:00.940> edge<00:06:01.150> maybe<00:06:01.479> a

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
you might have a little edge maybe a

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.360 
you might have a little edge maybe a
little<00:06:01.750> crease<00:06:02.289> in<00:06:02.529> a<00:06:02.620> fence<00:06:02.919> or<00:06:03.159> something

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
little crease in a fence or something

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.730 
little crease in a fence or something
like<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:04.539> can<00:06:04.719> normally<00:06:05.050> fix<00:06:05.289> it<00:06:05.529> with

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
like that you can normally fix it with
