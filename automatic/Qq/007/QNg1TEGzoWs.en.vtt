going to be on a post now this is going

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
going to be on a post now this is going
to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.090> different<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.509> normal<00:01:33.930> post<00:01:34.140> because

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to be different from normal post because

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.020 
to be different from normal post because
this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> boost<00:01:35.490> route<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this is going to be a boost route and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
this is going to be a boost route and
what<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> mean<00:01:36.659> by<00:01:36.720> boost<00:01:37.140> route<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
what I mean by boost route is if you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
what I mean by boost route is if you
watch<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> receiver<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.520> makes<00:01:38.700> his<00:01:38.820> cut

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
watch the receiver when he makes his cut

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
watch the receiver when he makes his cut
he<00:01:39.479> gets<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> speed<00:01:40.170> boost<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> creates<00:01:41.250> insane

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
he gets a speed boost and creates insane

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
he gets a speed boost and creates insane
separation<00:01:42.420> against<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> corner<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
separation against the corner if it is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.710 
separation against the corner if it is
our<00:01:44.340> main<00:01:44.610> coverages<00:01:45.149> boost<00:01:45.390> route<00:01:45.570> will

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
our main coverages boost route will

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
our main coverages boost route will
destroy<00:01:46.170> any<00:01:46.380> type<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> man<00:01:46.860> coverage<00:01:47.310> because

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
destroy any type of man coverage because

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370 
destroy any type of man coverage because
it<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> booster<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> corners

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it is a booster out and the corners

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
it is a booster out and the corners
cannot<00:01:49.680> keep<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> no<00:01:50.549> corners<00:01:50.970> can

cannot keep up with it no corners can
and<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> also<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.530> unbundle<00:01:53.220> as
