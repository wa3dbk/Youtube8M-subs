900<00:00:47.399> even<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.079> actually

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
900 even and this time I actually

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
900 even and this time I actually
haven't<00:00:49.680> sniped<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> basically

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

games<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.730> haven't<00:00:59.969> played<00:01:00.359> long

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
games and I just haven't played long

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
games and I just haven't played long
range<00:01:01.379> sniper<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> tried<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
range sniper that much but I tried to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
range sniper that much but I tried to
play<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.930> short<00:01:04.199> range<00:01:04.500> sniper<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
play some some short range sniper and to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
play some some short range sniper and to
have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> fun<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> sniper

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
have a little bit of fun with the sniper

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.679 
have a little bit of fun with the sniper
and<00:01:07.590> train<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:07.920> shorter<00:01:08.760> distances<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and train with shorter distances and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.530 
and train with shorter distances and
since<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.439> feel<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.820> country<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
since I feel that I kind of a country to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
since I feel that I kind of a country to
get<00:01:12.689> better<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:14.040> saying<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.400> pro<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
get better I'm not saying I'm pro but I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
get better I'm not saying I'm pro but I
can't<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.750> any<00:01:15.960> better<00:01:16.170> than<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.590> am

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
can't really get any better than I am

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
can't really get any better than I am
right<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.310> long<00:01:17.520> distances<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> maybe

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
right now with long distances and maybe

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
right now with long distances and maybe
when<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> comes<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> moving<00:01:19.979> target<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
when it comes to moving target and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
when it comes to moving target and
because<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.650> good<00:01:22.920> bitch<00:01:23.130> moving

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
because I'm not really good bitch moving

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.940 
because I'm not really good bitch moving
targets<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.960> least<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.650> they're<00:01:25.799> like

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
targets at least not when they're like

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.690 
targets at least not when they're like
really<00:01:26.130> far<00:01:26.490> away<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> guys<00:01:29.520> are

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really far away but I think you guys are

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
really far away but I think you guys are
gonna<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> ending<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.600> least<00:01:30.810> even

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
gonna like the ending at least even

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
gonna like the ending at least even
though<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.680> long-range<00:01:32.159> sniping<00:01:32.460> isn't<00:01:32.880> does

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
though the long-range sniping isn't does

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
though the long-range sniping isn't does
kick<00:01:33.299> asses<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.840> last<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:35.009> sure

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
kick asses the last one I will make sure

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
kick asses the last one I will make sure
key<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.880> place<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.420> long-range<00:01:36.720> sniping<00:01:37.530> for

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
key to place more long-range sniping for

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.609 
key to place more long-range sniping for
the<00:01:37.890> next<00:01:38.400> montage<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> change<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.439> up

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the next montage to kind of change it up

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.420 
the next montage to kind of change it up
so<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> isn't<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> XA<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.979> thing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so it so it isn't like the XA same thing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.039 
so it so it isn't like the XA same thing
every<00:01:44.790> time<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> boring

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
every time because it's kind of boring

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.160 
every time because it's kind of boring
to<00:01:46.500> watch<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.880> exactly<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> same<00:01:48.930> at

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to watch it if it's exactly the same at

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
to watch it if it's exactly the same at
least<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.090> don't<00:01:51.240> know

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
least that's what I think I don't know

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.960 
least that's what I think I don't know
