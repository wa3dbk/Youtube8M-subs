alright<00:00:07.540> let's<00:00:07.720> see<00:00:07.899> how<00:00:07.959> fast<00:00:08.200> this<00:00:08.410> baby

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
alright let's see how fast this baby

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.750 
alright let's see how fast this baby
really<00:00:08.950> is<00:00:09.099> we're<00:00:09.340> going<00:00:09.459> to<00:00:09.519> do<00:00:09.610> the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
really is we're going to do the

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.620 
really is we're going to do the
sunspider<00:00:10.330> test<00:00:10.690> right<00:00:10.900> now

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
sunspider test right now

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.630 
sunspider test right now
the<00:00:12.990> fastest<00:00:13.500> we've<00:00:13.650> seen<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.040> down<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.430> ARM

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:14.640 
the fastest we've seen this down on ARM

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.770 
the fastest we've seen this down on ARM
processor<00:00:15.090> so<00:00:15.330> far<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.720> around<00:00:17.090> 900<00:00:18.090> sorry

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
processor so far is around 900 sorry

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.810 
processor so far is around 900 sorry
nine<00:00:18.960> thousand<00:00:19.380> milliseconds<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.010> nine

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
nine thousand milliseconds so nine

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.900 
nine thousand milliseconds so nine
seconds<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:22.349> is<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> ipad<00:00:22.950> and<00:00:23.279> also<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
seconds which is the ipad and also the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.530 
seconds which is the ipad and also the
AC<00:00:24.390> 100<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.110> tick<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> device<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
AC 100 the tick go to device this is

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.030 
AC 100 the tick go to device this is
running<00:00:27.869> through<00:00:28.020> it<00:00:28.110> pretty<00:00:28.230> fast<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.009> runs

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
running through it pretty fast it runs

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.310 
running through it pretty fast it runs
through<00:00:29.279> three<00:00:29.790> times<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.540> then<00:00:30.989> we<00:00:31.110> should

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
through three times and then we should

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.190 
through three times and then we should
get<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.770> result<00:00:32.550> remember<00:00:32.940> android<00:00:33.360> 2.2<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
get a result remember android 2.2 is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.490 
get a result remember android 2.2 is
optimized<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.710> full<00:00:35.640> text<00:00:35.910> pause<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
optimized for full text pause so you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930 
optimized for full text pause so you
should<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> much<00:00:38.070> better<00:00:38.100> result<00:00:38.460> maybe

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
should get a much better result maybe

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.120 
should get a much better result maybe
two<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> three<00:00:39.360> times<00:00:39.630> faster<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> then

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
two to three times faster on this then

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.860 
two to three times faster on this then
on<00:00:41.280> android<00:00:41.840> 2.1<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.260> feel<00:00:43.470> for<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.739> already

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
on android 2.1 a feel for it already

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870 
on android 2.1 a feel for it already
trying<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> last<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.920> maybe

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
trying through for the last time maybe

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.180 
trying through for the last time maybe
even<00:00:48.120> less<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:49.110> five<00:00:49.350> seconds<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> going

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
even less only five seconds it's going

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.340 
even less only five seconds it's going
really<00:00:50.610> quickly<00:00:50.910> feel<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.080> racehorse

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
really quickly feel like a racehorse

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
really quickly feel like a racehorse

on the SunSpider test 7.52 sorry 7.5 to
second<00:01:38.550> us<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.300> fastest<00:01:39.870> arm

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
second us which is you the fastest arm

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.420 
second us which is you the fastest arm
device<00:01:40.890> we've<00:01:41.340> seen<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:41.820> far<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
device we've seen so far this is the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:02:03.220 
device we've seen so far this is the
quadrant<00:01:44.970> benchmark

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.059 

I

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.499 

Seamus<00:02:08.069> wiggle<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.550> pretty<00:02:08.819> good<00:02:09.000> that's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
Seamus wiggle that's pretty good that's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.490 
Seamus wiggle that's pretty good that's
not<00:02:09.690> bad<00:02:09.720> yep<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.920> looks<00:02:10.950> very<00:02:11.519> decent

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
not bad yep that looks very decent

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.940 
not bad yep that looks very decent
so<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.310> still<00:02:15.210> won<00:02:15.630> figure<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.710> is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so we still won figure it out if this is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.700 
so we still won figure it out if this is
an<00:02:17.340> ARM<00:02:17.670> Cortex<00:02:18.000> a9<00:02:18.560> from<00:02:19.560> might<00:02:19.740> be<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.130> age

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
an ARM Cortex a9 from might be in a age

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.060 
an ARM Cortex a9 from might be in a age
let's<00:02:22.710> see<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.870> books<00:02:25.080> Mary<00:02:25.350> dicen<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.920> was

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
let's see that books Mary dicen that was

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.400 
let's see that books Mary dicen that was
very<00:02:26.250> smooth<00:02:26.610> compared<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.140> saw<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
very smooth compared to when I saw the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.710 
very smooth compared to when I saw the
ticket<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.830> recently

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.810 

I<00:02:31.750> name<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.010> turning<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.670> good

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
I name is going to get turning a good

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.880 
I name is going to get turning a good
result

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.730 

bench<00:02:37.550> rob<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> wonder<00:02:38.420> proceed<00:02:38.720> hit<00:02:39.350> yes

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
bench rob is a wonder proceed hit yes

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.430 
bench rob is a wonder proceed hit yes
okay<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:45.270> above<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.630> galaxy<00:02:46.110> s<00:02:46.230> as

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
okay so in just above the galaxy s as

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.700 
okay so in just above the galaxy s as
expected<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.250> under<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.000> motorola<00:02:48.600> droid<00:02:48.810> x

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
expected just under the motorola droid x

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.380 
expected just under the motorola droid x
Tegra<00:02:50.580> 2<00:02:50.760> comes<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.960> about<00:02:53.060> fifty<00:02:54.060> percent

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
Tegra 2 comes in at about fifty percent

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.100 
Tegra 2 comes in at about fifty percent
more<00:02:54.900> powerful<00:02:55.410> overall<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.310> benchmark

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
more powerful overall on that benchmark

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.200 
more powerful overall on that benchmark
but<00:02:58.110> look<00:02:58.830> at<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.130> right<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.460> there<00:02:59.640> just

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
but look at it it's right up there just

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.730 
but look at it it's right up there just
above<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.480> galaxy<00:03:01.020> s<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:01.410> actually

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
above the galaxy s so that's actually

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.840 
above the galaxy s so that's actually
not<00:03:01.920> bad<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.370> all<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:04.370> about<00:03:05.370> twice<00:03:05.640> as

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
not bad at all and about twice as

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.800 
not bad at all and about twice as
powerful<00:03:06.030> as<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:07.320> nexus<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.340> result

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
powerful as the nexus one on that result

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:25.440 
powerful as the nexus one on that result
so<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.340> portrait<00:03:11.760> result<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:14.780> 1064

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.510
