ISO dial that relates to the film so you

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.580 
ISO dial that relates to the film so you
put<00:00:52.240> those<00:00:52.450> three<00:00:52.720> together<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.410> just

the shots from my little photo walk
around<00:01:08.380> my<00:01:08.560> place<00:01:08.880> they're<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:09.909> really<00:01:10.180> meant

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
around my place they're not really meant

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.990 
around my place they're not really meant
to<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.540> anything<00:01:10.810> terribly<00:01:11.409> artistic<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.250> just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
to be anything terribly artistic I just

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.030 
to be anything terribly artistic I just
wanted<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.270> make<00:01:13.390> sure<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.040> camera

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
wanted to make sure that the camera

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.520 
wanted to make sure that the camera
worked<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> way<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.610> supposed<00:01:15.820> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
worked the way it was supposed to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.360 
worked the way it was supposed to
unfortunately<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.770> see<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> little<00:01:18.190> bit

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
unfortunately you can see a little bit

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.750 
unfortunately you can see a little bit
of<00:01:19.260> vignette<00:01:20.260> around<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.159> edges<00:01:21.549> of<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
of vignette around the edges of the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.490 
of vignette around the edges of the
pictures<00:01:22.090> I'm<00:01:22.330> not<00:01:22.630> sure<00:01:22.900> if<00:01:22.990> that's<00:01:23.110> from<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
pictures I'm not sure if that's from the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.219 
pictures I'm not sure if that's from the
camera<00:01:23.860> itself<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.840> from<00:01:26.049> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
camera itself or from the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.740 
camera itself or from the
post-processing<00:01:26.650> machine<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.570> guess<00:01:28.570> that's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
post-processing machine I guess that's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.940 
post-processing machine I guess that's
what<00:01:28.870> I<00:01:28.900> get<00:01:29.020> for<00:01:29.320> going<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.070> Walgreens<00:01:30.280> huh

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.020 

one<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.100> few<00:01:36.280> negatives<00:01:36.670> about<00:01:36.789> this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
one of the few negatives about this

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.560 
one of the few negatives about this
particular<00:01:37.509> camera<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:39.310> uses<00:01:39.759> an<00:01:39.909> EPX

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
particular camera is that it uses an EPX

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.980 
particular camera is that it uses an EPX
625<00:01:41.409> battery<00:01:41.860> now<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.880> battery<00:01:43.240> originally

the modern batteries don't they kind of

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.160 
the modern batteries don't they kind of
drop<00:01:57.880> off<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.090> little<00:01:58.420> bit<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.689> voltage<00:01:59.020> over
