00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.960
 return your fears to a new video 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.330
 very very very important news too 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.429
 important I would say of the most 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.379
 important perhaps of the year I consider 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.570
 I consider it so the other thing 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.480
 consider yourself like that but good seems to be 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.510
 how good the president of konami 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.730
 has said the following good be I 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.599
 I think they have dug their own grave 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.039
 sincerely, I'm going to say it like 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.009
 I think it with me I think it's 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.750
 going from bad to worse more and more with the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.060
 dismissal with the dismissal of colima with 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.610
 actions that do not seem at all fair 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.200
 how to eliminate the pp to which we what 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.970
 can anyone else download people 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.640
 that has not downloaded, either 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.150
 cancel that land hills and then also 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.360
 since recently also a strike to a 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.430
 youtuber for talking about the topic about 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.200
 the possible dismissal of kojima that the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.090
 president because he had mania and everything 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.720
 this they put it out like this without a rush 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.020
 they are pam 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.410
 peace for your mouth we are not talking about 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.120
 censorship and perhaps over power 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.040
 we could talk and good 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 Today's declarations of konami are 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.090
 of the most important of the year for 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.970
 say they say that mobiles will be their 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.220
 basically new main platform 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.930
 they have said that they will not stop 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.040
 side neither metal gear solid 5 nor in the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.920
 next deliveries of pro evolution 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.950
 soccer but they're going to be very very very 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
 very very very limited in the games of 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
 consoles with this I mean it's 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.640
 we probably only see pro evolution 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.920
 soccer on consoles right now with me 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 is a mobile game developer 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.830
 that's how clear I am and it seems to me 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.180
 a total pity is honestly this 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.470
 what the president of adecco said 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.720
 nothing less than I 'm making it up is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.790
 the most pitiful in history 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 Sincerely, I feel very sorry and 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.720
 I hope he retract 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.750
 to retract quickly and say something 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.480
 about it because I think it's a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 fucking madness saying that good that follows 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.570
 the mobiles of full expansion but 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.580
 almost everyone has a mobile and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.140
 others and everything you want but I 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.410
 I do not find a future there 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.450
 develop games that really make you 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.130
 do the company or anything I think that at 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.390
 final that bubble is going to explode the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 everyone's mobile bubble the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.860
 He is exploiting and exploited others as 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.870
 the facebook and its games and all this 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 I do not know where he goes with ameal I do not know 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.340
 how to catch it or catch it but this is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.280
 making a mess or forgetting about 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.370
 see a 6 read hills soon or almost 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.070
 never, well, well, we do not talk about the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.980
 next daily metal we almost confirm 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.530
 that with kojima leaves the company and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 possibly because of these changes I do not 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.300
 I sincerely know, I do not know what's in store for us 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.459
 the e3 with this company or anything for the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.900
 style I do not understand it sincerely 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.480
 I believe that the world of videogames 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.090
 is changing in a very bestial way 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.350
 to me then it is all this roll I do not like 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.290
 honestly so nothing to another 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.930
 developer company that maybe 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.490
 because I mobile games because few 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 I do not have a cell phone with which 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.480
 for me to take for ass so nothing 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.750
 we go in the next video until the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 next
