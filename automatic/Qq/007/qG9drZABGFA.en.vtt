00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi to all these toys and today 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:13.410
 we will test a macro retina 13 pause 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:14.730
 2015 so maybe you know it 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.160
 until now I had a macbook pro 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 13 inch classic with cd player which 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.279
 dated from the end of 2011 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 and so since early 2010 that he bought 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.250
 I used that to make the chain 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.050
 youtube and everything is so it started 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.580
 a little bit to be present to use a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 computer old enough to create 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.429
 montages almost every day of which 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.960
 I told myself for the change to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.510
 computers and so I took a macbook 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 pro 13 inch retina of 2015 with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.750
 trackpad force I think this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 computer there is no need to do 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.120
 a big test on it because you know 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.290
 already what to expect 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.090
 besides, I already did a test of a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 macbook or repin at 15 inches this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 this time as to its release in 2012 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 but here it is in 2015 it is the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.840
 new version that I'm going to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 speak a little bit quickly his 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.079
 design is different from the old macbook 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.030
 pro ie that is more end more 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.070
 more powerful light ie 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 it's a core i5 my model is 1,256 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 giga ssd so this is the second 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.370
 model 13-inch models well 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 heard it on his screen retina which is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 beautiful here is the only screen that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.130
 I missed at home with a screen 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.950
 retina good except television but good 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.479
 that's normal in terms of screen of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.130
 every day that's the computer was 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.710
 the only screen that was missing as 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.659
 retina so I revisited completely with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.619
 this sublime screen when I used it I 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.479
 It hurts my eyes less 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.490
 it's a pleasure to use it's 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 really the must is also the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.970
 battery is magic on mabhouh pro 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 before he gave three hours in 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 normal use this one lasts six 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.460
 seven eight hours in use that's 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.479
 magically frankly I rev I have not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.040
 need the day to take my 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.170
 loader with me to use my mac 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 I leave at least 70% and in the evening a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 regulation it is 21% is perfect 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 frankly then we could have 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 expect when apple has renewed its 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 macbook pro range in 2015 to have a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.820
 little the design of the macbook that is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.060
 super end with the new keyboard here on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 always has the classic with touches 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 thicker than on the keyboard of the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.030
 macbook but especially we have a new 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.300
 forster trackpad that comes to him 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.150
 directly from us 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.100
 books and who comes to him from the apple 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.720
 watts so this chapero force trackpad 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.510
 does it serve it makes it possible to differentiate a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.430
 click of a taf and a strong support it is with 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.500
 to say that the click on the new macbook 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.910
 with the boring torso is enough 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 complicated to make this rostrum to two 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.420
 there is the first and there is the second on 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.490
 no longer strong and then it's a girl 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.960
 come out there are several cliques and more 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.820
 we press hard we will have ten clicks I 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.280
 believe it's like that and it's rather 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.390
 nice to like effect is for example 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.890
 you can use it for a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.050
 picture on the desk supporting you loudly 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.600
 above it will open the photo in a 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.220
 video you press hard on it's going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 fast forward a little bit less a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.330
 little less quickly and for example on 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.740
 a word or on a date or on a 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.670
 event click it's okay 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.470
 directly put it in your 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.910
 event of your calendar and that 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.680
 frankly it's pretty cool as 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.480
 little feature that saves a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 little crazy time that 's something 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
 which is really not bad on this match on 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.560
 waiting for it on the iphone 6 16 6 16 plus to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.510
 the start of the school year 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.130
 it could be not bad 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.900
 concretely it's the only novelty 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.820
 strong internship that ensures this macbook pro 13 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.170
 inches of 2015 I will not make you a 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.460
 benchmark nor anything because I got there 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.900
 do not know and I do not want to lose 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.400
 time in it for nothing at all 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.650
 think it does not interest you 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.239
 so much I'm very very 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.739
 happy with my macbook pro to me leaves 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.120
 in 13 inches why did I take a 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.930
 macbook pro and not an imac because 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.209
 I need a mac 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.489
 traveling to mach who is the homeland 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.870
 and a sufficiently powerful max so the 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.320
 best compromise was the macbook 13 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.480
 inch 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010
 because the 15 inch is too big and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.230
 far too expensive this concept of miro 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.090
 his relations very dear so here I 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.890
 think I did a little tour 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.080
 quickly from this new macbook pro 13 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.970
 inches I am relatively very very 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.709
 fans there now I have two matches and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.209
 I have 13 inches before and 13 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.070
 inches again the two will serve me 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.170
 no for example to check internet 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.610
 on the normal 13 inches and the second 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.500
 the 13-inch retina to make 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.690
 research a little more push of the assembly 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.340
 Video of the photo and other they all 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.810
 he's going to dedicate the 13 inches to fully 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.250
 the youtube channel and at work I 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.170
 do on the youtube channel and the other 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.940
 will be more for my personal life where I believe 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.470
 to be me all my life I would let go 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.780
 so it's quite a lot of 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.150
 differentiate 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.800
 big prints and the private so that's it 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.940
 tell me what computer you have 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.319
 at home because I question myself 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.740
 sometimes on subscribers what do they 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.180
 have at home 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.010
 what they call abou khair years my 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.520
 food or an imac or even if you are 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.290
 not at apple 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.610
 do you have a pc and a few 6 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.500
 use you let go in the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.390
 comments and we'll see which one is 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.310
 favorite left and at each of them 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.540
 So here you are, thank you all for having 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.889
