masking<00:00:29.640> tape<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> pen<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
masking tape you got a pen and then I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
masking tape you got a pen and then I
use<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.340> straightedge<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
use my this is my straightedge so I can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.940 
use my this is my straightedge so I can
get<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> his<00:00:34.260> toes<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> an

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
get it up to his toes and get an

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
get it up to his toes and get an
accurate<00:00:35.370> reading<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> length<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
accurate reading on the length of the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.299 
accurate reading on the length of the
foot<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:37.739> we're<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
foot so first thing we're gonna do is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
foot so first thing we're gonna do is
find<00:00:38.610> something<00:00:38.969> straight<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.020> Mike

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
find something straight that that Mike

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.889 
find something straight that that Mike
can<00:00:40.410> put<00:00:40.620> his<00:00:40.739> foot<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.070> against<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> he

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can put his foot up against and he

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
can put his foot up against and he
pushes<00:00:43.379> his<00:00:43.500> foot<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:44.010> back<00:00:44.280> he's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pushes his foot all the way back he's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
pushes his foot all the way back he's
gonna<00:00:44.700> lift<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.180> his<00:00:45.360> front<00:00:45.750> toes<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.770> gonna

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
gonna lift up his front toes we're gonna

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
gonna lift up his front toes we're gonna
put<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> tape<00:00:47.520> right<00:00:48.329> underneath<00:00:48.690> those<00:00:49.020> toes

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
put the tape right underneath those toes

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
put the tape right underneath those toes
so<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.550> an<00:00:50.640> accurate<00:00:50.789> reading<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> his

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so we can get an accurate reading on his

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
so we can get an accurate reading on his
longest<00:00:51.840> over<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.649> second<00:00:53.070> toe<00:00:53.100> here's<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
longest over the second toe here's a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
longest over the second toe here's a
little<00:00:54.059> bit<00:00:54.180> longer<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.629> his<00:00:54.780> his<00:00:55.350> big<00:00:55.620> toe

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
little bit longer than his his big toe

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
little bit longer than his his big toe
we're<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.489> bring<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> straightedge<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
we're gonna bring the straightedge in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.770 
we're gonna bring the straightedge in
here<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.879> nice

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
here you can see we're gonna get nice

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
here you can see we're gonna get nice
we're<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.230> pushing<00:01:01.680> those<00:01:01.829> toes<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.550> pushing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we're not pushing those toes not pushing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
we're not pushing those toes not pushing
it<00:01:03.030> hard<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.840> barely<00:01:04.320> touching<00:01:05.070> those<00:01:05.220> toes

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it hard just barely touching those toes

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
it hard just barely touching those toes
making<00:01:06.390> sure<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.869> parallel<00:01:07.140> again

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
making sure that it's parallel again

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920 
making sure that it's parallel again
with<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.549> brace<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.659> Mike's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
with this back brace here that Mike's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
with this back brace here that Mike's
got<00:01:10.170> his<00:01:10.200> heel<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.680> against<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.760> once<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.240> have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
got his heel up against so once we have

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
got his heel up against so once we have
that<00:01:12.420> parallel<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.740> barely<00:01:14.310> pushing<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> on

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that parallel just barely pushing it on

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
that parallel just barely pushing it on
there<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.439> accurate

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
there we're going to get an accurate

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.330 
there we're going to get an accurate
reading<00:01:17.240> okay<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.930> exactly<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.830> big

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
reading okay of what exactly that big

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
reading okay of what exactly that big
toe<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> marking<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
toe is we got a marking on there and you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.850 
toe is we got a marking on there and you
can<00:01:23.159> come<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:24.020> draw<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.500> firmer

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can come back draw a little bit firmer

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
can come back draw a little bit firmer
of<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> line<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.600> tells<00:01:27.930> us

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of a line in there and that tells us

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170 
of a line in there and that tells us
exactly<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.799> long<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.220> foot<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:29.970> from

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
exactly how long is foot is so then from

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
exactly how long is foot is so then from
there<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.350> before<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.979> actually<00:01:32.460> let's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
there but before we go actually let's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.840 
there but before we go actually let's
this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.240> great<00:01:33.479> foot<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.290> show

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
this is a great foot to actually show

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
this is a great foot to actually show
person<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> has<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> problem<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.140> with
