00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
also your Dean's connectors of course

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.380 
also your Dean's connectors of course
here's<00:02:21.690> one<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.020> already<00:02:22.350> has<00:02:22.620> holes<00:02:23.390> okay

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
here's one that already has holes okay

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.440 
here's one that already has holes okay
so<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.590> first<00:02:26.840> take<00:02:27.840> your

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
so what you want to do first take your

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.280 
so what you want to do first take your
your<00:02:30.450> clothes<00:02:30.959> pin<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.550> cut<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> straight<00:02:32.970> off

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
your clothes pin and cut it straight off

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
your clothes pin and cut it straight off
right<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.850> sand<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.150> down<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.450> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
right there you can sand it down if you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.800 
right there you can sand it down if you
want<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.140> even<00:02:37.430> better<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> want

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
want to get it even better what you want

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.900 
want to get it even better what you want
to<00:02:39.900> eat<00:02:40.020> what<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.650> drill<00:02:41.220> bit<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.490> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> use

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
to eat what is drill bit you want to use

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
to eat what is drill bit you want to use
is<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> 1/16<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:45.450> real<00:02:45.660> bit<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.110> that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is the the 1/16 it's real bit and that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.990 
is the the 1/16 it's real bit and that
is<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:48.510> one<00:02:48.570> right<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:49.520> mine<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.670> little

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
is this one right here mine is a little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.050 
is this one right here mine is a little
dark<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.080> think<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.410> had<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> little<00:02:53.520> friction<00:02:53.790> to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
dark I think it had a little friction to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.250 
dark I think it had a little friction to
kind<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.330> chart<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.050> that's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
kind of chart it a little bit that's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.460 
kind of chart it a little bit that's
fine<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.570> want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> do<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.110> take<00:02:58.290> your

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
fine what we want to do is take your

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.990 
fine what we want to do is take your
your<00:02:58.950> nail<00:03:01.100> want<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> take<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.400> wire<00:03:02.580> cutters

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
your nail want to take your wire cutters

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.210 
your nail want to take your wire cutters
and<00:03:03.560> cut<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.280> head<00:03:05.489> off<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:07.070> aim<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and cut the the head off here aim it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.199 
and cut the the head off here aim it
down<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> head<00:03:14.310> doesn't<00:03:14.670> fly

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
down so the so the head doesn't fly

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.070 
down so the so the head doesn't fly
around<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:20.450> put<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.570> down<00:03:21.750> and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
around so you do that put that down and

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.160 
around so you do that put that down and
then<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.750> take<00:03:25.230> your<00:03:25.260> your<00:03:26.070> drill<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
then you take your your drill bit the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.210 
then you take your your drill bit the
1/16<00:03:28.820> drill<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.180> hole<00:03:30.630> squarely<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.500> there<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
1/16 drill a hole squarely in there you

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.060 
1/16 drill a hole squarely in there you
know<00:03:32.340> directly<00:03:32.910> straight<00:03:33.810> down<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.590> both<00:03:34.920> of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
know directly straight down on both of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.580 
know directly straight down on both of
them<00:03:35.660> about<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:37.549> don't<00:03:38.549> know<00:03:38.700> about<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:40.260> deep

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
them about I don't know about that deep

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.030 
them about I don't know about that deep
or<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:42.680> do<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.620> do<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.920> you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
or so do that and what you do is you

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.780 
or so do that and what you do is you
take<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:48.510> want<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.750> use<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:50.280> end<00:03:50.459> with

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
take you want to use the the end with

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.440 
take you want to use the the end with
the<00:03:50.940> little<00:03:51.180> texture<00:03:52.820> on<00:03:53.820> there<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.239> want<00:03:54.390> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the little texture on there you want to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.509 
the little texture on there you want to
put<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.660> down<00:03:54.780> first<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.769> glue<00:03:56.280> has

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
put it down first so the glue has

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.729 
put it down first so the glue has
something<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.180> grasp<00:03:57.989> onto<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.350> take<00:04:01.560> two

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
something to grasp onto so you take two

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.789 
something to grasp onto so you take two
of<00:04:01.769> them<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:03.600> know<00:04:03.780> what<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.290> do<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.650> can

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
of them you know what you can do you can

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.699 
of them you know what you can do you can
before<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.730> glue<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:07.290> can<00:04:07.440> use<00:04:07.590> this

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
before you glue it in you can use this

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.800 
before you glue it in you can use this
to<00:04:07.950> gauge<00:04:08.900> take<00:04:09.900> one<00:04:10.110> out<00:04:10.230> for<00:04:10.500> now<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:12.690> can

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
to gauge take one out for now you can

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.680 
to gauge take one out for now you can
kind<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.049> gauge<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.959> all<00:04:16.560> about

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
kind of gauge it so all about

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.530 
kind of gauge it so all about
quarter<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.260> an<00:04:18.380> itch<00:04:18.910> exposed<00:04:20.080> like<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:22.540> you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
quarter of an itch exposed like that you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.830 
quarter of an itch exposed like that you
know<00:04:25.060> take<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.180> other<00:04:26.270> one<00:04:26.390> out<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:26.810> have

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
know take the other one out so you have

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
know take the other one out so you have
a<00:04:26.930> little<00:04:27.110> bit<00:04:27.320> program

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
a little bit program

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.890 
a little bit program
mmm<00:04:30.860> out<00:04:31.010> there<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:35.150> ones<00:04:35.390> somewhere<00:04:35.870> I

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
mmm out there that ones somewhere I

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.340 
mmm out there that ones somewhere I
don't<00:04:36.050> know<00:04:36.230> ah<00:04:37.780> that's<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.840> little<00:04:39.050> uneven

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
don't know ah that's a little uneven

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.210 
don't know ah that's a little uneven
well<00:04:39.950> you'll<00:04:40.250> probably<00:04:40.460> get<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> little<00:04:41.150> bit

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
well you'll probably get it a little bit

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.710 
well you'll probably get it a little bit
you<00:04:43.220> know<00:04:43.310> closer<00:04:43.730> but<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.390> just<00:04:44.540> for

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
you know closer but this is just for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.570 
you know closer but this is just for
demonstration<00:04:44.750> purposes<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:46.160> already<00:04:46.400> made<00:04:46.550> a

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
demonstration purposes I already made a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.390 
demonstration purposes I already made a
couple<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.750> I'm<00:04:48.560> not<00:04:48.680> gonna<00:04:48.830> put<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.130> glue<00:04:49.370> in

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
couple so I'm not gonna put the glue in

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.840 
couple so I'm not gonna put the glue in
it's<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:49.760> too<00:04:50.120> messy<00:04:50.690> right<00:04:51.020> now<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:51.980> say

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
it's just too messy right now so you say

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.600 
it's just too messy right now so you say
you<00:04:53.600> went<00:04:53.810> had<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.080> glue<00:04:54.200> glue<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.070> put<00:04:55.370> glue

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
you went had to glue glue that put glue

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.360 
you went had to glue glue that put glue
in<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:56.650> put<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.310> let's<00:04:59.210> dry<00:04:59.510> whatever

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
in and put it in and let's dry whatever

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.100 
in and put it in and let's dry whatever
and<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.460> have<00:05:01.520> your<00:05:01.730> Deans<00:05:01.880> connector<00:05:03.160> and

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
and you have your Deans connector and

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.510 
and you have your Deans connector and
also<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.680> course<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:07.010> use<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.270> 1/16<00:05:08.930> hole

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
also of course you use the the 1/16 hole

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.410 
also of course you use the the 1/16 hole
or<00:05:10.520> drill<00:05:10.910> bit<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.230> to<00:05:12.230> put<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.590> hole<00:05:13.420> squarely

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
or drill bit to to put a hole squarely

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.220 
or drill bit to to put a hole squarely
in<00:05:14.750> each<00:05:15.170> one<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.710> want<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:15.920> make<00:05:16.040> sure<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.550> go

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
in each one you want to make sure to go

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.740 
in each one you want to make sure to go
between<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.740> plugs<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.280> course<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:20.510> want<00:05:20.690> to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
between the plugs of course you want to

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.550 
between the plugs of course you want to
keep<00:05:21.170> them<00:05:21.410> from<00:05:21.650> hitting<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.910> tabs

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
keep them from hitting the the tabs

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.710 
keep them from hitting the the tabs
that's<00:05:24.560> really<00:05:25.130> really<00:05:25.310> important<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:28.720> this

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
that's really really important so this

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.350 
that's really really important so this
is<00:05:29.900> pretty<00:05:30.140> self-explanatory<00:05:31.120> get<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.240> in

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
is pretty self-explanatory get it in

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.730 
is pretty self-explanatory get it in
there<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.890> pop<00:05:33.890> it<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:36.230> course<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.530> didn't

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
there and pop it and of course I didn't

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.409 
there and pop it and of course I didn't
have<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.890> plugged<00:05:37.160> in<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:37.640> one<00:05:37.790> of<00:05:37.820> them<00:05:38.000> came

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
have a plugged in so one of them came

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.560 
have a plugged in so one of them came
out<00:05:38.540> whatever<00:05:39.790> what<00:05:40.790> you<00:05:40.880> want<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.120> do<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.450> you

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
out whatever what you want to do is you

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.870 
out whatever what you want to do is you
want<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.780> make<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:43.310> want<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:43.550> make<00:05:43.669> more<00:05:43.820> than

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
want to make you want to make more than

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.140 
want to make you want to make more than
one<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:44.690> as<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> backup<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:46.100> in<00:05:46.250> case<00:05:46.310> you

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
one just as a backup just in case you

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.190 
one just as a backup just in case you
lose<00:05:47.390> it<00:05:47.600> or<00:05:47.780> it<00:05:48.460> for<00:05:49.460> some<00:05:49.610> reason<00:05:49.640> breaks<00:05:50.200> so

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
lose it or it for some reason breaks so

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.220 
lose it or it for some reason breaks so
I<00:05:51.230> actually<00:05:51.650> have<00:05:51.919> two<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.400> bring<00:05:52.580> to<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:52.820> field

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
I actually have two I bring to the field

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.590 
I actually have two I bring to the field
because<00:05:54.230> it's<00:05:54.560> nothing<00:05:55.100> worse<00:05:55.280> than<00:05:55.600> then

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
because it's nothing worse than then

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.560 
because it's nothing worse than then
having<00:05:57.470> it<00:05:57.650> plugged<00:05:58.220> in<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.610> not<00:05:58.760> you<00:05:59.450> know

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
having it plugged in and not you know

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.420 
having it plugged in and not you know
having<00:05:59.870> your<00:05:59.960> thing<00:06:00.230> and<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:01.100> course<00:06:01.310> the

have<00:06:08.480> beens<00:06:08.690> connectors<00:06:09.169> all<00:06:09.740> right<00:06:09.890> so

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
have beens connectors all right so

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.870 
have beens connectors all right so
that's<00:06:10.190> about<00:06:10.490> it

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
that's about it

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.070 
that's about it

separator<00:06:16.040> now<00:06:17.050> isn't<00:06:18.050> that<00:06:18.140> awesome<00:06:18.290> so<00:06:19.130> I

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
separator now isn't that awesome so I

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.780 
separator now isn't that awesome so I
use<00:06:19.550> this<00:06:19.669> all<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:19.940> time<00:06:21.340> also<00:06:22.340> a<00:06:22.370> little<00:06:22.520> no

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
use this all the time also a little no

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.680 
use this all the time also a little no
of<00:06:23.060> course<00:06:23.270> you<00:06:23.480> don't<00:06:23.690> want<00:06:24.100> your<00:06:25.100> nail

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
of course you don't want your nail

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.840 
of course you don't want your nail
diameter<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.870> be<00:06:27.020> any<00:06:27.680> thicker<00:06:27.979> than<00:06:28.280> the<00:06:28.490> the

diameter to be any thicker than the the

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.230 
diameter to be any thicker than the the
1/16<00:06:29.570> and<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:30.380> don't<00:06:30.590> want<00:06:30.770> it<00:06:30.860> to

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
1/16 and you don't want it to

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.810 
1/16 and you don't want it to
you<00:06:33.110> know<00:06:33.199> thinner<00:06:33.500> than<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:33.770> because<00:06:34.370> you

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
you know thinner than that because you

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.240 
you know thinner than that because you
want<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.360> be<00:06:35.479> strong<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:35.990> not<00:06:36.410> bend<00:06:36.889> under

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
the the pressure you can also use

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.150 
the the pressure you can also use
something<00:06:41.270> other<00:06:41.540> than<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.960> nail<00:06:42.139> but<00:06:42.530> I<00:06:42.710> had<00:06:42.860> a

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
something other than a nail but I had a

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.070 
something other than a nail but I had a
bunch<00:06:43.430> of<00:06:43.550> nails<00:06:43.729> so<00:06:44.030> that's<00:06:44.449> what<00:06:44.630> I<00:06:44.660> use<00:06:44.900> this

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
bunch of nails so that's what I use this

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.560 
bunch of nails so that's what I use this
clipped<00:06:45.410> it<00:06:45.560> off<00:06:45.680> and<00:06:46.040> that's<00:06:46.580> what<00:06:47.120> I<00:06:47.150> did

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570
