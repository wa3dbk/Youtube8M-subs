00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 yes 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.290
 He said 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.779
 video analysis words clan words 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.990
 The words family has a history 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.550
 quite considerable that since 1995 we 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.349
 proposes a bitter battle between 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.540
 worm troops along the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.860
 years and the worlds deliveries was 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.539
 showing a series of improvements in the 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.180
 aesthetic section keeping the same 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.100
 addictive gameplay or tripping like the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.629
 infamous won esports and also many 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.309
 games derived from war worms 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.080
 but eventually the team guys 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.820
 seventeen had to understand that what 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.710
 that we all wanted was what always 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.300
 we had a worm gang 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.220
 distributing lead candies 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.530
 throwing grenades in the shape of a banana 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.870
 lashing out with explosive old ladies and 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.479
 basically letting us kill and kill 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.640
 of laughter together with our friends 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.500
 Clan words can be considered a copy 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.510
 made and right to revolution the game 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.190
 previous series maintains all 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.659
 novelties of his predecessor such as 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.460
 the four classes selectable for 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.110
 our worms the appearance of objects 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.760
 physical maps and the puddles of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.320
 dynamic water that we use 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.119
 ingenious ways to drown the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.409
 enemy or sweep those from their positions 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.810
 to throw them into the depths 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.030
 liquid the real big difference of 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.590
 clan words is to be an exclusivity of pc 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.000
 taking advantage of sting tools 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.560
 to ensure better service 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.520
 online game and a social section 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.409
 regrettable 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.329
 it was very difficult to corroborate this 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.890
 affirmation because at the time of 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.929
 write these lines the servers of the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.850
 game were empty most of the 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.829
 improvements go through the addition of a cycle 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.719
 day night in the levels the appearance of 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.880
 mechanical systems in some maps a 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.560
 light polishing and balancing system 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.420
 of classes and a couple of weapons editions 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.369
 new for our worms the aggregate 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.140
 more important however is that 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.819
 that gives name to the game the war of 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.009
 clans we can create our own 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.959
 clan together with friends or be part of 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.729
 one already created to compete and reach 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.409
 the top of the scorecards is 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.789
 an interesting idea that is seen again 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.259
 compromised by the little presence 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.700
 online from other players too 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.920
 we have a single player campaign 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.659
 in which the voice of Catherine Parkinson 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.670
 whom we will remember from haiti ground 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.349
 he plays tara ping the tom a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.000
 nice parody of lara croft that 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.259
 the narrator acts for the events that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.269
 will take place in the different 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 museum exhibitions a story that 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.660
 serves as excuses for the player 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.340
 go learn the basic commands and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.930
 the use of different weapons to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700
 more entertainment we have the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.500
 challenges work ops in which we are 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.970
 they impose missions based on the armament 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.799
 and specific equipment of our arsenal 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.970
 they are very interesting aggregates that 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.130
 They serve to sharpen our skills 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.510
 for the true main course that is 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.159
 certainly the multi 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.629
 and the number of options in this mode 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.159
 it remains plentiful and flexible 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.049
 allowing us to face from games 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.579
 short against friends in the same pc 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.079
 until the new matches with different 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.489
 artificial intelligence models that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.620
 It must be said that they are still 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.819
 terrifyingly accurate and lethal in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.799
 its highest levels 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.360
 warnes clone wars is an improvement of 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.099
 revolutions but suffers from the fact of 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.599
 have left so relatively close to 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.159
 previous game less than a year 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.970
 difference between both titles so 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.590
 that most players 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.510
 prefer not to make the jump to the new 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.340
 product and stay where you already 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.959
 they own the game keeps the old and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 dear formula that already proved to be a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.709
 success but the girl with those little details 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.840
 extra that they return to this product plus a 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.909
 caprice that a need if you plan 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 play it with at least one friend have 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.780
 Guaranteed fun 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.030
 the best makes some improvements 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.129
 regarding revolution maintains the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.150
 charisma of the franchise is still 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.519
 great to play with friends the worst 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 game servers are usually empty 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:32.540
 does not innovate practically nothing regarding 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:35.719
