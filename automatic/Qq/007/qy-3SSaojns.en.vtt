00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.090
 my love here is one of the 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.050
 Body kits and today I will give you the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.180
 Show the healthiest of the world and it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.980
 is really super easy everything 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 we need today is one 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 sweet potato some olive oil best 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.090
 Of course, first wishes squeeze 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.560
 and a bit of salt and pepper as 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
 first step would have your first 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.100
 sweet potatoes wash it well 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.899
 I have done now but not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.770
 steal because we let the skin off 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.879
 and you will need such a dealer 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.190
 who it see here really very, very 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.210
 gossamer slices create some people 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 We also rather than before court 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.899
 but mine is now so just look 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 that she finds something like that but you can 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.910
 Of course, even if he did not do that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.739
 Just have something like this 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.290
 Here at home so regulate that you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.380
 Sometimes asking over it would ask 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 no perfect chips and mine 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 device is not the best either 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 for this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.790
 but it's really okay if this is here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.030
 so small thin slices are the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.100
 thinner the better actually and then 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 would be the right crisp chips now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 we do all that is natural 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.470
 You do not really have to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.430
 the potato chips without nothing in the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 do oven 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.460
 I only do it for those now 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 of you a little more 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 tasteful I take it now so grasp 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 a tablespoon of olive oil and earlier that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390
 everything is beautiful 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.250
 not mainly off for that me 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.150
 Low salt now have to do either 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.920
 a bit of pepper 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:59.370
 so you also stop a bit 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 win on the apache well then take 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.360
 I do it all 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 is with me now after an hour rob 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.590
 and now my chips are ready for you 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.110
 Of course it always has to be a bit 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 Watch how the chips are when we are 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.200
 it could be very thin now 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.580
 have to go shorter so you have to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.660
 always have to be close to that 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.660
 stop oven 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.580
 These are my finished chips that will be 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.989
 Of course, at some places 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
 but a little bit brown are not yet 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.650
 black so if you are wondering 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.660
 especially those friendlier ones 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.430
 are called very nice crisp and me 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.470
 I am particularly tasty vincent 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.120
 marquis think they have one right 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 nice shape with these each 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 different they know from the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.959
 small and as you can see they are too 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.480
 really crisp and like such a small one 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.310
 chip has so I find these chips 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.050
 really great as taste of course 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.300
 not quite normal potato chips because 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 there are now sweet potato chips though 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.350
 for they really mega and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.739
 Nutrition and I like to eat it 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.370
 with mine that it is now a shopping market 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.049
 you were linked to this here 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.360
 above 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.140
 I've already turned it off 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.690
 a bit ago 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.060
 the left one does not want to know yet 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.570
 Great recommendation and together that is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.610
 really a great meal for in between 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.110
 just type a bit with that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.110
 chip fondant 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.660
 the field tastes good I have you 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.070
 now a little bit the nutrition 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.230
 written down for some of this 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.550
 I'm interested in a whole 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.180
 taken potato that is not now 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.410
 the whole but a very big highest 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.120
 pair and pack a whole mark for 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.370
 the djp of course you can also salsa 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.370
 Take tip or block a mole if you 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.020
 Vegans are perhaps overtaking everything 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.570
 what the heart desires but I have now 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.840
 just play 500 grams of lean quark 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.640
 and that adds up to five grams of fat 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 and I even have one already 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.300
 tablespoon of olive oil when added 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.959
 You let it go even less 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.590
 fat 16 grams of chaos that beats the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.080
 burgheimer and 65 are doing really well 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.300
 also for muscle building and against 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.300
 only 500 kilocalories
