00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 yes 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.670
 or those who are Latvian as you are well 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.320
 I'm ready for a new video today 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.360
 this has come to me with prints 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.800
 I bought an express law and he called me 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.570
 much attention when I saw it by the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.640
 networks and the truth is that I wanted to have a 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.989
 big print but it's not gold all 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.430
 what reduces in seal comes accompanied 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.110
 of two giant scrapers 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.180
 the first thing that I 've ever 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.940
 realized when you have it in your hands is that 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.820
 the rubber has a shiny coating that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.700
 completely covers and that is not good 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.860
 to stamp the one that must do a lot already 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.200
 you know what I tell you that type of layer 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.570
 gelatinous that covers it there 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.170
 scrape it off so that the seal 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.170
 shelf better 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.640
 let's see how it prints 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.430
 at the time of collecting the painting is 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 doing tests doing more pressure and 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.100
 less pressure even without the plastic 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 put and as you can see it's not very 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 precise when collecting the enamel 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.610
 I do not know if it 's that they touch me 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.740
 Chinese but to the 2 scrapers that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 they came included in the set they do not clean 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 very well the drawing of the plate 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.720
 half adventure say that I think the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.330
 problem with this pattern is that it has 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.099
 the rubber extremely hard to my that to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.989
 the time to stamp is a subject that I do not 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.690
 like since when the tires are 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.500
 excessively hard do not go well to the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.500
 Cuticle area 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.240
 now if I do not feel disappointed 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.790
 because I'm going to use this pattern 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.160
 to stamp the largest site and to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 do manual labor because in plane 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.150
 works very well 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.270
 good girls summarizing I think it's the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.230
 first time I have something between the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.480
 claw and well not me of the width also os 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.100
 I do not look good story that will sarandÃ­ 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 keep doing tests with him because I 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.680
 would get the most good game 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.840
 Well, I leave you so if you absorb the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.730
 video for purchases do not forget the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.990
 right above and of course what 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.980
 you pass very well 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.980
 goodbye
