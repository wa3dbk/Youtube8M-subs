00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 welcome to this new video where 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.230
 we will go to see the components for 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.560
 assemble a gaming PC with a budget 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 of about 800 euros 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 well as we can see I spent 800 2 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.939
 â‚¬ that the 60 is like a first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 component I chose a keys from 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.070
 corsa or the car wash pec 03 a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 excellent that the second event 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.469
 frontally Juventus is in the part 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 upper is a fan in the part 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.540
 rear 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 well this that support skimmed in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.980
 atx and mini itx format is a great caze 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.930
 from good material to even a cash 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.390
 windowed indeed as I motherboard 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 chosen a motherboard in right format 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 or the gigabyte h 97 m of 3h is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 excellent chipset- based motherboard 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:08.010
 h 97 which as we can see as a slot 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 as connectors to two usb 2.0 4 usb 3.0 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.280
 7.1 audio system in HD port 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 ethernet lan hdmi and vga wight is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.049
 a ps2 press excellent motherboard 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.159
 based on socket 1156 made ours 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:35.180
 professor is also based on socket 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.619
 1156 is an intel i5 4460 therefore 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.159
 belonging to the unsuo ray family 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.640
 flash is one of the best processors 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.520
 In fact, incoming is a quad core with 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.100
 speed of 3.2 gigahertz not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 it won't disappoint you being great 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.710
 processor to cool this down 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 processor and not a cabile trademark 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.689
 I chose a small sink 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.429
 dimensions or a heat sink of the 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:10.239
 cooler master hyper tx3 evo is based 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:14.260
 also supports socket 1156 what 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.870
 we are interested in it is great heat sink 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.599
 quite quiet and very easy 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.400
 assembly to feed ours 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.980
 configuration I chose this 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.310
 power supply or the ter martek berlin 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.440
 from 630 also 80 plus certificate will have 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.349
 an efficiency of around 80 82 per 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.819
 one hundred and with the capacity of 630 watts e 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.810
 enough will feed ours 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:47.170
 configuration as we were chosen these 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.870
 ram of the Corsair leve ganz races 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.910
 informed the profile so not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.269
 will hinder our sink 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.459
 these are two 4 gigabyte modules in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.329
 so take advantage of the dual channel have 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.630
 a frequency of 1600 makers and one 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.450
 casanova latency as a mass memory 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.560
 chosen and star disk the western digital 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.530
 terabyte caviar blue with 7,200 rpm 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.260
 or revolutions per minute and a great one is a 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.269
 great artists with excellent speed but 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.329
 combined with this disc also chosen 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.480
 these ssd of the crew already a former center 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.400
 with the capacity of 128 gigabytes has 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.310
 excellent reading and reading speeds 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.590
 writing in this ssd we will not go 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.440
 install the operating system 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.090
 naturally 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.530
 what programs you prefer so as to 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.950
 open them about 10 times more 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.330
 fast than classic allardyce 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.490
 finally in conclusion he could not miss 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.650
 that the video card one of the parts more 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.570
 important for a gaming PC 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.840
 this video card or the mdr 9 285 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.250
 resumes shakespeare and uses as you do 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.110
 it is cooling 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.510
 the alix duo a good system of 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.540
 cooling in this card 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.480
 video based on tonga and ha architecture 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.410
 in fact, excellent efficiency 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.510
 consuming little has excellent performance 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.500
 as we can see in fact in games 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.270
 as titan fall and aset ai with settings 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.210
 higher we can have an average of 49 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.700
 fps like games like heavy enough 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.280
 which as you know as a blink ft4 a 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.310
 details over 2 full hd solution 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.810
 we have an average of 46 fps with drops 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.169
 up to 36 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.020
 not bad tf in the game tf we will succeed to 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.740
 have an average of 50 fps with drops up 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.230
 to 31 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.310
 instead with other games like weapon iii 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.580
 we will have 49 fps of media or as assassin's 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.340
 creed black flag and we will have 55 well 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.160
 fps of media finally playing like 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.130
 screams autosport is a game of 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.180
 Racing simulation we will have almost 60 fps 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:12.050
 average to finish watchdog if it will be a 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.940
 48 fps of medium and strong network at 46 fps 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.470
 with drops up to 39 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.800
 so we saw how all the games 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.930
 heavier than the next gen 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.470
 and are not supported with them at least 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.600
 45 50 if not 60 fps of average with drops 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.310
 up to 40 50 for some games 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.100
 so this will be really good 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.530
 pc because it will be based on a processor 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.570
 intel among the best in particular 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.330
 inter the five of the best beautiful 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.590
 gaming ambit will have an excellent card but 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.450
 in a moment video card 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.190
 and since it is a video card of that 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.530
 uses enough architecture 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.850
 recent and has excellent efficiency 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:00.480
 also it will be a PC that will allow 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.750
 to be renewed and just change 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.300
 between 2 3 years and a video card for 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.310
 have top performance again 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.960
 well for this video is everything if there is 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.390
 liked it when you leave a mi 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.000
 like for not losing the next decrees 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.900
 to the channel and if the video was useful to you 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240
 left like 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.520
 furthermore for any doubtful opinion 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.670
 opinion suggestion do not hesitate to 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.670
 to comment
