00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
which is one of the one of the classes

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.280 
which is one of the one of the classes
in<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:18.950> series<00:00:19.430> while<00:00:20.330> I<00:00:20.360> was<00:00:20.630> still<00:00:20.869> racing

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
in the series while I was still racing

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.950 
in the series while I was still racing
IndyCar<00:00:21.770> full-time<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:22.730> I<00:00:23.000> kind<00:00:23.510> of<00:00:23.570> dipped<00:00:23.840> my

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
IndyCar full-time so I kind of dipped my

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.540 
IndyCar full-time so I kind of dipped my
toe<00:00:24.019> in<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.619> beginning<00:00:24.740> but<00:00:25.189> it's<00:00:25.340> always

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
toe in in the beginning but it's always

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.550 
toe in in the beginning but it's always
been<00:00:25.699> something<00:00:25.910> that<00:00:26.090> I've<00:00:26.359> known<00:00:26.869> about<00:00:27.080> and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
been something that I've known about and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.800 
been something that I've known about and
had<00:00:27.980> only<00:00:28.160> gotten<00:00:28.460> more<00:00:28.730> curious<00:00:29.210> about<00:00:29.330> over

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
had only gotten more curious about over

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.450 
had only gotten more curious about over
the<00:00:29.929> years

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.510 

my<00:00:37.060> driving<00:00:37.420> style<00:00:37.720> both<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:38.950> and<00:00:39.310> off<00:00:39.490> the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
my driving style both on and off the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.630 
my driving style both on and off the
track<00:00:39.880> are<00:00:40.120> very<00:00:40.330> similar<00:00:40.660> I<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:42.370> know<00:00:42.460> I'm

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
track are very similar I you know I'm

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.880 
track are very similar I you know I'm
relatively<00:00:43.480> aggressive<00:00:43.930> but<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.530> would<00:00:44.710> say

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
relatively aggressive but I would say

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.760 
relatively aggressive but I would say
I'm<00:00:44.950> more<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.400> a<00:00:45.550> more<00:00:46.510> calculated<00:00:47.230> aggressive

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
I'm more of a more calculated aggressive

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.800 
I'm more of a more calculated aggressive
and<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.550> know<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> don't<00:00:48.940> just<00:00:49.330> stick<00:00:49.570> my<00:00:49.750> nose

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
and you know I don't just stick my nose

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.390 
and you know I don't just stick my nose
in<00:00:50.230> if<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.440> don't<00:00:50.620> think<00:00:50.739> it's<00:00:50.920> going<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.220> work

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
in if I don't think it's going to work

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.760 
in if I don't think it's going to work
so<00:00:51.790> it's<00:00:52.570> about<00:00:52.690> being<00:00:52.840> smart<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.410> setting<00:00:53.680> up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
so it's about being smart and setting up

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.860 
so it's about being smart and setting up
passes<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.430> sometimes<00:00:54.790> it's<00:00:54.970> about<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.750> know

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
passes and sometimes it's about you know

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.780 
passes and sometimes it's about you know
putting<00:00:56.140> pressure<00:00:56.470> on<00:00:56.800> someone<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.550> make<00:00:57.760> a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
putting pressure on someone to make a

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.240 
putting pressure on someone to make a
mistake<00:00:58.239> or<00:00:58.540> or<00:00:58.960> just<00:00:59.290> change<00:00:59.590> lanes<00:00:59.949> on<00:01:00.220> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
mistake or or just change lanes on the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.490 
mistake or or just change lanes on the
road<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.730> get<00:01:00.820> out<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.059> my<00:01:01.180> way<00:01:01.360> so<00:01:01.500> they're

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
road and get out of my way so they're

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.359 
road and get out of my way so they're
very<00:01:02.710> similar<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.710> know<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.860> think<00:01:09.009> that

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
very similar you know I think that

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.850 
very similar you know I think that
rituals<00:01:10.000> or<00:01:10.360> superstitions<00:01:11.140> or<00:01:11.410> things<00:01:11.710> that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.260 
and you know I think that's when it I
think<00:03:46.580> that's<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:46.880> things<00:03:46.910> are<00:03:47.210> really

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
think that's when things are really

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.670 
think that's when things are really
successful<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:48.020> when<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.320> really<00:03:48.440> get<00:03:48.620> into

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
successful is when you really get into

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.200 
successful is when you really get into
it<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.280> when<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.520> when<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:49.910> put<00:03:50.120> yourself

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
it and when you when you put yourself

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.130 
it and when you when you put yourself
into<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.930> little<00:03:51.020> bit

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:08.690 

I<00:04:06.170> had<00:04:07.170> never<00:04:07.470> been<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> video<00:04:08.430> game
