00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.630
 Jojo into the gravel bed or what is going on people 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 and here we are 42 now 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.400
 I do not know you so well anymore 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.949
 Form America had to be back now 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.760
 neat 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.289
 neat back to training 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.539
 but I said okay in there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 ski now I'll pick you up once again the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 into the law has made far what has 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.750
 continue next but tell me 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.570
 What are you doing now ? 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 I want to miss is clearly the mass 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.450
 people for summer back I said yes 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 I want to define myself and so on 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.930
 a little bit done is definitely 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 but still very clear whether the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.219
 mass that needs to be built up and there 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.789
 a little something needs to be changed 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.000
 when I say I already have a few 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.640
 things that we can change at 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.020
 minsky we can improve 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.590
 but how does the power go so fast 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.930
 so in terms of force, it is warm with me 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.280
 So the legs is okay with the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 I have partially upper body 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 difficulties I do not know if it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.619
 maybe also on the split plan lays 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.900
 I just got it once 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.100
 pretty much the triceps, so to speak 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.100
 has used hard and then at 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 shoulder press a bit off shit 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.810
 but it's actually going pretty well 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.869
 but there could definitely be more 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:31.920
 and, well that's make it just 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 look whiskey personally what just there 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.409
 so it's always important to know what 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 do you want to reach 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.759
 that 's what i always say clear goal 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.759
 to have in mind what we can do 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.210
 okay but that's right you understand 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.770
 do not know what you want then there is 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.940
 no way there without without great 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.680
 arrest 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 so clearly so far we do not want to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.509
 that eats too fat and what do we do 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.440
 Well, I'll be fine for now 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.940
 Of course it will look 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 Looked if the training will be changed 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.209
 next we have to look at the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.120
 Reminder and as a next chance 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.730
 Things like sleeping in ski like 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.430
 he feeds otherwise so has the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 micronutrients he has all the markus then 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.190
 Next , let's see how they are 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.320
 School like you with the stress 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.769
 It looks like at what times ever 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.180
 train how long he trains he does 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.040
 Really implement what I tell him 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.880
 and and and and and for example the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.880
 things that are important 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.510
 I already had a few things where I am 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.850
 think what his problems could be 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.220
 That's why I've been wondering why 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.260
 me too but what are you thinking now 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.030
 So technically upper body 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.380
 is a bit behind what do you want 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.269
 now specifically for example in the upper body 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 So you really want to change what you want 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:03:04.220
 you want to look what you definitely want 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.350
 I definitely wider 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.329
 shoulders spread my breast both 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.459
 oberhof especially what is to come so 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.630
 she looks 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.630
 So there is still a lot going on 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.290
 So people write your weak spots 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.989
 in the comments 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.280
 my back now I have to too 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.730
 now here again neat 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.730
 build up 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.780
 I have to build up again 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.970
 Neat, look down what 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.049
 I have your problems then I look 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 which can help 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.280
 we'll see you cha cha 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.470
 more
