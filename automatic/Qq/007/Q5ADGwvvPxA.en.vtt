00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello, I welcome you to daily life 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.660
 number six ought to do it 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.429
 hot olmos daily life because the last 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.740
 three days , unfortunately, no episode came 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.080
 but that was not me it was in the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 fall to youtube because youtube he has in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 blacks like a problem that way so that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.430
 all the videos I've uploaded a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.380
 had black screen 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.130
 that means I have it two or more 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 I'll have three episodes left 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 So someday uploading can be wondering 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.149
 not if somehow there when I'm there 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 something says what confuses you okay 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.700
 but now will definitely be back 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.160
 every day a video is coming and we are now 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.899
 tough call of duty ghosts here today 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.789
 we play a bit free 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 and I try here with the shotgun 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.550
 something to tear 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 ok where it seems right next to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.820
 to be with me there where the things are here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.440
 can go down the stairs ok perfect 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.629
 so the spot so the sports are always 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.729
 here in the back and on the other side 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.720
 so are they, I have to come 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.610
 watch me nothing 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
 go out because of the distance 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.320
 I of course with the shotgun nothing 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.909
 white okay that's right rehearse in that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 you afterwards and better is different 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.950
 the shotgun looks good in the gut 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.540
 so overwhelmed and because I still have some 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 ask yes how do you actually think big 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 yes I do not know me somehow 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 find guest is already so hot of things 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.500
 but somehow it makes the game 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.119
 somehow not so I think it does 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.790
 we were not that fun 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.860
 Parents call of dutys just more fun 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.310
 but that's just how I like the game 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 cool how it works and everything 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 works because, for example, black ops 2 im 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.340
 Comparison that just grabs around there 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 Sometimes I can not shy away from you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.369
 is invited or if you have someone 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 invites you to the lobby war nevertheless 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.979
 the distance from the boat quite nicely 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.330
 violently 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.750
 you see it also the distance old 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:11.480
 that's so blatant so we pick you up too 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:19.330
 No, I'll go get it! 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:25.000
 but not fast away what the fuck 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.870
 Pass was just the whole semtex 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.250
 he somehow has a hack analysis old 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:39.769
 lord of the whole wall dyed black 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.860
 okay, there are still some good as well 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.860
 now 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.560
 I think I'm sick already 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.850

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.440
