starts to recognize it and then suddenly

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.069 
starts to recognize it and then suddenly
your<00:02:38.560> flow<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.670> like<00:02:39.880> now<00:02:40.090> he's<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.569> good<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
just it's so beautiful i'm sure it takes

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.500

time<00:02:42.579> to<00:02:42.609> get<00:02:42.850> there<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.209> looks<00:02:43.389> like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
time to get there but it looks like

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
time to get there but it looks like
slow-mo<00:02:44.139> martial<00:02:44.530> arts<00:02:44.709> i<00:02:44.769> guess<00:02:44.950> that's<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
slow-mo martial arts i guess that's the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.340 
slow-mo martial arts i guess that's the
resistance<00:02:46.000> requires<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.810> isometrically

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
resistance requires like isometrically

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.840 
resistance requires like isometrically
training<00:02:47.769> your<00:02:47.859> muscles<00:02:47.889> increasing<00:02:48.760> your
