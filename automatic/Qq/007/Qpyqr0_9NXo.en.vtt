00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
there has been some question as to

there has been some question as to
whether<00:00:12.120> these<00:00:12.719> cars<00:00:13.170> are<00:00:13.500> actually

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
whether these cars are actually

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.220 
whether these cars are actually
waterproof<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.719> looked<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.109> the

I'm not worried about they say they want
waterproof<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.149> believe<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.780> however

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
waterproof and I believe them however

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.670 
waterproof and I believe them however
they<00:00:51.510> did<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.649> special<00:00:53.280> motor<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:55.440> go

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
they did not make a special motor to go

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.849 
they did not make a special motor to go
with<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.730> waterproof<00:00:57.329> electronics<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with the waterproof electronics and I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
with the waterproof electronics and I
looked<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.640> care<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.180> motors<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
looked at the care for motors and as it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
looked at the care for motors and as it
turns<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> new<00:01:02.340> instruction<00:01:02.940> manuals

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
turns out in the new instruction manuals

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020 
turns out in the new instruction manuals
there<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> section<00:01:04.379> called<00:01:04.880> driving<00:01:05.880> your

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
bearings it says increase your frequency

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.230 
bearings it says increase your frequency
of<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.919> following<00:04:53.370> maintenance<00:04:53.910> things

after running in water and it says

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.790 
after running in water and it says
cleaning<00:04:56.970> your<00:04:57.060> motor<00:04:57.710> cleaning<00:04:58.710> your

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
cleaning your motor cleaning your

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.600

transmission<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.790> cleaning<00:05:00.210> your<00:05:00.300> bearings

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
transmission and cleaning your bearings

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.200 
transmission and cleaning your bearings
so<00:05:02.610> if<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.720> were<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.110> lot<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.500> water<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.210> it

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
so if you were in a lot of water and it

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.990 
so if you were in a lot of water and it
was<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.570> dirty<00:05:07.140> water<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:08.610> might<00:05:08.760> want<00:05:08.940> to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000

was like dirty water you might want to
clean<00:05:09.150> all<00:05:09.300> your<00:05:09.330> bearings<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.050> I'd<00:05:10.440> say

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
clean all your bearings and I'd say

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.180 
clean all your bearings and I'd say
especially<00:05:11.040> your<00:05:11.370> motor<00:05:11.990> traxxas<00:05:12.990> says<00:05:13.260> you

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
especially your motor traxxas says you

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.159 
especially your motor traxxas says you
only<00:05:14.340> need<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.760> clean<00:05:14.970> your<00:05:15.090> motor<00:05:15.360> every<00:05:15.870> 10

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
only need to clean your motor every 10

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.590 
only need to clean your motor every 10
to<00:05:16.200> 15<00:05:16.800> times<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.790> brother<00:05:18.060> bought<00:05:18.300> motor

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
to 15 times my brother bought motor

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.700 
to 15 times my brother bought motor
cleaner<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:20.330> his<00:05:21.330> said<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:22.260> clean<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.620> every

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.490 
three runs so pick your number the more
the<00:05:26.070> better<00:05:26.100> I'd<00:05:26.520> say<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.570> when<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.139> went<00:05:28.380> in

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
the better I'd say so when I went in

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.219 
the better I'd say so when I went in
water<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:29.040> took<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.030> transmission<00:05:30.540> apart<00:05:30.840> that

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
water I took the transmission apart that

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.020 
water I took the transmission apart that
was<00:05:31.410> fine<00:05:31.710> but<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.100> just<00:05:32.310> wanted<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.640> check<00:05:32.850> it

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
was fine but I just wanted to check it

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.750 
was fine but I just wanted to check it
plus<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.450> had<00:05:33.540> never<00:05:33.630> taken<00:05:33.870> apart<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.950> Magnum

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
plus I had never taken apart the Magnum

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.030 
plus I had never taken apart the Magnum
transmission<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:37.169> that<00:05:37.410> was<00:05:37.530> interesting<00:05:38.330> I

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
transmission so that was interesting I

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.469 
transmission so that was interesting I
took<00:05:41.040> off<00:05:41.220> some<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.640> bearings<00:05:42.000> soaked

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
took off some of the bearings soaked

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.920 
took off some of the bearings soaked
them<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.690> wd-40<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:45.289> I<00:05:47.390> cleaned<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.539> bearings

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
them in wd-40 and I cleaned the bearings

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.510 
them in wd-40 and I cleaned the bearings
on<00:05:49.110> my<00:05:49.500> motor<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:51.260> I<00:05:52.260> cleaned<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.039> sand<00:05:53.280> off

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
on my motor and I cleaned the sand off

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.810 
on my motor and I cleaned the sand off
all<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.880> plastic<00:05:54.870> parts<00:05:55.190> that's<00:05:56.190> about<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:56.460> I

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
all the plastic parts that's about it I

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.480 
all the plastic parts that's about it I
didn't<00:05:57.750> really<00:05:57.840> do<00:05:58.050> too<00:05:58.080> much<00:05:58.350> more<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.860> to<00:05:59.340> my

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
didn't really do too much more and to my

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
knowledge all of its still functioning

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.310 
knowledge all of its still functioning
correctly<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:03.390> don't<00:06:03.690> have<00:06:03.840> it<00:06:03.960> with<00:06:04.080> me<00:06:04.140> right

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
correctly I don't have it with me right

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.710 
correctly I don't have it with me right
