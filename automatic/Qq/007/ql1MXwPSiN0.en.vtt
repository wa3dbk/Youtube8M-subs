00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.859
 you dear channel subscribers 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.520
 viewers sitting new project 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.090
 stronghold crusader he pass all 50 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.500
 plot-related maps 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.070
 let's talk about the game in general is 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.890
 hit this one hundred percent hilda classic 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.980
 for all the strategies i'm sure that many 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.130
 of you have played all enjoyed playing already 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.260
 start reseda here you grumble eat 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.899
 way instead of but wake up the original 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.399
 I do not know the way of the crusader 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.190
 how many episodes have I spent 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.190
 plan to do it in the floor so spedra 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.350
 not mode this when most simple 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.989
 cards pass very quickly difficult 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.710
 maps are sorted out in more detail into one 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.770
 in the first part two cards will come then two 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.960
 missions give arrival and it will be like 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.729
 Well, perhaps we will begin, perhaps we will 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 we start the game here we see 4 by 2 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.750
 thousands we have an advantage on money 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.369
 playing against the sultan tired weak 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
 the enemy is generally easy to defeat 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.710
 they all have different castles different different 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.510
 types of warrior and in general something against them 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.550
 quite different strategies are used 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.530
 fight you sultan wolf rat 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.600
 however participants in the game let's start 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.820
 for starters, we will immediately reduce the speed to 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.830
 at least until you see it goes down with it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.780
 game speed will increase the map to 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.940
 see with us since you see on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.160
 the general screen is immediately visible all 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.170
 practically the map and the first thing we do 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.260
 create a camp of mercenaries 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.330
 fast passing this siege card 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.520
 mamba is racist and will not build yet 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.040
 some apple trees something else built 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.490
 only the most necessary three houses are 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.670
 so that people quickly people quickly 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.790
 we appeared near the fireplace I quickly 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 us as a creation of people went units then 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.500
 most importantly knead squad lush 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.360
 absolutely will not need archers and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.290
 spearmen who keep this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.800
 lord our main thing here we are further 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.590
 will do 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.660
 Well, in principle, at least built with something 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.570
 you can only build a market here it is 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.190
 weed on the market we can do everything 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.760
 the truth here we will not need anything 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.310
 stone eat sell wood all sell 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.310
 not enough tree is the base set number 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:46.030
 four to four gasoline checkbox for 4 here 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.260
 this paragraph before Wait aspen 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.090
 take out quite parallel we increase 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.400
 speed of the game is already possible to raise more 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.690
 music is not enough river it can also 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.620
 cavalry 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.230
 huddled in principle office at dawn and not 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 missing the first chapter is enough to hire 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.209
 just assassins and send in principle 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.209
 into battle the message from the sultans are not 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.230
 now we will go all assassins at once 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 let's go up I have such a complex range 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:35.300
 I am meeting 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.300
 heavy infantry but lord too 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.750
 here and so easily passed the first mission 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.760
 next mission 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.659
 traversed in a similar way here 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.879
 indicated statistics on how many were killed 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.549
 when did it happen losing money 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.980
 how many who in general managed to do for 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.849
 lead time from this battle 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.400
 give the following next mission this 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.330
 hike we will play against caliph i 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.610
 I already know it beforehand 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.760
 here are 2 by 2 thousand here in general how 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.580
 would be compared even before but pass this 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.020
 the map is also very easy 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.920
 we start immediately speed rewind on 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.510
 At least a card we will turn a little 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.280
 to make it easier to otite our lord you 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.040
 you can immediately take the lead story in 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.020
 side of the caliph here he is his castle well 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.370
 developing on the same principle all 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.790
 make at least three houses 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.400
 market this build here it is the market we have 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:44.900
 what else do you need Moscow 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.420
 barn let's warehouse it still not here 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.680
 place the minutes here everything is absolutely 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:55.430
 the same thing we really lack trees 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.110
 we sell wood we hire samsara pashka 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:06.050
 these instruct money hires rica so 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:10.660
 these rasnimay care these do not break 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.660
 lack of reputation we increase the course of the game 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:19.040
 as much as possible the sender and the king himself and everything 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.050
 in principle, this should be enough to send 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.260
 all this 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:28.100
 assassins cavalry to lord territory 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.500
 we are attacked here already see yes 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.490
 Meet me actively just in case 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.490
 sent his lord if you handle 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.490
 lifeguards 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:57.139
 I think they did it right there 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:59.180
 won a second victory all this very 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.300
 quickly the principle is passed first 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.830
 there are no problems 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.009
 the country described will take place already in 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.619
 the next chapter is different let's say 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.349
 so the chapter is the previous two there for us 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:15.289
 will have to develop and act there 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.180
 against two caliphs as far as i know 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.969
 there will be up to 2 caliphs but we still have 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 there is an ally richard well ally is 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.069
 the only way to be honest rear and protects 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.539
 not bad but in terms of being there 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.300
 attack and so on well purely for 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.939
 support pants actually here 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.520
 the main problem will be some sort of us 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:36.800
 will try to set fire and a while 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.039
 raids and from the side of here is the cropper with 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.159
 the jackal and we we will do first 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.659
 queue later and destroy scorpions 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.449
 we will act strictly on tactics 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.790
 first create well I arc and so 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.800
 I plan what I will do first 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.760
 arbaletchikov they are generally not bad 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 such to support Richard I will put him 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.190
 on the tower so that she actively fought off 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.660
 Khalifa the scorpion himself will create well 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.750
 probably the infantry will create a few 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.660
 catapult and send the jackal's side I'm 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.340
 that it is dangerous and enough about 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.180
 the opponent has her choral with oil as 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.120
 like belebey neutralize and the shooting range then you 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.640
 already attacking these units 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.870
 but it will be all the arrows of the second chapter of the feet 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.080
 but you for the news until all will give 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.080
 only
