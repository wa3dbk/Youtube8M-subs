/ booster pump that we installed Phil

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.900 
/ booster pump that we installed Phil
and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.710> installed<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.310> there's<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:17.670> water

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
and I installed it there's our water

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.210 
and I installed it there's our water

out<00:00:55.910> let<00:00:56.910> another<00:00:57.870> copper<00:00:58.320> Union<00:01:00.440> goes<00:01:01.440> up

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
out let another copper Union goes up

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
out let another copper Union goes up
across<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> back<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.270> into<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> shutoff<00:01:08.450> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
across and back in into a shutoff and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
across and back in into a shutoff and
over<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.950> from<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.530> section<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.220> got

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
over here from this section here we got

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
over here from this section here we got
another<00:01:14.369> check<00:01:14.909> valve<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.509> again<00:01:15.780> not<00:01:16.740> pumping

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
another check valve so again not pumping

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.170 
another check valve so again not pumping
water<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> city<00:01:17.909> system<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.460> our<00:01:20.909> last

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
water into the city system and our last

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
water into the city system and our last
piece<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.810> we've<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:23.509> T&amp;P<00:01:24.509> valve<00:01:24.770> off<00:01:25.770> we

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
piece there we've got a T&amp;P valve off we

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
piece there we've got a T&amp;P valve off we
can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.439> lights<00:01:28.439> pretty

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can see it here with the lights pretty

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.569 
can see it here with the lights pretty
bright<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> TMP<00:01:29.970> valve<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:31.189> 100<00:01:32.189> psi

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
bright but got a TMP valve at a 100 psi

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.890 
bright but got a TMP valve at a 100 psi
so<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.659> blow<00:01:33.780> anything<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:36.630> our

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so we don't blow anything up that's our

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.550 
so we don't blow anything up that's our
install<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.920> works<00:01:38.460> pretty<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:39.350> looks<00:01:40.350> like

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
install so works pretty good looks like

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.580 
install so works pretty good looks like
it's<00:01:41.119> not<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> guess<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.380> we're

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's not on right now I guess but we're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
it's not on right now I guess but we're
at<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:46.110> 30<00:01:46.820> pounds<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> pressure<00:01:48.200> um

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
at right about 30 pounds of pressure um

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.420 
at right about 30 pounds of pressure um
well<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> guess<00:01:50.729> once<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> falls<00:01:51.479> below<00:01:51.840> like

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
well I guess once that falls below like

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.039 
well I guess once that falls below like
28<00:01:53.430> 30<00:01:53.670> pounds<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.270> thing<00:01:54.479> should<00:01:54.689> kick<00:01:54.869> on

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
28 30 pounds that thing should kick on

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.209 
28 30 pounds that thing should kick on
and<00:01:55.130> boost<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.579> 40<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.030> 50<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.219> that's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and boost it to like 40 or 50 so that's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
and boost it to like 40 or 50 so that's
it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.659 
it
you
