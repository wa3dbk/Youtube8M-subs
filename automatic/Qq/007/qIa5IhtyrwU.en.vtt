00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.200 
super super cheap so that helped me out
a<00:01:06.170> lot<00:01:06.440> like<00:01:06.829> coffee<00:01:07.189> filters<00:01:07.640> are<00:01:07.789> nothing

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
a lot like coffee filters are nothing

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.029 
a lot like coffee filters are nothing
the<00:01:08.450> hardest<00:01:08.869> part<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.320> project<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
the hardest part of this project is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.010 
the hardest part of this project is
probably<00:01:10.420> separating<00:01:11.420> all<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.810> coffee

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
probably separating all the coffee

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560 
probably separating all the coffee
filters<00:01:12.500> from<00:01:12.710> each<00:01:12.920> other<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.520> if<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:14.450> do

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
filters from each other so if you can do

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810 
filters from each other so if you can do
that<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:15.110> you're<00:01:15.350> good<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.770> go<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.219> I<00:01:16.460> hope

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
that then you're good to go so I hope

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:44.300 
that then you're good to go so I hope
you<00:01:17.000> enjoy<00:01:17.299> this

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 

so<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.299> step<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.020> making<00:01:46.229> this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so your first step to making this

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.850 
so your first step to making this
decoration<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.510> some<00:01:48.960> water<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.650> put

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
decoration is to take some water and put

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.580 
decoration is to take some water and put
it<00:01:50.010> in<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.310> spray<00:01:50.670> bottle<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.510> then<00:01:51.990> add<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it in your spray bottle and then add a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.240 
it in your spray bottle and then add a
heap<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.729> food<00:01:53.940> coloring<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.950> a

heap of food coloring like in just a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.490 
heap of food coloring like in just a
small<00:01:56.520> amount<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> water<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> used<00:01:57.690> almost<00:01:58.140> half

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.860 
with the color water mixture so just
make<00:02:39.930> sure<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.440> fully<00:02:40.830> saturated<00:02:41.870> with

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
make sure it's fully saturated with

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.789 
make sure it's fully saturated with
color<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.680> water<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:49.320> then<00:02:50.220> once<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
color and water and then once you have a

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.259 
color and water and then once you have a
stack<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.829> them<00:02:54.890> then<00:02:55.890> we're<00:02:56.070> gonna<00:02:56.220> go<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
stack of them then we're gonna go on to

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.120 
stack of them then we're gonna go on to
step<00:02:57.540> two<00:02:57.840> which<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.110> drying<00:02:58.650> them<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
step two which is drying them in the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.750 
step two which is drying them in the
oven<00:02:59.459> I<00:03:00.320> preheated<00:03:01.320> my<00:03:01.650> oven<00:03:01.769> until<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
oven I preheated my oven until the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.020 
oven I preheated my oven until the
lowest<00:03:03.120> setting<00:03:03.510> which<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.959> 170<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.250> I'm<00:03:05.790> just

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
lowest setting which is 170 and I'm just

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.600 
lowest setting which is 170 and I'm just
gonna<00:03:06.209> take<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> silicone<00:03:08.220> baking<00:03:08.400> mat

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
gonna take this is a silicone baking mat

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.699 
gonna take this is a silicone baking mat
because<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.540> baking<00:03:09.989> sheets<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.380> little<00:03:10.620> bit

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
because this baking sheets a little bit

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.729 
because this baking sheets a little bit
greasy<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.959> I'm<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.230> gonna<00:03:13.380> take<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
greasy but I'm just gonna take the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.020 
greasy but I'm just gonna take the
coffee<00:03:13.980> filters<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.880> sprayed<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:17.030> just

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
coffee filters that I sprayed and just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.910 
coffee filters that I sprayed and just
lay<00:03:18.269> them<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.870> mat<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.440> doesn't<00:03:19.829> even

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
lay them out on the mat it doesn't even

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.380 
lay them out on the mat it doesn't even
matter<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:20.760> they're<00:03:20.940> stuck<00:03:21.180> together

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
matter really if they're stuck together

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.150 
matter really if they're stuck together
because<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.230> pull<00:03:22.440> them<00:03:22.590> apart<00:03:22.709> once

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
because you can pull them apart once

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.069 
because you can pull them apart once
they're<00:03:23.340> dry<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:24.299> as<00:03:24.510> long<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:24.900> they're<00:03:25.049> all

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079

fully saturated with the food coloring
and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.670> finish<00:03:30.120> dip<00:03:30.329> these<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> oven

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and then finish dip these in the oven

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
and then finish dip these in the oven
make<00:03:31.739> sure<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.100> keep<00:03:32.250> an<00:03:32.400> eye<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.850> because

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
make sure you keep an eye on it because

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810 
make sure you keep an eye on it because
you<00:03:33.780> don't<00:03:33.959> want<00:03:34.170> burnt<00:03:34.530> coffee<00:03:34.980> filters

going to create a tiny hole right beside
the<00:04:17.450> staple<00:04:18.730> your<00:04:19.730> next<00:04:20.120> step<00:04:20.360> will<00:04:20.720> be<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.799> cut

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
the staple your next step will be to cut

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.670 
the staple your next step will be to cut
off<00:04:22.970> whatever<00:04:23.870> size<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:26.210> string<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.410> want

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
off whatever size of a string you want

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.370 
off whatever size of a string you want
to<00:04:27.950> put<00:04:28.190> your<00:04:28.520> pom-poms<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.270> what<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.780> used<00:04:30.140> is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
to put your pom-poms on what I used is

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.040 
to put your pom-poms on what I used is
some<00:04:30.590> yarn<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.100> had<00:04:31.400> lying<00:04:31.640> around<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.360> I

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
some yarn that I had lying around and I

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.860 
some yarn that I had lying around and I
used<00:04:33.500> about<00:04:33.620> twelve<00:04:34.340> feet<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.660> think

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
used about twelve feet of it so I think

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.140 
used about twelve feet of it so I think
you're<00:04:36.140> 12<00:04:36.440> feet<00:04:36.710> should<00:04:37.040> span<00:04:37.340> whatever<00:04:37.790> room

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
you're 12 feet should span whatever room

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.030 
you're 12 feet should span whatever room
if<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.900> know<00:04:39.140> what<00:04:39.380> room<00:04:39.620> you're<00:04:39.740> gonna<00:04:39.830> be

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
if you know what room you're gonna be

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.680 
if you know what room you're gonna be
hanging<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.850> can<00:04:40.970> obviously<00:04:41.360> go

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
hanging it in and you can obviously go

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.380 
hanging it in and you can obviously go
test<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.980> see<00:04:43.130> how<00:04:43.280> long<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.700> need<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:43.910> as

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
test to see how long you need it as

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.000 
test to see how long you need it as
you're<00:04:45.290> going<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.830> feed<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.780> yarn<00:04:48.080> through

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
you're going to feed the yarn through
