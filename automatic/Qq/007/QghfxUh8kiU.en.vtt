00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 hunting a hungry pigeon line 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.880
 nice all the guys based pieces on the 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.830
 my channel we returned with bombicci 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.060
 guys but today we are not here for ibase 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.320
 review but we are here because I found 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.499
 ammerman at level 60 per hour 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 in the last video and I remind you that in 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.619
 comments like because it had been 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.810
 also published on facebook in the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.279
 official page of boom bicitalia e 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.829
 I had read the comments, too 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.269
 people with written to but that scarce has it 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.489
 found at level 52 ie I don't 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.210
 I know however in the sense I find it at 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.980
 level 52 because to me of the radar of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.280
 I couldn't care less to find a standard 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.140
 blessed minchia then warriors level 18 and 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 so there is not in the enhanced sense 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.160
 first the attack but find again not in accordance with 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 I was interested, however, if people say that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.879
 you are scarce because of the 613 medals a 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.730
 level 53 and find andermann at level 5 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.470
 at level 55 52 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.530
 in short, it is their business but not there 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.520
 it interests however we go to attack 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.230
 also because I don't do it to see 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.300
 that to show that I am strong, that is 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.030
 I don't care if you think I am 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.260
 strong or less absolutely that is if you 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.970
 like the video well if you don't like it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.190
 having looked at another channel in the sense 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.920
 so here we see a little 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.180
 then then I was thinking from 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.840
 What part to go here are really there 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.780
 lots of mines the problem is that if there 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.760
 I do then try to do so 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 let's get rid of these mines here we hope that 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.280
 beaks also grandeur that also caught 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.300
 the one there exploded on a 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.150
 Here we pull away these stands and the ok 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.010
 perfect fabrics then i'm point to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 rally we launch here we do 1 and 2 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.220
 ok perfect we let them all down 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.840
 here and we do so perfect now 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.670
 we will have to stay with the energies too 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.730
 because after the bottom and that is there is not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.270
 really almost nothing to shock 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:17.849
 in the op op sense 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.220
 ops ok perfect in theory c or as good 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.700
 they hit an avalanche anyway 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.840
 I would say that we will have to do it from his 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.380
 launching 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.350
 ok perfect by the lance no I didn't have 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.170
 the more the ok, nothing I did not have 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.330
 more energy from the gunship for 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 pull the shock bomb but as you see 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.660
 went down very easily 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.190
 it would take much more energy than 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.019
 gunboat then at this point for one 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.420
 than maybe the most level warriors 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.489
 low, however, a hand was defeated e 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.090
 now to change tactics just build 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.970
 enough today then it will be practically 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.620
 who says that you are going to attack too 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.530
 if he is already attacking me eh eh eh 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.690
 fluffy ammerman these things do not 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.220
 they do however you are my advice is 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.880
 however always pass that way 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.459
 of from the right side and trying to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.739
 have many pops 6 heal level a little 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.910
 lower at least have a little more than 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.430
 career energy I obviously 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.410
 I had warriors at level 18 was one 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.060
 go for a walk on the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.230
 beach along with a little dog is a 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.060
 beautiful damsel 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.500
 so guys for this video is everything 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.560
 I hope you enjoyed it there 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
 useful for when you find it 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.070
 if so you have seen leave me 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.170
 like who you go to the channel if you live going 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.120
 even eating chocolate pudding 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.130
 if it is also the one we receive in 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.130
 next video fought peace house
