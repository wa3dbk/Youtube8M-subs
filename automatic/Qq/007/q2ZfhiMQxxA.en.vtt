00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.279
 in one of the most wooded counties 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.230
 bavaria produce the nürnberger land 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.939
 we use wood from the renewable raw material 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.939
 electricity and heat 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:35.800
 Join us on the path of the wood 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:37.719
 from soon to the power plant the team of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.089
 roland köhler a regional 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.730
 Forest entrepreneur shows us the impact 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.829
 of beech and spruce logs and the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 provision of the resulting 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 energy products and wood 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 at the previous with colored dots 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.550
 marked trees will be the first 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:03.769
 subsequently determined 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:05.990
 Fall care cut out according to the true 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.060
 call completion verschnitt to the tree 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.060
 tilts and falls to the ground 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 then the so-called forest bath 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.010
 the intended break bar from the trunk 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 away 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.380
 the precious part of the city is relaxed and the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.580
 Crowns share the later energy wood 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.259
 Separates the management of 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 forests in germany regulate some 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.150
 strict forest law and the so-called 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 Generation contract which states that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 also subsequent generations of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 forest owners a equal or 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.170
 draw higher benefits from their forests 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.539
 can 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.000
 as the current manager the 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.340
 lower branches remain to preserve the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 nutrient household in the forest after 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 Cut the stem woods, the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.170
 higher quality assortments on sale 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.750
 piled up after that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.670
 forest farmer the crowns of the trees especially 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.560
 When it comes to fruits it is important that everything 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.660
 for the pest bark beetle breed 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.630
 daily material from the forests 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.030
 will be removed after eight hours 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.280
 hardest physical work 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.950
 packed the tools and it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.950
 begins the well-deserved evening of celebration 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.570
 many forest areas of the nürnberger land 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.700
 lie on steep terrain here 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.489
 if special machines for the harvested 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.260
 used this rope excavator is taking off 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.840
 the steep slopes forests often urgently 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.940
 a care requires the harvested wood 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.870
 and the crown material to the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.870
 forest road 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.230
 then it becomes so-called 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 rumbling the back cover 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610
 sort the logs by length and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.900
 quality only the inferior wood 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.900
 lands in the heating plant 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.040
 in energy wood, it is important that the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.290
 crowns always parallel to each other and with 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.710
 the thick end to the forest path to lie 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.710
 come 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 then this material is from 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.140
 powerful mobile hackers too 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.110
 processed chips 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.850
 it can be up to 60 cm thick 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.040
 parts of the city are crushed 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.110
 the energy expenditure for this is 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.900
 less than 10 percent of the energy 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.940
 contents of wood in frame of a 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.010
 we use sustainable business 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.630
 only on the better soon against the sg 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.480
 and crown on the nutrient-poor 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.270
 locations this material remains 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.530
 completely in the forest with it is the 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.530
 nutrient cycle guaranteed 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.200
 farmers commissioned by the forest owner 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.880
 transport the chips 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 drag and special because of the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.370
 nearest heaters with a maximum of 30 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.160
 kilometers of transport from the forest 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.920
 in a heating plant the slogan wood is 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.490
 short paths ensured by the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.390
 coordinated acts of forest owners 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.430
 forestry community and regional 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.440
 wage earners will remain full 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.440
 Added value in our region 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.350
 in the power plant, the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.810
 weighed and chopped into the 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.849
 Reservoir bunkers are introduced to our 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.979
 sustainable forestry that is 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.630
 we only harvest the maximum amount of wood 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.030
 as well as regrow 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.819
 Let's give forest enterprises a crisis 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.770
 independent regional low-priced 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.780
 and renewable fuel for the 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.410
 the desired energy turnaround on all sides 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.630
 disposal 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.919
 On top of that can be our heat and 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.259
 leaving electricity customers 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.120
 how reliably environmentally friendly and 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.889
 financially affordable oil and 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.759
 gas deliveries in the future are 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.229
 against it uncertain 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.970
 that's what our team of forest stands for 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.509
 service company nürnberger land and 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.599
 the naturenergie a hersbruck 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.849
 this heat source never disappears 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.650
 forestry companies will continue to do so in the future 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.380
 for sufficient raw material and 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.789
 at the same time for naturally rich species 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.789
 beautiful world
