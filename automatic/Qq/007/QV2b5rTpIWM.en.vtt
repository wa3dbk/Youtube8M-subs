 ray is there on it reserve document so 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.620
 also a movie where he got the script 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.300
 had written quotes 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.100

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.470
 if she looks funny she looks great 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.680

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.270
 euro on blu-ray on amazon the absolute 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.460

 You can get this box together with 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.530
 a card to date so that could be 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.800

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.660

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.830

 for django unchained that is quasi 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.460
