00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
underneath okay so what I did was took
all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.879> plastic<00:00:45.360> piece<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
all the the plastic piece for the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:01:03.619 
all the the plastic piece for the
cupholder<00:01:00.410> gap<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.359> that<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> can

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
cupholder gap right there that you can

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.300 
cupholder gap right there that you can
just<00:01:03.899> loop<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.470> wires<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:08.130> would

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
just loop your wires and then it would

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.390 
just loop your wires and then it would
come<00:01:08.750> inside<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.170> center<00:01:10.710> console<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
come inside the center console or the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.859 
come inside the center console or the
phone<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.439> come<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.799> there

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
phone like this so would come in there

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
phone like this so would come in there
and<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.619> put<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> LED<00:01:20.640> strip<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.270> on

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and I just put the LED strip right on

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.469 
and I just put the LED strip right on
the<00:01:21.689> front<00:01:22.080> side<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> console<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:24.119> reason

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the front side of the console the reason

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.010 
the front side of the console the reason
I<00:01:24.570> chose<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> front<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.840> from<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I chose on the front because from the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
I chose on the front because from the
top<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.590> can't<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
top you can't really see them so this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
top you can't really see them so this
way<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.290> blinding<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.400> anything<00:01:32.640> when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
way is not blinding or anything when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.590 
way is not blinding or anything when
you're<00:01:33.090> looking<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.630> things<00:01:33.900> inside<00:01:34.409> your

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
you're looking for things inside your

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.749

dome<00:02:48.030> lights<00:02:48.300> also<00:02:48.720> led<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
dome lights also led the back and the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.680 
dome lights also led the back and the
cargo<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.320> also<00:02:52.709> LED<00:02:53.100> as<00:02:53.220> well<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.330> found

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
cargo is also LED as well so I found

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.240 
cargo is also LED as well so I found
this<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:55.080> map<00:02:55.380> with<00:02:55.500> metal<00:02:55.890> piece<00:02:56.100> right

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
this little map with metal piece right

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.600 
this little map with metal piece right
here<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.550> don't<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.820> what<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:58.610> just

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
here I don't know what it is but I just

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.780 
here I don't know what it is but I just
put<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.810> negative<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.220> put<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
put the negative in here and put the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.979 
put the negative in here and put the
screw<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.540> tighten<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:06.330> sounds

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
screw on to tighten it so it sounds

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.440 
screw on to tighten it so it sounds
perfectly<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:09.530> or<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.190> wire<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.120> ran

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
perfectly and or the wire that I ran

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.310 
perfectly and or the wire that I ran
from<00:03:12.810> underneath<00:03:13.400> -<00:03:14.400> there<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:15.570> one<00:03:15.780> this

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
from underneath - there this one this

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.850 
from underneath - there this one this
wire<00:03:16.590> I'm<00:03:17.580> getting<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.090> positive<00:03:18.630> from<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
wire I'm getting the positive from the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.720 
wire I'm getting the positive from the
fuse<00:03:20.190> box<00:03:20.459> inside<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.330> glove<00:03:21.570> compartment<00:03:22.730> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
fuse box inside the glove compartment I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.670 
fuse box inside the glove compartment I
put<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.810> tap<00:03:25.049> into<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.620> radio<00:03:26.480> fuse<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:28.380> every

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
put a tap into the radio fuse so every

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.360 
put a tap into the radio fuse so every
time<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.010> turn<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.489> key<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.030> ACC<00:03:30.739> or<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
time you turn the key to ACC or to the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.670 
time you turn the key to ACC or to the
on<00:03:32.519> position<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:33.299> light<00:03:34.170> what<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:35.610> well

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
on position the light what go on as well

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.199 
on position the light what go on as well
it's<00:03:37.680> automatic<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.549> don't<00:03:39.000> need<00:03:39.060> any

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
it's automatic so you don't need any

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.509 
it's automatic so you don't need any
switch<00:03:39.540> or<00:03:39.690> anything<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.650> that's

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
switch or anything like that so that's

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.370 
switch or anything like that so that's
what<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:44.130> have<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.540> wire

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
what I like so I have so for this wire

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.500 
what I like so I have so for this wire
right<00:03:49.410> here<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.670> positive<00:03:51.180> right<00:03:51.360> here

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
right here for this positive right here

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.310 
right here for this positive right here
let's<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:51.950> four<00:03:52.950> more<00:03:53.340> strip<00:03:54.330> this<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.110> for
