Star Wars games the old Lego games the
sports<00:02:39.739> games<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.760> really<00:02:41.090> old

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
sports games but like the really old

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.489 
sports games but like the really old
ones<00:02:41.389> like<00:02:41.750> 2000<00:02:42.590> 2003<00:02:43.510> all<00:02:44.510> those<00:02:44.840> even<00:02:45.349> the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:45.499 
ones like 2000 2003 all those even the

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.640 
ones like 2000 2003 all those even the
NBA<00:02:45.889> NHL<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.549> got<00:02:46.879> most<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.299> those<00:02:47.450> games<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
NBA NHL I got most of those games so I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.530 
NBA NHL I got most of those games so I
was<00:02:48.980> thinking<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.459> making<00:02:49.579> a<00:02:49.849> series<00:02:50.269> called

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
was thinking of making a series called

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.199 
was thinking of making a series called
bring<00:02:51.139> back<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.680> old<00:02:51.709> games<00:02:52.280> or<00:02:52.609> something

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
bring back the old games or something

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.659 
bring back the old games or something
along<00:02:53.419> those<00:02:53.810> lines<00:02:53.930> where<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:55.219> kind<00:02:55.489> of

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
along those lines where I just kind of

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.959 
along those lines where I just kind of
two<00:02:56.060> parts<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.900> walk<00:02:57.590> through<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:58.699> it's

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
two parts and walk through so if it's

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.000 
two parts and walk through so if it's
you<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.719> probably<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.349> usually<00:03:00.799> going<00:03:00.919> to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you it's probably not usually going to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.159 
you it's probably not usually going to
be<00:03:01.129> online<00:03:01.310> because<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.689> know<00:03:02.840> those<00:03:03.019> old

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
be online because you know those old

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.259 
be online because you know those old
games<00:03:03.469> didn't<00:03:03.889> have<00:03:04.069> multiplayer<00:03:04.549> back<00:03:05.000> then

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
games didn't have multiplayer back then

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.530 
games didn't have multiplayer back then
but<00:03:05.540> maybe<00:03:06.169> it'll<00:03:06.379> be<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:06.680> co-op<00:03:07.189> or<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.849> don't

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
but maybe it'll be like co-op or I don't

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.869 
but maybe it'll be like co-op or I don't
know<00:03:08.750> just<00:03:08.989> campaigns<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.069> fooling<00:03:10.760> around

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
know just campaigns and fooling around

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.929 
know just campaigns and fooling around
on<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.449> old<00:03:11.599> games<00:03:11.980> for<00:03:12.980> me<00:03:13.099> it's<00:03:13.340> they're<00:03:13.699> so

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
on the old games for me it's they're so

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.809 
on the old games for me it's they're so
old<00:03:14.299> there<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.590> find<00:03:16.159> that's<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.639> to<00:03:16.699> be

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
old there so I find that's going to be

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.649 
old there so I find that's going to be
original<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:18.250> I'm<00:03:19.250> also<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.729> viewer<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.359> and

by some idiot and I got my dogs on my
chopper<00:06:34.770> like<00:06:35.490> I<00:06:35.640> said<00:06:35.700> not<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.419> greatest

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
chopper like I said not the greatest

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
alright but the gameplay wasn't the

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.650 
alright but the gameplay wasn't the
