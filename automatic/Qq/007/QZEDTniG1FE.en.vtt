00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
check it out we have some new markers

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.780 
check it out we have some new markers
here<00:00:01.560> from<00:00:01.770> Montana<00:00:02.159> these<00:00:02.520> are<00:00:02.669> their

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
here from Montana these are their

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.910 
here from Montana these are their
acrylic<00:00:03.270> water-based<00:00:03.510> markers<00:00:04.049> they're<00:00:04.740> nice

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
acrylic water-based markers they're nice

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.160 
acrylic water-based markers they're nice
and<00:00:05.160> non-toxic<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.270> they're<00:00:06.960> made<00:00:07.140> out

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
and non-toxic in that they're made out

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.230 
and non-toxic in that they're made out
of<00:00:07.319> all<00:00:07.500> water-based<00:00:07.980> products<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.760> they're

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of all water-based products so they're

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.120 
of all water-based products so they're
not<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.719> contains<00:00:10.440> Eileen<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.010> so

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
not going to be contains Eileen and so

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.089 
not going to be contains Eileen and so
forth<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.730> other<00:00:11.880> markers<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.450> but

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
forth like some other markers do but

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.010 
forth like some other markers do but
basically<00:00:14.099> they're<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:15.120> new<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.809> paint

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
basically they're the new kind of paint

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.900 
basically they're the new kind of paint
marker<00:00:16.320> style<00:00:16.560> these<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.949> smaller<00:00:17.220> nib

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
marker style these are the smaller nib

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
marker style these are the smaller nib
sizes<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.600> fine<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.170> extra<00:00:19.529> fine<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
sizes we have fine and extra fine so the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
sizes we have fine and extra fine so the
fine<00:00:20.699> tip<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.119> standard<00:00:21.600> 2<00:00:21.750> millimeter<00:00:22.140> nib

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
fine tip is a standard 2 millimeter nib

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.140 
fine tip is a standard 2 millimeter nib
you're<00:00:22.619> probably<00:00:22.890> familiar<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:23.789> as

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
you're probably familiar with them as

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.779 
you're probably familiar with them as
far<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> deco<00:00:25.080> size<00:00:25.320> goes<00:00:25.590> broad<00:00:26.250> tip<00:00:26.430> deco

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
far as the deco size goes broad tip deco

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.570 
far as the deco size goes broad tip deco
pretty<00:00:27.420> much<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> exact<00:00:27.930> same<00:00:27.960> nib<00:00:28.349> there<00:00:28.590> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
pretty much the exact same nib there so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
pretty much the exact same nib there so
that<00:00:30.300> being<00:00:30.449> said<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.439> get

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that being said you can pretty much get

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.889 
that being said you can pretty much get
use<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.700> canvas<00:00:33.300> work<00:00:33.630> or

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
use out of these for canvas work or

use out of these for canvas work or
black<00:00:34.290> book<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:34.800> you're<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> get

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
black book stuff you're not going to get

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
black book stuff you're not going to get
much<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.960> bigger<00:00:37.230> than<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:38.100> do

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
much out much bigger than that they do

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
much out much bigger than that they do
offer<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:38.910> larger<00:00:39.329> nib<00:00:39.930> sizes<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> body

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
offer a lot larger nib sizes and body

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
offer a lot larger nib sizes and body
markers<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:42.090> those<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> different

but<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> markers<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> extra<00:00:52.800> fine<00:00:53.010> comes

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
but for the markers the extra fine comes

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
but for the markers the extra fine comes
in<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> point<00:00:53.820> 7<00:00:54.239> millimeter<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.260> super

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in a point 7 millimeter this is super

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
in a point 7 millimeter this is super
small<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.210> limited

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
small and don't think that are limited

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.650 
small and don't think that are limited
to<00:00:57.870> these<00:00:58.859> size<00:00:59.160> nibs<00:00:59.550> there's<00:01:00.030> also<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.390> range

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to these size nibs there's also a range

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
to these size nibs there's also a range
at<00:01:01.469> least<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.550> two<00:01:02.820> markers<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> can

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
at least for these two markers you can

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.289 
at least for these two markers you can
get<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:04.290> bullet<00:01:04.949> tip<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.760> also<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
get a bullet tip you can also get a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.929 
get a bullet tip you can also get a
calligraphy<00:01:06.900> tip<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:08.100> varied<00:01:08.400> sizes<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
calligraphy tip in some varied sizes so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
calligraphy tip in some varied sizes so
you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> calligraphy<00:01:09.840> tip<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> 2

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you can get a calligraphy tip up to a 2

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
you can get a calligraphy tip up to a 2
millimeter<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> extra<00:01:11.760> fine<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.570> bullet

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
millimeter for the extra fine the bullet

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
millimeter for the extra fine the bullet
tip<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:14.040> millimeter<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.880> bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
tip is one millimeter so a little bit

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
tip is one millimeter so a little bit
bigger<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> stock<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.990> well<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> point

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
bigger than the stock as well as a point

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
bigger than the stock as well as a point
5<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.909> needle<00:01:18.270> tip<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.689> really

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
5 kind of like needle tip so really

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890 
5 kind of like needle tip so really
really<00:01:19.290> small<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.659> stock<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
really small on that but the stock is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
really small on that but the stock is
0.7<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.159> 2<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> also

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
0.7 and then 2 for this but you can also

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
0.7 and then 2 for this but you can also
get<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> chisel<00:01:25.770> tip<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.280> calligraphy<00:01:26.790> tip

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
get a chisel tip and a calligraphy tip

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
get a chisel tip and a calligraphy tip
two<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.930> options<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.740> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
two different little options that are in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
two different little options that are in
addition<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.390> markers<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.840> pretty

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
addition but these markers are pretty

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.870 
addition but these markers are pretty
easy<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.979> far<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.900> replacing<00:01:33.900> nibs<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
easy as far as replacing nibs and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
easy as far as replacing nibs and
refilling<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.540> basic<00:01:36.930> twist<00:01:37.229> off

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
refilling them it's basic twist off

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
refilling them it's basic twist off
clear<00:01:37.920> body<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> ever<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:39.000> new<00:01:39.299> color

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
clear body so if you ever put new color

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
clear body so if you ever put new color
in<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.590> exactly<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.130> you're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
in there you know exactly what you're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
in there you know exactly what you're
pumping<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> nice<00:01:42.540> feature<00:01:42.750> from

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
pumping out which is a nice feature from

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:56.880 
pumping out which is a nice feature from
that<00:01:43.259> stuff<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> cyan

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.080 

now<00:01:57.890> we'll<00:01:58.040> just<00:01:58.160> do<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> line<00:01:58.550> test<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.940> show

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
now we'll just do a line test to show

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.890 
now we'll just do a line test to show
you<00:01:59.150> how<00:01:59.360> smooth<00:01:59.690> they<00:01:59.840> write<00:02:01.540> next<00:02:02.540> up<00:02:02.750> we

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
you how smooth they write next up we

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:20.190 
you how smooth they write next up we
have<00:02:02.930> shock<00:02:03.500> light

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.980 

and<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:22.100> another<00:02:22.340> line<00:02:22.610> test<00:02:22.940> after<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.720> nice

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
and then another line test after a nice

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.990 
and then another line test after a nice
fill<00:02:24.290> asks<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> fine<00:02:25.010> tips<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.490> have<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
fill asks for the fine tips we have a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:45.900 
fill asks for the fine tips we have a
fluorescent<00:02:26.330> acid<00:02:27.020> green

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.890 

all<00:02:46.910> right<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.090> we're<00:02:47.209> gonna<00:02:47.269> have<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.480> zoom<00:02:47.750> in

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
all right so we're gonna have to zoom in

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.180 
all right so we're gonna have to zoom in
a<00:02:47.930> little<00:02:48.080> bit<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.709> get<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:48.980> extra

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
a little bit here to get these extra

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.280 
a little bit here to get these extra
fine<00:02:49.519> markers<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.300> here<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.629> have<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.989> shocked

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
fine markers so here we have the shocked

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:06.820 
fine markers so here we have the shocked
black

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.160 

next<00:03:07.830> up<00:03:07.920> we've<00:03:08.040> got<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.310> shocked<00:03:08.640> lilac<00:03:09.330> deep

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
next up we've got the shocked lilac deep

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:28.260 
next up we've got the shocked lilac deep
purple<00:03:10.590> color

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:47.260 

shock<00:03:29.270> light<00:03:29.660> blue

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.760 

after<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.360> shock<00:03:48.630> white<00:03:48.900> will<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.290> using<00:03:49.710> a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
after the shock white will be using a

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:00.130 
after the shock white will be using a
dark<00:03:49.980> surface

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.559 

it<00:04:00.710> feeds<00:04:00.920> away<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.520> bit<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.150> final

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
it feeds away a little bit on the final

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.449 
it feeds away a little bit on the final
as<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:02.990> a<00:04:03.020> slick<00:04:03.380> surface<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.980> not<00:04:04.130> really

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
as it is a slick surface and not really

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.100 
as it is a slick surface and not really
porous<00:04:04.819> much<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.360> paper<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.690> was<00:04:05.870> using

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
porous much like the paper I was using

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.170 
porous much like the paper I was using
but<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.340> end<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:07.610> can<00:04:07.730> still<00:04:07.940> see<00:04:08.060> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
but in the end you can still see the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.270 
but in the end you can still see the
opacity<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.720> really<00:04:08.990> great<00:04:09.200> for<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.740> chalk

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
opacity is really great for the chalk

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.490 
opacity is really great for the chalk
white<00:04:10.490> so<00:04:11.060> after<00:04:11.390> using<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.840> Montana<00:04:12.140> markers

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
white so after using the Montana markers

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.870 
white so after using the Montana markers
for<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.709> little<00:04:12.920> while<00:04:13.100> now<00:04:13.310> I've<00:04:13.459> got<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.670> good

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
for a little while now I've got a good

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.610 
for a little while now I've got a good
feeling<00:04:14.120> for<00:04:14.480> how<00:04:14.600> they<00:04:14.750> really<00:04:14.930> work<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.440> I'm

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
feeling for how they really work and I'm

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.770 
feeling for how they really work and I'm
really<00:04:15.890> happy<00:04:16.160> with<00:04:16.280> what<00:04:16.669> they're<00:04:16.790> doing<00:04:16.820> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
really happy with what they're doing the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.479 
really happy with what they're doing the
opacity<00:04:18.079> was<00:04:18.410> definitely<00:04:18.799> there<00:04:18.950> for<00:04:19.190> all<00:04:19.310> the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
opacity was definitely there for all the

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.340 
opacity was definitely there for all the
different<00:04:19.760> colors<00:04:20.060> even<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.750> white<00:04:20.930> on<00:04:21.140> the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
different colors even the white on the

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.500 
different colors even the white on the
glossy<00:04:21.950> black<00:04:22.040> surface<00:04:22.610> held<00:04:22.880> up<00:04:23.030> nice<00:04:23.270> and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
glossy black surface held up nice and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.390 
glossy black surface held up nice and
well<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:24.140> light<00:04:24.350> blue<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.890> white<00:04:25.070> was

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
well the light blue on the white was

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.520 
well the light blue on the white was
nice<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.940> even<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.630> fluorescent<00:04:27.169> color<00:04:27.350> was

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
nice and even the fluorescent color was

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.800 
nice and even the fluorescent color was
a<00:04:27.560> big<00:04:27.950> improvement<00:04:28.160> from<00:04:28.880> everything<00:04:29.690> I've

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
a big improvement from everything I've

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.900 
a big improvement from everything I've
really<00:04:30.020> used<00:04:30.230> in<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.410> past<00:04:30.910> fluorescent

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
really used in the past fluorescent

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.860 
really used in the past fluorescent
colors<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.240> wanted<00:04:32.480> to<00:04:32.540> highlight

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
colors I wanted to highlight

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020 
colors I wanted to highlight
I<00:04:33.080> guess<00:04:33.440> specifically<00:04:34.040> I've<00:04:34.550> really<00:04:34.880> had<00:04:34.970> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
I guess specifically I've really had a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.610 
I guess specifically I've really had a
tough<00:04:35.240> time<00:04:35.270> with<00:04:35.480> those<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.020> past<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.410> love

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
tough time with those in the past I love

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.260 
tough time with those in the past I love
using<00:04:36.890> them<00:04:37.100> but<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.490> always<00:04:37.910> seem<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.150> be

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
using them but they always seem to be

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.080 
using them but they always seem to be
really<00:04:38.630> hard<00:04:38.840> with<00:04:39.080> opacity<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.970> know

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
really hard with opacity and you know

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.940 
really hard with opacity and you know
flow<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.600> everything<00:04:41.930> just<00:04:42.080> because<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:42.890> a

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
flow and everything just because it's a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.250 
flow and everything just because it's a
lot<00:04:43.130> thinner<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.669> color<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.750> being<00:04:44.990> said

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
lot thinner of a color that being said

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.840 
lot thinner of a color that being said
it's<00:04:45.470> still<00:04:45.740> not<00:04:45.860> perfect<00:04:46.310> they're<00:04:46.460> still<00:04:46.669> not

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's still not perfect they're still not

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.720 
it's still not perfect they're still not
all<00:04:47.150> right<00:04:47.390> going<00:04:47.990> over<00:04:48.290> blacks<00:04:48.560> per<00:04:48.919> se<00:04:49.160> but

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
all right going over blacks per se but

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.940 
all right going over blacks per se but
definitely<00:04:50.510> therefore<00:04:50.960> opacity<00:04:51.500> as<00:04:51.680> far<00:04:51.860> as

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
definitely therefore opacity as far as

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.380 
definitely therefore opacity as far as
fluorescents<00:04:52.520> definitely<00:04:52.910> my<00:04:53.000> favorite

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
fluorescents definitely my favorite

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.900 
fluorescents definitely my favorite
fluorescent<00:04:53.870> color<00:04:54.020> I've<00:04:54.530> used<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:55.520> date<00:04:55.700> I

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
fluorescent color I've used to date I

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.090 
fluorescent color I've used to date I
should<00:04:56.150> say<00:04:56.530> opacity<00:04:57.530> was<00:04:57.650> there<00:04:57.800> for<00:04:58.010> the

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
should say opacity was there for the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.490 
should say opacity was there for the
light<00:04:58.250> blue<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.669> pink<00:04:58.850> totally<00:04:59.360> right<00:05:00.290> on

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
light blue and the pink totally right on

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.860 
light blue and the pink totally right on
with<00:05:01.130> everything<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.180> works<00:05:02.570> great

with everything and works great

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.890 
with everything and works great
definitely<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> good<00:05:04.430> step<00:05:04.760> above<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.690> rest

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
definitely a good step above the rest

definitely a good step above the rest
with<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.320> refill<00:05:06.680> purposes<00:05:07.250> of<00:05:07.520> being<00:05:08.090> able

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.240 
with the refill purposes of being able
to<00:05:08.300> just<00:05:08.390> unscrew<00:05:08.990> it<00:05:09.020> clear<00:05:09.710> body<00:05:09.950> so<00:05:10.190> you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
to just unscrew it clear body so you

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.800 
to just unscrew it clear body so you
know<00:05:10.400> what<00:05:10.550> colors<00:05:10.850> being<00:05:11.419> produced

I<00:05:28.130> know<00:05:28.460> they've<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.180> created<00:05:29.690> headache

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
I know they've just created headache

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.530 
I know they've just created headache
after<00:05:30.380> headache<00:05:30.680> because<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.640> nibs<00:05:31.880> are<00:05:32.210> so

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
after headache because the nibs are so

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.450 
after headache because the nibs are so
small<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:32.870> there<00:05:33.229> only<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:34.040> a<00:05:34.070> little<00:05:34.280> bit<00:05:34.370> of

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
paint in there and that allows them to

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.100 
paint in there and that allows them to
dry<00:05:36.200> up<00:05:36.380> super<00:05:36.740> quickly<00:05:36.979> so<00:05:37.669> this<00:05:38.330> new<00:05:38.750> style

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
plastic tip so we're going to just call

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.300 
plastic tip so we're going to just call
it<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.419> new<00:05:53.539> tip<00:05:53.750> from<00:05:54.020> Montana<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.800> it's

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
it the new tip from Montana and it's

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.310 
it the new tip from Montana and it's
working<00:05:55.760> great<00:05:55.910> it's<00:05:56.240> I've<00:05:56.600> been<00:05:57.020> at<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.169> for

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
working great it's I've been at it for

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.350 
working great it's I've been at it for
probably<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.010> couple<00:05:58.130> weeks<00:05:58.430> now<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.669> it

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
probably a couple weeks now and it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.060 
probably a couple weeks now and it
hasn't<00:05:59.510> dried<00:05:59.810> up<00:06:00.020> just<00:06:00.530> once<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.830> get<00:06:00.950> it

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
hasn't dried up just once you get it

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.590 
hasn't dried up just once you get it
flowing<00:06:01.250> works<00:06:01.760> well<00:06:01.970> for<00:06:02.180> an<00:06:02.240> outline<00:06:02.570> and

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
flowing works well for an outline and

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.810 
flowing works well for an outline and
then<00:06:02.930> cap<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.530> off<00:06:03.770> and<00:06:04.039> it's<00:06:04.250> good<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.490> go<00:06:04.610> for

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
then cap it off and it's good to go for

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.920 
then cap it off and it's good to go for
the<00:06:04.880> next<00:06:05.060> time

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
the next time

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.659 
the next time
much<00:06:06.440> like<00:06:06.620> any<00:06:06.740> paint<00:06:07.010> marker<00:06:07.340> you<00:06:07.490> got<00:06:07.640> a

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
much like any paint marker you got a

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.110 
much like any paint marker you got a
juicy

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
juicy

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.530 
juicy
every<00:06:08.600> once<00:06:08.750> in<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.900> while<00:06:09.610> they<00:06:10.610> do<00:06:10.669> flow<00:06:11.330> nice

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540
