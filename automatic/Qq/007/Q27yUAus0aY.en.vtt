yeah yeah okay so here's every this is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.519 
yeah yeah okay so here's every this is
going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:21.990> cut<00:00:22.170> down<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.740> fit<00:00:23.189> into<00:00:23.460> this

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
going to be cut down to fit into this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.230 
going to be cut down to fit into this
which<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.789> led<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> piezo

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
which is going to be led to the piezo

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.040 
which is going to be led to the piezo
disc<00:00:30.570> from<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:32.279> audio<00:00:32.579> wire<00:00:33.469> like<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:36.050> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
disc from with audio wire like so this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
disc from with audio wire like so this
is<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:39.890> here<00:00:41.690> I'm<00:00:42.690> actually

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is going to be put in here I'm actually

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.389 
is going to be put in here I'm actually
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:45.860> put<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.980> jack<00:00:49.010> probably<00:00:50.010> there

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
going to put this jack probably there

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
going to put this jack probably there
and<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> piece<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> disc<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.809> under

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and have the piece of disc just under

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.389 
and have the piece of disc just under
this<00:00:55.379> laying<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:57.379> yeah<00:01:00.199> yeah<00:01:01.199> okay<00:01:01.590> here's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.000 
this laying there yeah yeah okay here's
the<00:01:03.470> circuit<00:01:05.390> here's<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> basic<00:01:06.960> preamp<00:01:07.619> for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the circuit here's the basic preamp for

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.469 
the circuit here's the basic preamp for
the<00:01:09.979> guitar<00:01:11.090> acoustic<00:01:12.090> guitar<00:01:15.259> alright<00:01:17.479> still

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the guitar acoustic guitar alright still

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
need the audio jack to go in that'll go

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.710 
need the audio jack to go in that'll go
in<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:23.369> need<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.680> piezo<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.860> disc<00:01:26.720> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
in and I need be a piezo a disc and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
in and I need be a piezo a disc and
actually<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> pickup<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
actually be the pickup which will go in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually be the pickup which will go in
there<00:01:29.729> too<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.400> fit<00:01:35.670> in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
there too and and it all fit in

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.230 
there too and and it all fit in
this<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> battery<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.939> slip

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
this with the battery and this will slip

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.160 
this with the battery and this will slip
into<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> guitar<00:01:41.390> yeah<00:01:45.049> okay

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.360 

circuit<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.790> done<00:01:52.730> yeah<00:01:53.730> so<00:01:54.030> here's<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> disk

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
circuit is done yeah so here's the disk

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.620 
circuit is done yeah so here's the disk
this<00:01:56.370> is<00:01:56.430> everything

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
in I cut a little battery holders I'm

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.510 
in I cut a little battery holders I'm
going<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.970> put<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.270> guitar<00:03:11.569> like<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.780> said

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
going to put in the guitar like I said

going to put in the guitar like I said
but<00:03:13.520> I'm<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:13.790> testing<00:03:13.940> on<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.390> here's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
but I'm just testing on this here's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.330 
but I'm just testing on this here's
actual<00:03:15.110> circuit<00:03:15.500> covered<00:03:15.800> up<00:03:15.890> by<00:03:15.980> Samara

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
actual circuit covered up by Samara

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.850 
actual circuit covered up by Samara
padding<00:03:17.260> plugged<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.300> speaker<00:03:20.860> it's

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
padding plugged in to the speaker it's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:41.070 
padding plugged in to the speaker it's
taped<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.550> this<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.300> test<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.690> out<00:03:40.030> it

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
taped on to this just to test it out it

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:55.220 
taped on to this just to test it out it
works

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:05:56.850 

 yeah<00:03:58.220> yeah<00:03:59.220> okay<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.790> did
