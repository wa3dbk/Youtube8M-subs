00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.550 
difficult part at least for starters
you're<00:02:28.489> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.760> want<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.000> take<00:02:29.239> up<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:30.380> want

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you're going to want to take up you want

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.470 
you're going to want to take up you want
to<00:02:30.650> land<00:02:30.950> your<00:02:31.220> right<00:02:31.519> knee<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.970> your<00:02:32.269> left

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
to land your right knee on your left

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.960 
to land your right knee on your left
your<00:02:33.380> left<00:02:33.410> elbow<00:02:33.799> okay<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.730> you're<00:02:34.820> going<00:02:34.910> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
your left elbow okay so you're going to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.830 
your left elbow okay so you're going to
jump<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:37.070> land<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.790> didn't<00:02:38.390> land<00:02:38.540> there

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
jump and then land I didn't land there

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.690 
jump and then land I didn't land there
but<00:02:39.079> that's<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.829> you'll<00:02:40.130> look<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:40.370> when

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
but that's what you'll look like when

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.430 
but that's what you'll look like when
you<00:02:40.790> first<00:02:40.970> start<00:02:41.239> when<00:02:41.600> when<00:02:42.049> you're<00:02:42.260> first

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you first start when when you're first

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.039 
you first start when when you're first
starting<00:02:42.590> you're<00:02:42.920> going<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.100> do<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:44.049> but

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
starting you're going to do this but

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.680 
starting you're going to do this but
don't<00:02:45.230> worry<00:02:45.410> you're<00:02:45.680> getting<00:02:46.010> somewhere<00:02:46.690> if

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
don't worry you're getting somewhere if

I'm<00:04:11.069> sorry<00:04:11.340> go<00:04:11.519> fall<00:04:11.989> but<00:04:12.989> if<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.189> keep<00:04:14.370> trying

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
I'm sorry go fall but if you keep trying

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.819 
I'm sorry go fall but if you keep trying
then<00:04:15.150> keep<00:04:15.450> falling<00:04:15.959> you're<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.650> see

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
then keep falling you're going to see

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.689 
then keep falling you're going to see
that<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.669> fall<00:04:17.940> less<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:19.199> fall<00:04:19.650> after<00:04:20.430> a

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
that you fall less or you fall after a

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.689 
that you fall less or you fall after a
longer<00:04:21.150> period<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.510> time<00:04:21.570> because<00:04:22.699> you're

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
longer period of time because you're

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.270 
longer period of time because you're
bouncing<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.570> because<00:04:25.440> it's<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.979> different

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
bouncing more because it's a different
