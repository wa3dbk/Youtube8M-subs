that stuff I was kind of nervous I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
that stuff I was kind of nervous I
didn't<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.870> our<00:00:54.989> team<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.500> lose<00:00:55.739> focus

didn't want our team to get lose focus

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
didn't want our team to get lose focus
because<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.579> team<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.059> uh<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
because our team was uh it was a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
because our team was uh it was a
tight-knit<00:00:58.320> group<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.489> fact<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.879> we

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
tight-knit group and the fact that we

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.520 
tight-knit group and the fact that we
played<00:01:00.809> together<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.690> everybody<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
played together and everybody you know

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
played together and everybody you know
played<00:01:05.309> hard<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:07.619> us

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
played hard I think that's what got us

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.750 
played hard I think that's what got us
over<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.670> these

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
over the top and a lot of these

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
over the top and a lot of these
different<00:01:08.939> situations<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.229> didn't<00:01:10.770> want

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
different situations and I didn't want

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
different situations and I didn't want
that<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.310> affected<00:01:11.760> by<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> media<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that to be affected by the media and I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
that to be affected by the media and I
think<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> our<00:01:13.140> team<00:01:13.350> handled<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> great<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
think that our team handled it great I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.249 
think that our team handled it great I
think<00:01:14.340> our<00:01:14.460> coach<00:01:14.689> kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> led<00:01:15.930> us<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
think our coach kind of led us in the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.510 
think our coach kind of led us in the
right<00:01:16.380> direction<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.979> put<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.369> into

first time for us playing this in the
playoffs<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> thought<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.899> pretty

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
playoffs I thought that was pretty

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.039 
playoffs I thought that was pretty
special<00:01:52.259> too<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
special too and for them to have the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.810 
special too and for them to have the
home-field<00:01:56.040> advantage<00:01:56.549> throughout<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
home-field advantage throughout the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.600> how<00:01:58.079> arrogant<00:01:58.469> they<00:01:58.710> were

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
playoffs and how arrogant they were

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.679 
playoffs and how arrogant they were
about<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.540> I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
about you know where they are you I

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.850 
about you know where they are you I
think<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:00.990> were<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.200> arrogant<00:02:01.560> about

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
think they were pretty arrogant about

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.350 
think they were pretty arrogant about
you<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.189> patrick<00:02:02.729> crayton<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.149> pretty

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you know patrick crayton was pretty

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080 
you know patrick crayton was pretty
arrogant<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.490> given<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
arrogant I think they had given out that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
arrogant I think they had given out that
NFC<00:02:06.509> eight<00:02:06.719> championship<00:02:07.290> tickets<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.979> their
