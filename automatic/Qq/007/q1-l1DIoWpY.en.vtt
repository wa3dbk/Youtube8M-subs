because of the fake Santa and his power
is<00:05:55.010> at<00:05:55.250> its<00:05:55.370> lowest

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.470 

there<00:06:00.260> is<00:06:00.380> no<00:06:00.620> turning<00:06:01.070> back<00:06:01.100> as<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.580> Dell<00:06:02.240> would

with<00:06:06.020> all<00:06:06.320> our<00:06:06.650> strength<00:06:07.090> my<00:06:08.090> only<00:06:08.330> concern<00:06:08.870> is

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900

that<00:06:09.230> whatever<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:09.860> have<00:06:10.250> inside<00:06:10.670> me<00:06:10.730> may<00:06:11.480> try

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
that whatever I have inside me may try

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.620 
that whatever I have inside me may try
to<00:06:11.840> take<00:06:12.110> control<00:06:12.320> again<00:06:13.010> my<00:06:13.760> greatest<00:06:14.180> source

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
to take control again my greatest source

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.510 
to take control again my greatest source
of<00:06:14.840> power

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
of power

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.870 
of power
it<00:06:16.580> worse<00:06:16.849> to<00:06:17.090> use<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.509> and<00:06:17.660> win
