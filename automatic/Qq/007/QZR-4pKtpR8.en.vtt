00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
really nice there's there's pretty much

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.850 
really nice there's there's pretty much
no<00:01:21.390> way<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.020> accidentally<00:01:22.700> slip<00:01:23.700> out

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
no way this can accidentally slip out

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
no way this can accidentally slip out
because<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.130> can't<00:01:26.340> even<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.470> can't<00:01:28.470> even

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
because it can't even go in I can't even

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.700 
because it can't even go in I can't even
go<00:01:28.950> outward<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.400> by<00:01:29.579> pulling<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> pushing

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
go outward just by pulling and pushing

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.170 
go outward just by pulling and pushing
because<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> fitting<00:01:33.659> inside<00:01:35.030> actually<00:01:36.030> has

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
because the fitting inside actually has

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
because the fitting inside actually has
a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.479> indent<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.770> over<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> screw

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a little indent you see over the screw

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.480 
a little indent you see over the screw
goes<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:40.950> black<00:01:41.220> dot

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
goes and on here that little black dot

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
goes and on here that little black dot
is<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.150> goes<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.659> place<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> while<00:01:45.630> that's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is what goes in place so while that's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.859 
is what goes in place so while that's
being<00:01:46.200> held<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.649> there<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> horse<00:01:48.720> shoe

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
being held in there the horse shoe

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
being held in there the horse shoe
fitting<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> pretty<00:01:50.009> tight<00:01:50.310> bond

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
fitting actually has a pretty tight bond

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
fitting actually has a pretty tight bond
against<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> still<00:01:52.140> turns<00:01:52.439> pretty

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
against it but it still turns pretty

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
against it but it still turns pretty
good<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.380> stays<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.649> there

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
good so and it just stays on there

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230 
good so and it just stays on there
really<00:01:56.040> nice<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
really nice and as you can see this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
really nice and as you can see this
little<00:01:57.540> fuzzy<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:58.079> right<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
little fuzzy thing right here that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.639 
little fuzzy thing right here that
didn't<00:01:59.579> come<00:01:59.820> with<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.570> strap<00:02:01.079> locks<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
