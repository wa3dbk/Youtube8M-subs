00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
they can't really show it great but

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.800 
they can't really show it great but
anyway<00:05:16.280> these<00:05:16.580> little<00:05:16.910> groups<00:05:17.120> here<00:05:17.420> count

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
anyway these little groups here count

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.680 
anyway these little groups here count
them<00:05:18.080> make<00:05:19.010> sure<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.970> even<00:05:20.300> on<00:05:20.420> both

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
them make sure you have it even on both

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.400 
them make sure you have it even on both
sides<00:05:21.460> when<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.580> go<00:05:22.760> ahead<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.210> turn<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.260> off

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
sides when you go ahead and turn it off

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.160 
sides when you go ahead and turn it off
these<00:05:24.680> are<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.950> groups<00:05:25.220> here<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:26.750> basically

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
these are the groups here so basically

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.990 
these are the groups here so basically
the<00:05:27.380> stretch<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.710> chain<00:05:28.190> all<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:28.520> gonna<00:05:28.700> do<00:05:28.970> is

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
the stretch a chain all you gonna do is

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.410 
the stretch a chain all you gonna do is
loosen<00:05:29.480> it<00:05:29.900> up<00:05:30.020> for<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:30.920> to<00:05:31.040> push<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:32.090> back

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
loosen it up for it to push this back

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.840 
loosen it up for it to push this back
out<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:33.800> don't<00:05:33.920> want<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.220> do<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.460> too<00:05:34.640> much

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
out you don't want to do it too much

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.150 
out you don't want to do it too much
because<00:05:35.720> once<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.260> tighten<00:05:36.680> up<00:05:36.740> back<00:05:36.980> the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
because once you tighten up back the

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.120 
because once you tighten up back the
wheel<00:05:37.340> it's<00:05:37.970> gonna<00:05:38.210> get<00:05:38.390> real<00:05:38.810> tight<00:05:39.230> so<00:05:40.040> you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
wheel it's gonna get real tight so you

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.910 
wheel it's gonna get real tight so you
just<00:05:40.370> got<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.670> do<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.300> real<00:05:41.600> just<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.470> little<00:05:42.800> bit

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
just got to do it real just a little bit

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.850 
just got to do it real just a little bit
and<00:05:43.220> just<00:05:43.420> count<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.570> turns<00:05:44.870> as<00:05:45.410> well<00:05:45.530> as

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
and just count the turns as well as

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.110 
and just count the turns as well as
match<00:05:46.070> it<00:05:46.280> up<00:05:46.340> right<00:05:46.550> here

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
match it up right here

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.060 
match it up right here
shouldn't<00:05:47.780> be<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:48.110> much<00:05:48.290> at<00:05:48.500> all<00:05:48.590> should<00:05:48.890> we

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
shouldn't be that much at all should we

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.210 
shouldn't be that much at all should we
just<00:05:49.310> maybe<00:05:49.580> one<00:05:50.060> or<00:05:50.300> two<00:05:50.830> half<00:05:51.830> turns<00:05:54.220> all

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
just maybe one or two half turns all

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.400 
just maybe one or two half turns all
right<00:05:57.760> all<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:58.940> screws<00:05:59.240> are<00:05:59.450> tightened<00:05:59.720> up

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.300 

let's<00:06:03.410> play<00:06:05.290> autoplay<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:06.320> all<00:06:07.010> of<00:06:07.160> that

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
let's play autoplay and all of that

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.080 
let's play autoplay and all of that
inspecting<00:06:08.120> is<00:06:08.270> just<00:06:08.540> it<00:06:11.560> same<00:06:12.560> tighten<00:06:13.250> start

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
inspecting is just it same tighten start

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.330 
inspecting is just it same tighten start
it<00:06:14.210> up<00:06:14.330> let<00:06:14.570> it<00:06:14.660> run<00:06:14.870> for<00:06:15.140> a<00:06:15.200> little<00:06:15.500> bit<00:06:15.650> and

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:47.680
