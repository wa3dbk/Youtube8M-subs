and<00:01:20.690> go<00:01:21.409> here<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.710> tutorial<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and go here for the tutorial just to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.039 
and go here for the tutorial just to
show<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.259> guys<00:01:24.470> um<00:01:25.330> yeah<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.360> chose<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.720> Mario

show you guys um yeah I chose the Mario
modest<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.560> probably<00:01:27.740> see<00:01:28.039> it's<00:01:28.280> just

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
modest you can probably see it's just

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.660 
modest you can probably see it's just
boost<00:01:28.819> through<00:01:29.000> here<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:31.280> will<00:01:31.399> probably

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
boost through here and I will probably

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.550 
boost through here and I will probably
be<00:01:31.970> getting<00:01:32.149> an<00:01:32.209> S<00:01:32.390> because<00:01:32.690> it's<00:01:33.080> pretty<00:01:33.380> hard

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
be getting an S because it's pretty hard

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.800 
be getting an S because it's pretty hard
to<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.770> an<00:01:33.830> S<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:34.220> game<00:01:34.539> I'm<00:01:35.539> especially

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
to get an S in this game I'm especially

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.779 
to get an S in this game I'm especially
later<00:01:36.170> on<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> game<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.979> way<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.489> get<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.759> a

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
later on in the game a way to get to a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.040 
later on in the game a way to get to a
chamar<00:01:38.590> Alaska<00:01:39.610> it's<00:01:40.610> pretty<00:01:40.759> hard<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.060> get

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
chamar Alaska it's pretty hard to get

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.889 
chamar Alaska it's pretty hard to get
it's<00:01:42.229> pretty<00:01:42.470> icy<00:01:42.590> isis<00:01:43.039> but<00:01:43.300> it's<00:01:44.300> it's<00:01:44.629> it's

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's pretty icy isis but it's it's it's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.279 
it's pretty icy isis but it's it's it's
still<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:45.410> still<00:01:45.470> really<00:01:45.830> good<00:01:45.979> hack<00:01:46.429> I<00:01:47.289> love

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
still it's still really good hack I love

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.440 
still it's still really good hack I love
this<00:01:48.410> is<00:01:48.560> probably<00:01:48.739> my<00:01:48.950> favorite<00:01:48.979> hack<00:01:49.610> out<00:01:50.330> of
