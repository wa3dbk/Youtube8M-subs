00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hi all 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.279
 today we have the lamp cube again 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.770
 because you had not already shown it in the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.869
 video of the Christmas cubes yes 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.369
 but I'm going to dedicate a video because 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.869
 because it 's an awesome cube and I 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.570
 love so clear to see what happens and 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.279
 where is it here you see what beauty or 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.240
 be the lamp cube that shines in the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.939
 darkness can be solved 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.089
 perfectly amazing, not the first 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.859
 that caught my attention because it was the 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.449
 size is not a huge cube let's 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.999
 buy it here with a rubik's cube 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.250
 standard beige or you know it's awful 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.830
 not super great other thing that I like 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.290
 much is that clear when having a light 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.860
 inside the body is transparent no 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.530
 because otherwise you would not see anything you see 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.590
 we can see the fish cube 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.360
 through through the cube we are not going to 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 approach us please miguel you are very 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.070
 far 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.470
 You see that it looks perfectly not here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 reflects a bit but nothing is seen without 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.739
 problem and since we are this close 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 let's see the stickers is also 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.149
 because of course they are not so big they are 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.559
 not huge but it's very good no I have not 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.119
 had no problem is very well 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.090
 posts I'm very happy with this 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.960
 rubik's brand product and one thing 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 surprising 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 go away for god and turn well or be one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 I could think that a potato like that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 great then I would go super 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.440
 orthopedic not and if it takes very hard 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.690
 but it will not go well for us in fact it's 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.520
 even surprising that I turn not 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.280
 because already this product simply as 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 typical decoration lamp the typical 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.970
 decoration object would be fine but 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.400
 it does not turn and you also see 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 look good or have a nice turn 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450
 You see that you can solve it without problem 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 nothing in a minute or a couple of minutes to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.440
 see if you take a little time to solve them 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 the size not because of course when you do 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 This type of money turns out to cost you a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.260
 little not where is the red face that I 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 I really like it here because it is not 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.430
 because we are not going to make a permutation 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.840
 dude ta what crazy to see if good to see if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.179
 we are able to see 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.759
 sometimes you already know this is not super 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.520
 curious when one is used to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.869
 do these algorithms to a certain 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.579
 speed as I have already commented in other 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.410
 occasions and if you do them very slowly 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.539
 because you lose not because because the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.140
 brain memorizes well at this speed and 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.450
 is already 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.300
 sometimes this is the typical cube 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.870
 with whom crying with emotion is worth so 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.450
 of course now it just happens to me good 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.280
 whatever we are going to see you have not said 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.810
 that this cube is a lamp because it does not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.810
 light is the light and you close the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.069
 shutters tell me good calm down what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.440
 we see in 321 to see that I can not tell what 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.540
 we see now it seems normal to you this you see 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.069
 what impressive awesome beauty 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.200
 I am deeply in love with this 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.470
 cube in addition the stickers are distinguished 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.230
 perfectly not because I could be 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.150
 not to be the case and I know the red and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.739
 the orange could look the same but not 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.769
 you see that they perfectly distinguish 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.510
 green and blue is blue cease green 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.890
 is this are also distinguished very well or 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.400
 be that there will not be any problem 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.450
 We will not find the pieces 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.799
 easily to see me I have always been 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.690
 I really liked the cubes that shine in 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.510
 the darkness and now I'm going to count a couple 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.040
 of experiences but let's turn a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.840
 little for example 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.269
 in past Christmas I have been 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.560
 gifted rubies touch but what happens 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.780
 with that cube worth shines in the dark 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.819
 that is, it has little lights, but it does not 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.769
 tour you know it's like a rubik's cube 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.409
 but with lights then I that I know for 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.569
 turn a face you do well and it goes 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.879
 they move the lights or they illuminate the 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.010
 pieces but there are no physical turns worth and 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.989
 in this together and I like a lot do not 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.030
 because to see one of the things 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.150
 interesting of the cubes is power 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.950
 have it in their hands turn the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.719
 not those things that do not relax enough 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 they shine as well as the 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.480
 ruby are you were defective had 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.480
 many defective units 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.770
 super expensive expensive or a price 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.239
 exorbitant for what is and will also be 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.709
 a mess because I wanted to turn 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.880
 this face but there was only one face 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.470
 sensitive in the first one you have to 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.030
 make this turn then turn then go back 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.000
 to leave them you already lost completely 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.620
 a disaster rubies touch I do not like 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.940
 then I bought some stickers 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.560
 by the way you see that it looks like a kind 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.510
 I think it will be a good nightclub 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.980
 idea is to decorate nightclubs with this not 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.230
 sure that just as people would become 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.970
 crazy not sure we're going to approach a 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.860
 little more go buy some stickers 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.900
 that shone in the dark but not 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.690
 the typical and disgusting green stickers 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.639
 you know not this typical brightness did not put in 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.130
 the website if they distinguish the colors 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.350
 that is, you put red and in theory in the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.330
 darkness 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.979
 they absorbed light during the day I do not know 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.750
 what and then they looked red and blue 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.000
 blue to me to see and it seemed a little 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.610
 weird because I do not know that man never 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.490
 I had seen and I bought them was for a 5 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.710
 for 5 I think I put them to the 555 show 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.900
 then turn off the light and what happens because there 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.000
 it looked nothing obviously all black black 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.880
 black black you did not see anything and what happens 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.889
 I sent an email to the man and I told him 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.430
 Mr. sir, I do not see 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.139
 It's all dark and he told me to see and see 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.240
 if we read well to see if we read well 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.879
 because on the website I said that the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.680
 colors stand alone and they 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.659
 they illuminate with ultraviolet light ie 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.210
 you had to buy a light bulb 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:13.550
 ultraviolet illuminate the cube and then 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:15.889
 yes you saw the colors of the cube not what 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.449
 I distinguished it is blue green with light 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.370
 ultraviolet but of course I will not buy 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.749
 a lamp only to solve the cube 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.699
 under the lamp and it had also been 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.289
 very edge told me to see if you can read and 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.699
 next time when you buy I do not know what 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.520
 I do not know how much and I could never buy anymore 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.849
 in that store man say be annoyed and 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.620
 then then they are typical and has 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.180
 courts want this good good good 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.680
 good you see here that it seems that we are 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.680
 entering slowly 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.300
 what is the birth of a galaxy 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.129
 here inside then there are the typical ones that 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.659
 the green colors are green 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.639
 disgusting and those who shine in the 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.779
 darkness but what about those are not 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.180
 they distinguish the colors but nothing happens 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.800
 you put a cube of rubik I put a photo 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.150
 out there you put a different pattern in 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.059
 each face and then you can solve it to 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.559
 dark not good you understand me be 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.059
 however, it is a cube of quality and not 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.400
 it has an exorbitant price, I do not know 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:05.249
 if they were 40 dollars or something like that or that is 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.749
 something affordable is not no is not no they are not I do not know 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:07.800
 how much the magazine cost but good 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:09.990
 I was insane 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.870
 here we have on the white face to see if 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.639
 we can see it and we do not stay here 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.860
 blind a very sad face not like you see 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.490
 here is a very interesting detail not 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.649
 here it's off it's worth very well here 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.539
 Turn on already has gone crazy to the camera 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:26.999
 please I'm sorry I know it's a lack 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.710
 of respect and now all to focus on if 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.890
 I put a hand 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.180
 good good, good, it's good, 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.400
 I was getting nervous this can not 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.600
 be not as I said is a quality cube 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.910
 it was a reasonable price and it's also 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.100
 perfect to solve in bed not me 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.750
 that I know you do not need light you put on the 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.340
 bed you solve it you can tell 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.840
 you can even use your problems 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.430
 of pillow also 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.980
 if it is true maybe a day 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.810
 next you get up a little misshapen no 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.630
 but good is a risk that there is 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.150
 take over and you're done this is what there is 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.550
 let's do here the magic touch no no 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.770
 it came out to me now yes it is good or whatever 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.750
 now we have here a fantastic 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.300
 lighting I say goodbye here with this 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.190
 cube so interesting but as always 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.900
 I 'm going to say goodbye with the best of all 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.000
 Here you can see what extreme beauty 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.770
 I hope you liked the video as 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.690
 always and 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.690
 if we see each other in another video
