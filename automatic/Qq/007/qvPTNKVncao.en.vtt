up<00:02:16.350> with<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.430> leg<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.970> way<00:02:18.230> pivot<00:02:19.230> my

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
up with one leg up this way pivot my

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
up with one leg up this way pivot my
foot<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.730> sink<00:02:21.180> down<00:02:21.480> low<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:22.410> inch

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
foot out and I sink down low one inch

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.920 
foot out and I sink down low one inch
off<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.770> ground<00:02:22.920> extend<00:02:23.550> my<00:02:23.670> arms<00:02:24.000> back<00:02:24.720> into

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
off the ground extend my arms back into

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.580 
off the ground extend my arms back into
the<00:02:25.080> santi<00:02:25.500> position<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:27.000> use<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:28.380> leg

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the santi position then use all my leg

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.420 
the santi position then use all my leg
power<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.190> explode<00:02:29.550> forward<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.010> soon<00:02:32.010> hit

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
power to explode forward and soon hit

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
power to explode forward and soon hit
this<00:02:32.610> way<00:02:32.820> here<00:02:33.560> we're<00:02:34.560> gonna<00:02:34.650> stop<00:02:34.920> right

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
this way here we're gonna stop right

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.690 
this way here we're gonna stop right
there<00:02:35.570> we'll<00:02:36.570> do<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> again

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
there we'll do it again

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
there we'll do it again
so<00:02:38.700> our<00:02:38.820> second<00:02:39.210> attempt<00:02:39.600> we<00:02:40.290> finished<00:02:40.680> off

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
so our second attempt we finished off

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610 
so our second attempt we finished off
section<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:42.660> right<00:02:43.050> side<00:02:43.290> forward

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
section one with right side forward

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.160 
section one with right side forward
punching<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.640> direction<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.050> is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
punching out this direction so this is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.340 
punching out this direction so this is
where<00:02:46.290> section<00:02:46.710> two<00:02:46.950> begins<00:02:47.370> from<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.690> put

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
where section two begins from here I put

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.310 
where section two begins from here I put
my<00:02:49.500> weight<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.400> block<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:51.170> okay<00:02:52.170> my

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
my weight back and I block in okay my

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.710 
my weight back and I block in okay my
left<00:02:52.530> hand<00:02:52.740> pulls<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.160> waist<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.730> step<00:02:54.480> back

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
left hand pulls to the waist I step back

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.740 
left hand pulls to the waist I step back
back<00:02:55.500> into<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.890> santi<00:02:56.370> position<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.600> that's

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
back into my santi position and that's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.230 
back into my santi position and that's
all<00:02:57.930> done<00:02:58.110> relatively<00:02:58.470> slowly<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> pull

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
all done relatively slowly then I pull

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.780 
all done relatively slowly then I pull
in<00:03:00.450> from<00:03:01.440> momentum<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.280> here<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.550> where

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
in from momentum and now here is where

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.810 
in from momentum and now here is where
the<00:03:02.880> explosive<00:03:03.420> part<00:03:03.660> begins

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the explosive part begins

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.040 
the explosive part begins
