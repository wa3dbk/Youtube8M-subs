00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I think additional 20% off so I was like

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
I think additional 20% off so I was like
ok<00:00:31.140> around<00:00:31.590> 90<00:00:31.920> something<00:00:32.130> dollars<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.669> think

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
ok around 90 something dollars I think

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.040 
ok around 90 something dollars I think
I'll<00:00:33.000> grab<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> bring<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.780> the
