00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a compressed format already your your

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.399 
a compressed format already your your
editor<00:01:06.750> has<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:08.900> unencoded<00:01:09.900> code<00:01:11.540> resample<00:01:12.540> up

editor has to unencoded code resample up
sample<00:01:13.950> down<00:01:14.159> sample<00:01:14.760> whatever<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:16.500> it's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sample down sample whatever and it it's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.560 
sample down sample whatever and it it's
one<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> things<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.270> throw<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
one of the things that will throw your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
one of the things that will throw your
audio<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.320> especially<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:19.920> you've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
audio way off especially if you've got a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
audio way off especially if you've got a
long<00:01:20.400> vlog<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.150> makes<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
long vlog so that makes it a little

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
long vlog so that makes it a little
harder<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> sync<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:26.310> impossible

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
harder to sync them up not impossible

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.960 
harder to sync them up not impossible
but<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.420> harder<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:29.369> course<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.700> depends

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but a little harder of course it depends

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.999 
but a little harder of course it depends
on<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.479> using<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.740> that
