00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello very good today it's time to talk about a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.680
 new racing video game in this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.600
 exclusive case of pc 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.580
 his name is assetto corset of the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.290
 Italian company q us simulation and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.210
 specialists in creating simulators 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.130
 driving both at the videogame level 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.199
 as in the form of professional programs 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 with very advanced physics for companies 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 who need it, focusing on the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 simulator slope understood as 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.980
 videogame have launched several proposals 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 on a small scale until now being 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 surely the best known the simulator 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 Formula 1 Ferrari official of the year 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 2010 ferrari virtual academy years before 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.369
 they tried it with net card but a game 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 focused on racing cars 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.850
 Pretty promotion categories 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
 unknown but with great success by 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.750
 part of the critique I accept corsa is its 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 first big project as a video game is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 announced in 2011 and it has been this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 same week at the beginning of November 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 2013 when the green light has been given to the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.149
 majority of the public to prove it with their 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.710
 launching of listing through the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 early access system that gives access to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 the games before being finished now 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.570
 same for 35 euros you get the game 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 complete once it is released and it gives you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 right to participate in this program of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 early access that is updated 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.899
 constantly in the first version 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 public asset or Corsican only 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.589
 we can compete against the clock not yet 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 options are available so 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.670
 single career career and the one that most 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
 will have that is the game 'online' we have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 at the moment five circuits to choose 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.190
 all fully licensed and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.560
 scanned by laser and 11 vehicles 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.820
 of all kinds have announced that they will leave 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.410
 updating the content of the game every 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 two weeks until you get to the version 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.920
 final and final so we will not have 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.870
 to wait long to see more options 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 and available variants is like already your 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.229
 you will put a very hard simulator that does not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.300
 look for something other than realism 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.520
 extreme placing itself in the line of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.410
 reflector and racing or gtr above 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.110
 more mixed proposals as it can be for 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.030
 the cast granturismo or forza motorsport a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.440
 Despite poor initial impression 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.060
 of little time you are realizing what 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.619
 insultingly worked minds that are 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.720
 the physics of the vehicles work 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.220
 of the suspensions is extraordinary 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 although it really is not extremely 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.100
 demanding at least with the cars that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.660
 we have tried so far to maintain 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 the vehicle itself inside the track to 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.110
 a normal rhythm is impossible in this 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 aspect say it's better or worse 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 simulator because to get an idea 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.869
 Exactly you would have to try the same car 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.759
 real on the same real circuit but it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.930
 see that he does not accuse of that extreme lack of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.640
 grip that if we see in certain 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.290
 situations in games like factor 2 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
 something that I personally loved 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.549
 is the interface 100% configurable even 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.020
 in real time while you run with so 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.910
 just move the mouse 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.800
 a menu is displayed with various 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 options such as times for 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.430
 turn basic car information hour 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.050
 of the day forces go position of the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330
 pedals for saying some not only 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.080
 we can activate and deactivate 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.150
 independently each section but 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.500
 that we can move freely around 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.850
 the screen and leave it where we see 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 timely where you better tell us 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.930
 we in addition to fix it and save it 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.580
 for later sessions an example of 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.470
 How much you appreciate something so 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.270
 basic and simple but so forgotten the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.280
 most videogames the game also 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.960
 will have in the future official support for 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 mods we can see the teachers of the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.470
 creation of cars and virtual circuits 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.000
 delight us with infinite content 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.680
 although one simulates action and has promised 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.480
 try to integrate them better in the game 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.550
 to avoid that feeling there are games 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.920
 as the factor of having everything too 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.660
 scattered is probably one of the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.490
 most interesting points of this seat 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.570
 Corsica we hope they really get 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.130
 that cohesion of the different 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.630
 modifications to make it not 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 too frustrating trying 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.800
 Compete online with content not created 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.690
 by the developer the game how you see 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.150
 is graphically at this point pretty 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.860
 justito is graphically butt in 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.630
 these videos that you see and yet it is 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.760
 pretty far from seen in videos 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.959
 old ones I want to think that it will improve 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 quite from here the launch though 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.420
 is 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 I really miss that the videos makes 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.930
 more than a year for example see a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.160
 image much sharper than the one 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.290
 you get in this first version of the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
 early access in particular is worrisome 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.290
 the lack of ante alexis or the evil 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.000
 operation of this same that causes 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.500
 those horrible saw teeth maybe 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.390
 Youtube is much more sneaky 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.040
 but believe me that live is pretty 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.510
 difficult to ignore although certainly not 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.099
 they affect far from the correct 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.180
 vision of the environment in terms of impact 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.560
 playable refers 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.030
 this is all for now I will try 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.650
 bring you as well as check cars 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.480
 videos in a more or less regular way 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 showing developments go 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.300
 introducing as I said have 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.799
 promised to update it every two weeks 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.930
 let's hope they meet it 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.489
 in the next few days we will test the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.260
 five circuits available so far 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.810
 with various cameras in the style of video 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.489
 in 4.0 that I made with project cards ago 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.640
 a few days thank you very much until 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.640
 then
