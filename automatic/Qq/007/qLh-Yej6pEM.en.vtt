one thing I do like on this keyboard is
as<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> saw<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:58.530> big<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.979> bar<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
as you saw there how big that bar is you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.050 
as you saw there how big that bar is you
know<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.350> huge<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
know it's not huge but it's not the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.569 
know it's not huge but it's not the
smalls<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.689> most<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.140> them<00:02:04.229> are<00:02:04.579> they're

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
smalls like most of them are they're

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.340 
smalls like most of them are they're
real<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:06.090> trying<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.020> solve

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
real you know trying to make you solve

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.160 
real you know trying to make you solve
the<00:02:07.950> 4.3<00:02:08.729> inch<00:02:08.879> screen<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.509> terms<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the 4.3 inch screen in terms of the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.780 
the 4.3 inch screen in terms of the
actual<00:02:10.349> height<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.220> base<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
actual height because base is to a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.040 
actual height because base is to a
little<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.090> fatter

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
little bit fatter

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.830 
little bit fatter
it<00:02:13.110> works<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.410> little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.650> better<00:02:15.330> but

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it works a little bit better but

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.330 
it works a little bit better but
basically<00:02:16.080> their<00:02:16.290> implementation<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.310> terms

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
basically their implementation in terms

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150 
basically their implementation in terms
of<00:02:17.760> swipe<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.650> obviously<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.860> go

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
of swipe is obviously you can just go

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.560 
of swipe is obviously you can just go
like<00:02:20.580> that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
like that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:37.820 
like that
hey<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:28.640> some<00:02:29.810> here<00:02:32.900> how<00:02:33.900> are<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:37.710> as

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
hey it's some here how are you now as

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.640 
hey it's some here how are you now as
you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:39.270> not<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.700> slide<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.880> put

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
you can see it's not the slide you put

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.800 
you can see it's not the slide you put
it's<00:02:43.650> not<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> most<00:02:44.070> accurate<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.470> fair<00:02:46.710> I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
it's not the most accurate to be fair I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.200 
it's not the most accurate to be fair I
don't<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.460> sounds<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.940> bit<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
don't like it I know it sounds a bit you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.640 
don't like it I know it sounds a bit you
know<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.360> don't<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.680> miss<00:02:53.490> uses<00:02:53.790> swipe

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
know I don't like it I miss uses swipe

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.620 
know I don't like it I miss uses swipe
an<00:02:55.650> image<00:02:56.400> because<00:02:56.910> obviously<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.270> way<00:02:57.300> that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
an image because obviously the way that

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.510 
an image because obviously the way that
you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.930> swipe<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.890> their<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.400> way

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
you know swipe not just their the way

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.360 
you know swipe not just their the way
they'd<00:02:59.700> actually<00:03:00.000> created<00:03:00.630> their<00:03:00.720> software

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
they'd actually created their software

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.210 
they'd actually created their software
it<00:03:02.370> works<00:03:02.730> whereas<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.800> have<00:03:04.800> problems<00:03:05.160> getting

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it works whereas I have problems getting

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.130 
it works whereas I have problems getting
certain<00:03:05.730> words<00:03:05.910> out<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.240> one<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:06.990> that

certain words out of this one now that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.590 
certain words out of this one now that
you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.650> custom<00:03:07.820> dictionary<00:03:08.820> words<00:03:09.060> like

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
you can do custom dictionary words like

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.770 
you can do custom dictionary words like
can<00:03:09.930> doing<00:03:10.170> swipe<00:03:10.380> as<00:03:10.590> well<00:03:10.770> but<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.180> mean

fast one
as<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.650> saw<00:03:34.860> there<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.489> guide<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:37.530> know

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
as you saw there you get guide you know

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.930 
as you saw there you get guide you know
I've<00:03:37.830> added<00:03:37.980> quite<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> few<00:03:38.489> times<00:03:38.730> on

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
I've added quite a few times on

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.440 
I've added quite a few times on
different<00:03:38.970> words<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.280> try<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.489> some<00:03:42.030> short

different words I try to do some short
words<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.989> gives<00:03:43.140> me<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.380> big<00:03:43.500> massive

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
words and it gives me like a big massive

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.920 
words and it gives me like a big massive
one<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.370> hang<00:03:44.910> on<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.209> didn't<00:03:45.630> want<00:03:45.780> that

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
one it's like hang on I didn't want that

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.330 
one it's like hang on I didn't want that
so<00:03:46.320> if<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.470> got<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.650> go<00:03:46.739> from<00:03:46.950> one<00:03:47.070> side<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
so if you got to go from one side to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.610 
so if you got to go from one side to
like<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.600> run<00:03:48.870> let<00:03:49.020> me<00:03:49.080> give<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> big

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
like that it run let me give you a big

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.770 
like that it run let me give you a big
words<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.040> first<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.600> sometimes<00:03:51.600> you've<00:03:51.690> got

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
words the first one sometimes you've got

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.030 
words the first one sometimes you've got
to<00:03:51.810> drill<00:03:52.050> down<00:03:52.200> into<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.560> together<00:03:52.680> one

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
to drill down into it together one

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.729 
to drill down into it together one
you're<00:03:53.160> actually<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:54.480> he<00:03:55.020> sitting<00:03:55.590> not

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739
