perspective<00:01:45.630> specifically<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
perspective specifically on the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.859 
perspective specifically on the
offensive<00:01:47.189> interference<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:48.329> thought<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
offensive interference I thought was the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.550 
offensive interference I thought was the
right<00:01:48.899> call<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:50.100> couldn't<00:01:50.729> tell<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.240> know<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
right call I couldn't tell you know and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.460 
right call I couldn't tell you know and
I<00:01:52.649> didn't<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.250> couldn't<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.290> video

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I didn't see it I couldn't see the video

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.039 
I didn't see it I couldn't see the video
so<00:01:56.040> i<00:01:56.310> don't<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.000> high<00:01:57.210> quality<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so i don't know but high quality is the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630
