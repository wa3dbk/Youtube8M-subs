00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.440
 enlighten is to share a power in 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.250
 special the power to improve the life of 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.330
 people 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.110
 Cities expand populations 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.420
 grow and the demand for light is every time 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.310
 higher 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.380
 and we need to respond to that 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.660
 requirement through a 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.810
 efficient lighting that allows 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.140
 save on energy consumption this can 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 get with the right technology this 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 is happening right now 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.140
 buenos aires land a city ​​that is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 re light 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.400
 Felix Argentina develops in the city 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.710
 of buenos aires a project 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.380
 transformer the replacement of your system 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.080
 of conventional lighting by new 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.890
 luminaires with technology to read from 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.890
 national manufacturing 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.050
 the ninety-one thousand points of light will be 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.770
 reconverted to read this amounts to 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.200
 improve light quality in 75% of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.690
 its avenues and streets and to turn on 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.690
 they the brightness of innovation 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.030
 technology it is present in the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.670
 lighting of the big centers 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.350
 urban their presence translates into 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.860
 important benefits for your 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.380
 inhabitants its sustainable approach is 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.090
 key in designing a solution to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.979
 long term in the fight against change 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.569
 climatic many cities are 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.659
 advancing in energy efficiency and 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.420
 this improves the quality of light and by 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.610
 another part increases the useful life of the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.060
 luminaires five times more with respect 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.789
 to the traditional ones on 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.700
 approximately 127 thousand that there is in the 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.170
 city via public the government plan 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.429
 from the city of Buenos Aires 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.140
 replace some 91,000 in 2015 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.200
 this replacement is very important 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.180
 several reasons and one of them 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.030
 that dioxide emissions are reduced 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.069
 carbon equivalent that generates the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.610
 climate change in 23 thousand 600 tons 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.209
 this savings equals the amount of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.990
 carbon sequestered from the atmosphere 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:30.330
 23 hectares of adult mature forests 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.910
 its proven energy efficiency 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.070
 the new lighting system reduces 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.010
 power consumption city 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.590
 140 gigawatts-hour per year less than the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.070
 half representing a saving of consumption 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 of approximately 50% this saving of 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.270
 energy equals all the consumption that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.000
 they have schools and hospitals 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.920
 the city ​​in addition these luminaries 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.710
 produce much less light pollution 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.260
 So much more comfort and safety at 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.540
 inhabitant of the city his savings in 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.850
 maintenance thanks to the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.790
 remote management the status of each luminaire 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.830
 can be monitored in real time by 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.230
 a wireless telemanagement system 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.080
 the technical representatives can 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.000
 control the ignition of the entire city 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.270
 vary the intensity according to 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.580
 needs and uses and can detect from 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.940
 Immediately any inconvenience 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.550
 timely your valuable contribution to safety 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.040
 the connection is direct where there is good 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.930
 light there is greater security white light 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.150
 issued by LEDs favors the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.340
 facial recognition and the correct 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.950
 perception of colors not only to 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.960
 simple sight but even in the cameras 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.120
 of security is proven that 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.820
 improving the capacity of vision 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560
 reinforces crime prevention is 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.940
 important to recover public spaces 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.940
 also at night 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.330
 I had not passed by here 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.090
 I come back from the facu 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.630
 Now I'm not afraid to go out to the avenue 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.610
 now it's something else 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.370
 They want to go running at night more 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.769
 continued 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.610
 In addition, the new lighting system 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.620
 public with Philips led luminaires 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.200
 will allow good airs to become 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.699
 in a smart city through the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.699
 integration with other systems 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.199
 the project buenos aires read is already in 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.270
 march this initiative places the 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.699
 city at the forefront in the world in 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.460
 terms of energy efficiency and 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.590
 greatly enhances your efforts 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.949
 for establishing itself as a city

 sustainable because of its positive effects on 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.320
 the whole of society and the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.129
 aled conversion really means a 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.189
 before 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.399
 a better-lit city ​​is a city 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.180
 more enjoyable and more reliable more 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:57.550
 old with the environment 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.009
 which can offer a higher quality of

 life to those who live in it the 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.949
 philips led technology is also 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.479
 embellishing facades and monuments 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.169
 communicating vitality and ability to 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:14.169
 innovation a new lighting is 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.430
 winning the streets improving the way 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.419
 to live the city 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.110
 buenos aires- buenos aires evolves 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:28.889
 grows transform Buenos Aires 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.889
 rewinds with philips led technology
