that when it's when it's some all the
way<00:01:16.530> fresh<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:18.659> freeze<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.740> if

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
way fresh so either freeze it or if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
way fresh so either freeze it or if
you're<00:01:20.640> thawing<00:01:20.939> frozen<00:01:21.060> chicken<00:01:21.869> don't

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
thought all the way let it come like

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.520 
thought all the way let it come like
this<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.619> much<00:01:26.040> easier<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.580> cut

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
this and then it's so much easier to cut

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
this and then it's so much easier to cut
okay<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> even<00:01:29.520> look<00:01:29.850> cut<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.690 
half when you've got a really thick
piece<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> cut<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.960> lengthwise<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.070> cut

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
piece so cut it lengthwise and then cut

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
piece so cut it lengthwise and then cut
cut<00:01:36.420> cut<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.700> rid<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> garbage<00:01:39.380> but

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
