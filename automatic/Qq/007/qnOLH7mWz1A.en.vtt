inches<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
inches and one more little line then you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.670 
inches and one more little line then you
would<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> paper<00:00:49.940> measure<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.270> up

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
would take it on the paper measure it up

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.720

then<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> half

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
then when you see three and a half

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.930 
then when you see three and a half
inches<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.230> line<00:00:55.640> mark<00:00:56.640> your

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
inches in one little line mark your

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.590 
inches in one little line mark your
place<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.420> fold<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
place then what you would do is fold it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.789 
place then what you would do is fold it
up<00:01:00.780> once<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.370> arm<00:01:02.870> crease<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.500> good

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
up once to that arm crease it very good

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
up once to that arm crease it very good
then<00:01:05.519> twice<00:01:09.080> three<00:01:10.080> times<00:01:12.470> four<00:01:13.470> times<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
then twice three times four times and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.030 
then twice three times four times and
then<00:01:15.390> instead<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> folding<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:18.420> way

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
then instead of folding it this way

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
then instead of folding it this way
where<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.640> no<00:01:21.320> line<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.820> take<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
where there is no line you would take it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.230 
where there is no line you would take it
and<00:01:25.170> fold<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and fold it this one what if there is a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
and fold it this one what if there is a
flat<00:01:28.220> now<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:31.229> should

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
flat now what you would do it should

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.969 
flat now what you would do it should
look<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.810> here's<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.110> here's<00:01:34.710> where

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
look like this here's the here's where

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.850 
look like this here's the here's where
it<00:01:35.070> opens<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.390> t.t<00:01:39.390> click<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.560> like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it opens and now t.t click it's like

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.780 
it opens and now t.t click it's like
this<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.729> those<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.299> flaps<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:44.549> should

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this and then those two flaps you should

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.929 
this and then those two flaps you should
take<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:46.700> take<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.030> tape<00:01:48.869> those<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.409> flaps

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
take it take the tape those two flaps

00:01:49.939 --> 00:02:01.300 
take it take the tape those two flaps
and<00:01:50.939> pull<00:01:51.720> them

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.660 

and<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.390> should<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:04.280> still<00:02:05.280> air

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670

and then you should have still air
pockets<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.870> catch<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.590> air<00:02:07.830> when<00:02:08.720> when<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
pockets to catch the air when when you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.770
