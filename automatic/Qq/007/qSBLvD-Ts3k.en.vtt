people have complained it when you flip

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.510 
people have complained it when you flip
this<00:03:06.210> up<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.750> pull<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.110> back<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:08.070> push<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
this up you pull it back and you push it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.270 
this up you pull it back and you push it
forward<00:03:09.000> again<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.540> might<00:03:09.690> hit<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.560> safety

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

forward again you might hit this safety
switch<00:03:11.520> but<00:03:12.270> on<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:12.780> had<00:03:12.960> reverse<00:03:13.320> this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
switch but on this they had reverse this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.230 
switch but on this they had reverse this
so<00:03:13.860> down<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:15.000> safe<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.650> fire<00:03:17.240> setup

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
so down is safe and up is fire setup

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that's about 175 dollars in USA so you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.990
