Cove<00:03:41.349> Island<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.790> course<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.190> last

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
Cove Island of course and that the last

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.699 
Cove Island of course and that the last
time<00:03:45.549> we<00:03:45.670> had<00:03:45.760> run<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.420> 1999<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.409> still

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
time we had run that was 1999 that still

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.009 
time we had run that was 1999 that still
had<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> strong<00:03:48.329> place<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.599> everybody's

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
had a strong place and everybody's

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.809 
had a strong place and everybody's
memory<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.159> reason<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.610> was

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
memory and the reason that was

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.580 
memory and the reason that was
discontinued<00:03:52.540> was<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.200> Canadian

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
discontinued was that the Canadian

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.309 
discontinued was that the Canadian
government<00:03:53.700> had<00:03:54.700> pulled<00:03:55.510> their<00:03:55.840> government

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
government had pulled their government

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.970 
government had pulled their government
buoy<00:03:56.470> at<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.980> location<00:03:57.370> right<00:03:57.849> so<00:03:58.510> we<00:03:59.230> looked

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
buoy at that location right so we looked

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.819 
buoy at that location right so we looked
around<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.549> we<00:04:00.730> still<00:04:01.120> had<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.750> buoy<00:04:02.500> from

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
around and we still had the buoy from

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.860 
around and we still had the buoy from
the<00:04:02.950> Southampton<00:04:03.190> course<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.060> we<00:04:04.180> ran<00:04:04.390> after

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
the Southampton course that we ran after

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.440 
the Southampton course that we ran after
that<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.470> we<00:04:06.280> pulled<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.700> all<00:04:06.819> together<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
that and we pulled it all together and

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.089 
that and we pulled it all together and
we're<00:04:07.989> gonna<00:04:08.049> have<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.349> service<00:04:08.680> bring<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:08.980> up

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
we're gonna have the service bring it up

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.379 
we're gonna have the service bring it up
there<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.310> we're<00:04:09.519> gonna<00:04:09.609> use<00:04:09.700> our<00:04:09.940> own<00:04:10.120> buoy

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
there so we're gonna use our own buoy

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.750 
there so we're gonna use our own buoy
okay<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.260> very<00:04:11.500> same<00:04:11.739> spot<00:04:11.889> so<00:04:12.459> it's<00:04:12.639> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
okay in the very same spot so it's a

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.550 
okay in the very same spot so it's a
classic<00:04:13.209> phrase<00:04:13.659> how<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.019> new<00:04:14.319> race<00:04:14.530> that's

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
classic phrase how a new race that's

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.529 
classic phrase how a new race that's
will<00:04:15.069> it's<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.310> six<00:04:15.609> horse<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:16.150> organ<00:04:16.419> has

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
will it's a six horse that organ has

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.449 
will it's a six horse that organ has
that<00:04:16.720> has<00:04:16.870> records<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.739> history<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that has records in history and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:18.930 
that has records in history and
everything<00:04:18.729> else

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
everything else

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.550 
everything else
yep<00:04:19.269> now<00:04:19.479> how<00:04:19.600> long<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.079> code<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.350> course

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
yep now how long is the code of course

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.300 
yep now how long is the code of course
the<00:04:21.340> Cova<00:04:22.150> course<00:04:22.560> -<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.740> would<00:04:23.889> ask<00:04:24.039> me<00:04:24.190> that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the Cova course - you would ask me that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.900 
the Cova course - you would ask me that
okay<00:04:24.490> -<00:04:25.090> 60<00:04:25.600> years<00:04:25.900> -<00:04:26.260> 64<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.010> think<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.580> yeah

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
okay - 60 years - 64 I think it is yeah

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.670 
okay - 60 years - 64 I think it is yeah
so<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.479> short<00:04:28.720> course<00:04:28.990> will<00:04:29.169> be<00:04:29.289> still<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so the short course will be still the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.990 
so the short course will be still the
code<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.190> short<00:04:30.430> course<00:04:30.669> straight<00:04:30.880> yeah

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
code just a short course straight yeah

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.020 
code just a short course straight yeah
it's<00:04:31.180> about<00:04:31.620> 45<00:04:32.620> miles<00:04:33.039> shorter<00:04:33.550> right<00:04:33.699> short

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
it's about 45 miles shorter right short

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.089 
it's about 45 miles shorter right short
course<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.630> goes<00:04:34.780> around<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.349> weather

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
course and that goes around the weather

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.980 
course and that goes around the weather
buoy<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.669> that'll<00:04:36.940> be<00:04:37.030> for<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.270> perf<00:04:37.479> classes

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
buoy and that'll be for the perf classes

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.250 
buoy and that'll be for the perf classes
or<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.910> perf<00:04:40.120> classes<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:41.020> there

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
or just know the perf classes and there

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.010 
or just know the perf classes and there
is<00:04:41.349> an<00:04:41.500> IRC<00:04:41.770> class<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.400> goes<00:04:42.550> on<00:04:42.789> that<00:04:43.060> not

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
is an IRC class that goes on that not

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.810 
is an IRC class that goes on that not
everybody<00:04:44.530> wanted<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:44.949> do<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.280> long<00:04:45.460> course
