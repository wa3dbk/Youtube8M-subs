00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
been yelling at me for my past video

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.110 
been yelling at me for my past video
where<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> used<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.460> straightener<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.090> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
where I used my straightener that I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
where I used my straightener that I
don't<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> do

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
don't use one so what we're going to do

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
don't use one so what we're going to do
is<00:00:43.950> start<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.340> piece<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:48.260> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is start with a piece in the back and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
is start with a piece in the back and
you're<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> straighten<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> forward

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you're going to straighten it forward

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
you're going to straighten it forward
now<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.050> said<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> last<00:00:52.649> video<00:00:53.070> when

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now like I said in the last video when

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040 
now like I said in the last video when
you're<00:00:53.820> straightening<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.360> hair<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.899> want

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you're straightening your hair you want

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.680 
you're straightening your hair you want
to<00:00:55.140> take<00:00:55.289> fairly<00:00:55.890> smaller<00:00:56.280> sections<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.390> comb

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to take fairly smaller sections the comb

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
to take fairly smaller sections the comb
helps<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> separates<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.340> hair<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
helps because it separates the hair and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
helps because it separates the hair and
makes<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.570> easier<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:00.989> each<00:01:01.289> hair<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
makes it easier for each hair to hit the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
makes it easier for each hair to hit the
straightener<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.910> shorter<00:01:03.239> pieces<00:01:03.660> it'll

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
straightener for shorter pieces it'll

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.230 
straightener for shorter pieces it'll
probably<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.920> easier<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> use<00:01:06.210> your

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
probably be easier just to use your

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.390 
probably be easier just to use your
fingers<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.650> keep<00:01:07.950> doing

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
fingers so you're just gonna keep doing

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.030 
fingers so you're just gonna keep doing
this<00:01:08.430> until<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.420> guess<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> front<00:01:10.260> quarter<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this until I guess the front quarter of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
this until I guess the front quarter of
your<00:01:11.159> hair<00:01:11.430> okay<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> front

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
your hair okay when you get to the front

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
your hair okay when you get to the front
you<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.710> half-crazy<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you look little half-crazy but in the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
you look little half-crazy but in the
corners<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.710> you're<00:01:17.100> gonna<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.549> these

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
corners here you're gonna take these

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
corners here you're gonna take these
pieces<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:20.869> straighten<00:01:21.869> them<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
pieces and straighten them up and in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
pieces and straighten them up and in
towards<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.299> middle<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.930> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
towards the middle and there's gonna be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
towards the middle and there's gonna be
a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.920> gonna<00:01:29.040> curl<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> little

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
a little you're gonna curl it a little

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
a little you're gonna curl it a little
bit<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> end<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.530> direction<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
bit at the end so that the direction of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
bit at the end so that the direction of
the<00:01:32.310> tops<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> hair<00:01:33.240> goes<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.720> okay<00:01:34.350> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the tops of the hair goes down okay so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
the tops of the hair goes down okay so
when<00:01:34.770> you're<00:01:34.920> doing<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> front<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> hair

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
when you're doing the front of the hair

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.319 
when you're doing the front of the hair
you're<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.670> hair<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you're going to take that hair and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
you're going to take that hair and
instead<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.350> forward<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.340> gonna

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
instead of going forward you're gonna

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
instead of going forward you're gonna
bring<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.540> curl<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> get

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
bring it back and curl it when you get

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
bring it back and curl it when you get
to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> end<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.759> usually<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.659> front<00:01:46.020> layers

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to the end I usually do two front layers

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
to the end I usually do two front layers
so<00:01:46.560> there's<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.040> row<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> then

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so there's one row back here and then

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.490 
so there's one row back here and then
the<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:48.990> front<00:01:49.860> row<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the very front row and when I do the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
the very front row and when I do the
very<00:01:52.799> front<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.329> little

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
very front it's kind of a little

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
very front it's kind of a little
difficult<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.140> hold<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> comb<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.219> use

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
difficult to hold the comb so I just use

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
difficult to hold the comb so I just use
my<00:01:56.399> fingers<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.530> close<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
my fingers and you go as close to the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
my fingers and you go as close to the
roots<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.850> without<00:02:00.030> burning<00:02:00.390> your

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
roots as you can without burning your

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.319 
roots as you can without burning your
scalp<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.369> bring<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> straightener

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
scalp and you bring the straightener

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.230 
scalp and you bring the straightener
straight<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.469> curve<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> get

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
straight back and curve it when you get

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.479 
straight back and curve it when you get
to<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> end<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> makes<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> kind

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to the end so that it makes like a kind

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.850 
to the end so that it makes like a kind
of<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.530> you're<00:02:10.770> gonna

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
need to twist it a little bit

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.440
