00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.110
 for eight years all the clubs 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.360
 rotary de france with whom 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.340
 now 2 Belgian clubs 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.160
 Luxembourgish organizes every year 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.320
 the preview of a film for the purpose 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.880
 to participate in research on the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.110
 brain 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.500
 the sports operation in mind was launched in 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.140
 2005 thanks to the will of the governors 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 from that era who decided to create 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.370
 a national operation 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.250
 they immediately thought of diseases 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.260
 who systematically hit 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 many rotarian families where 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.200
 many families 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.480
 of our fellow citizens in the brain 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 seemed something that could 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 lead to a channeling of the efforts 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 March 12, 2013 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.860
 the presence of several thousand 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 spectators 95 thousand places were 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 sold which provided a profit of 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 the order of 950 5000 euros this sum has 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.070
 been formally submitted on 8 June 2013 to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 the town hall of nancy 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 these nine hundred and fifty five thousand euros 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.430
 have been fully redistributed by our 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.380
 researchers selected in partnership 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.070
 with the scientific committee of the inverted 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.890
 is selected with the shares the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 participation of rotarians who deals 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.630
 to see if the projects have no 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.550
 connotation I would say business so 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 that we stay perfectly in the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.190
 rotarian tic and that our different 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 researchers be awarded for quality 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.900
 of their project and of course to help the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.490
 fondamental research 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.200
 project selection and based in 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.650
 much about quality

 foreigners who are going 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.400
 evaluate his projects other criterion 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.590
 important is originality 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.080
 and also the technical quality of the

 platform that is being considered of course 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.290
 the aspect structuring the aspect 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.340
 collaborative is so important 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.739

 national operation of the rotary club of 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.579
 France over six and a half million 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.109
 euros have been allocated to 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.230
 brain research 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.159
 take the example of chu de nancy for 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.079
 further detail the employment of 7 Apr 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.959
 a delegation of the rotary clubs of the big 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.109
 was able to meet the winning team 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.840
 from 2013 to we are today in 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.960
 one of the cutting - edge disciplines of chu de 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.070
 nancy in neurology and particularly 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.280
 on the exploration sector 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.130
 functional which is centered on 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.810
 electroencephalography 750 thousand 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.120
 people around in France are 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.810
 with epilepsy and in this group 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.210
 epilepsy 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.979
 there are epilepsies that are resistant to 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.570
 medical treatment and when 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.030
 epilepsy is resistant to treatment 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.280
 medical that's where maybe a 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.380
 surgical solution can be 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.260
 proposed and that's all the interest is 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.539
 many achievements that are being made 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.340
 right now as part of the 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.590
 research and applications in 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.949
 activity of choice and especially what is 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.510
 important from there is that 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.400
 intervention and methods 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.680
 investigation will allow us to 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.240
 better understand better understand 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.530
 certain aspects of the functioning 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.300
 cerebral 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.770
 this is the domain of the rock 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.930
 currently we have two axes of 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.160
 search in the team a first axis 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.350
 who is 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.270
 which aims to try to 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.940
 locate the starting point of crises 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.530
 non-invasively using 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.790
 tools we call the tools of 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.830
 source localization 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.020
 and then we have a second axis that 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.520
 develops in partnership so with the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.960
 research center in automatic from 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.060
 nancy the University of Lorraine and the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.640
 cnrs which aims to understand 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.800
 the brain mechanisms of 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.410
 face recognition at once 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.940
 from a perceptual point of view and in the 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.830
 memory how when we see a 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.690
 nobody in the street we are able 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.940
 to identify his face to recognize 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.410
 her features and then to recognize her 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.790
 as a person who is familiar or 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.200
 on the contrary we meet for the 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.639
 first 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.680
 the interest of what they can 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.620
 the eyebrow of creep it's them 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.810
 really allow to study 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.759
 time-scale process it 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.949
 occurs in the brain that is to say from 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.300
 the order of the millisecond a mini 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.490
 seconds after noon second we can 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.529
 study the progress of activities 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.960
 cerebral we serve as and when 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.729
 measure as the subject for example 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.529
 recognizes rebuilds the costs of a 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.779
 turn and then able to the 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.099
 differentiate another visual object then 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.919
 finally she recognizes as a 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.289
 familiar face where a family they 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.509
 will ultimately be the follow-up given to 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.400
 accomplished work and especially what is going 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.110
 serve the money that was given to you then 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.520
 a team part is here represented 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.379
 is not that four to they are always 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.840
 at work they are looking for they are looking for 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.529
 to good too much and so there is the team of 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.580
 cnrs the team of professor didier wolf 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.740
 the signal processing team 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.379
 there are the neurosurgeons there go 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.120
 neuroradiologist there is isotopic there 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.069
 there are neuropsychologists so there are 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.259
 forty people who 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.939
 regularly work on this topic 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.680
 and this subject when you have it very well 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:00.169
 explained professor louis maillard 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.729
 will truly allow us to better 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.629
 understand part of the operation 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.310
 of memory 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.620
 so it's way beyond 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.539
 epilepsy and treatment of patients 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.020
 with certain form of epilepsy 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.300
 epilepsy 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.649
 but it is also better to understand the 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.139
 memory operation by 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:15.949
 through the understanding of a 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.990
 face memory 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:23.060
 we may have extrapolations to 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:25.370
 to do on why not 'the announcement the 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.229
 prediction of certain diseases 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.149
 neurodegenerative maybe like the 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:31.639
 Alzheimer's disease and this will be done 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.649
 little by little, the research work 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.129
 it takes ideas in the beginning it takes 

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:36.740
 equipment 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:38.509
 it requires means thanks to the rotary of 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.069
 to have brought us is thanks to you 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.710
 we could do that 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.740
 we started six years ago already 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.310
 thanks to your talent you have been the 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.009
 pacemaker 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.889
 as we say, that is to say the starter who 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.780
 allowed 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:53.780
 to help us thanks again to the rotary
