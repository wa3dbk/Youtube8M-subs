00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
this really cool piece of technology

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.119 
this really cool piece of technology
that<00:00:48.400> was<00:00:49.360> used<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.870> create<00:00:50.170> art<00:00:50.530> in<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:50.769> simple

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
that was used to create art in a simple

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.670 
that was used to create art in a simple
and<00:00:51.160> very<00:00:51.640> beautiful<00:00:51.760> way<00:00:52.059> I'm<00:00:52.930> not<00:00:53.199> sure<00:00:53.260> that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
and very beautiful way I'm not sure that

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.170 
and very beautiful way I'm not sure that
there<00:00:54.010> was<00:00:54.100> any<00:00:54.280> preconceived<00:00:54.699> notion<00:00:55.089> that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
there was any preconceived notion that

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.670 
there was any preconceived notion that
he<00:00:55.269> was<00:00:55.390> showing<00:00:55.600> me<00:00:55.839> this<00:00:55.989> thinking<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.559> it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
he was showing me this thinking that it

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.200 
he was showing me this thinking that it
would<00:00:56.800> suddenly<00:00:56.979> show<00:00:57.190> up<00:00:57.370> in<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.760> band<00:00:57.970> room

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
would suddenly show up in the band room

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.990 
would suddenly show up in the band room
the<00:00:59.110> process<00:00:59.650> was<00:00:59.920> really<00:01:00.280> kind<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.699> surreal

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.820 
the process was really kind of surreal
and<00:01:01.269> everything<00:01:01.659> sort<00:01:01.839> of<00:01:01.930> aligned<00:01:02.320> in<00:01:02.620> such<00:01:02.769> a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
and everything sort of aligned in such a

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.280 
and everything sort of aligned in such a
way<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.339> band<00:01:03.879> parent<00:01:04.239> who<00:01:04.360> also<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> regional

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
around and like where is that music

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.320 
around and like where is that music
coming<00:01:53.530> from<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.789> instrument<00:01:55.299> is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
coming from like what instrument is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.290 
coming from like what instrument is
making<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.840> no<00:01:56.289> it's<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> support<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.909> it's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
making that no it's the support so it's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.809 
making that no it's the support so it's
something<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.380> new<00:01:59.679> that<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.069> lot<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.580> people

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
something so new that a lot of people

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.620 
something so new that a lot of people
never<00:02:01.000> heard<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.340> Seaboard<00:02:03.700> has<00:02:04.000> obviously

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
never heard the Seaboard has obviously

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690 
never heard the Seaboard has obviously
the<00:02:04.780> feel<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:04.990> keyboards<00:02:05.649> it's<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.220> old<00:02:06.399> part

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
the feel of keyboards it's that old part

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.100 
the feel of keyboards it's that old part
but<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.030> there's<00:02:07.240> all<00:02:07.420> these<00:02:07.539> new<00:02:07.600> sounds

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
but then there's all these new sounds

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.660 
but then there's all these new sounds
you<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.319> do<00:02:08.470> with<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.069> think<00:02:09.190> when<00:02:09.640> you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
you can do with it so I think when you

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.479 
you can do with it so I think when you
take<00:02:10.569> somebody<00:02:10.929> who<00:02:11.230> plays<00:02:11.410> piano<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.250> has

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
take somebody who plays piano and has

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.040 
take somebody who plays piano and has
that<00:02:12.760> background<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.450> mix<00:02:13.690> with<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that background and mix with the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.449 
that background and mix with the
Seaboard<00:02:14.470> you're<00:02:14.800> gonna<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.130> whole<00:02:15.340> new

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
Seaboard you're gonna get a whole new

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.640 
Seaboard you're gonna get a whole new
sound<00:02:15.670> that's<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.390> very<00:02:16.870> cool<00:02:17.080> thing<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.440> think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
sound that's a very cool thing I think

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.190 
sound that's a very cool thing I think
one<00:02:18.580> day<00:02:18.790> mr.<00:02:19.150> Dawson<00:02:19.480> who<00:02:19.630> pulled<00:02:19.930> me<00:02:20.080> aside

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
one day mr. Dawson who pulled me aside

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.259 
one day mr. Dawson who pulled me aside
and<00:02:20.739> showed<00:02:21.069> me<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.730> Seaboard<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.180> was

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.730 

they<00:05:03.360> set<00:05:03.659> pianos<00:05:04.080> like<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.379> king<00:05:04.620> of

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
they set pianos like the king of

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.649 
they set pianos like the king of
instruments<00:05:05.400> like<00:05:06.150> this<00:05:06.300> seaboard<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.439> and

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
instruments like this seaboard is and

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.159 
instruments like this seaboard is and

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.399 
for his servants
it<00:05:13.169> makes<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:13.740> musicians<00:05:14.310> who<00:05:14.460> play<00:05:14.759> it
