00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 we have postulated there are people who 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.920
 they've been waiting for years for years 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.920
 and these houses are voted on 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.909
 we do not if we have so much need 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.950
 of a house for years and here the case 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.630
 of camps per year nothing 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.630
 we do not decide to come sing 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.260
 and well it's something they look to help them to the bone 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:30.350
 I live in enrique molina in frutillar 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.210
 I looked at this 24 years ago 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.300
 I'm trying to control my house 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 every time he applied for a committee in which 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 we participate 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.310
 I could say that disaster posits 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.590
 a little bit and also gets rid of 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.590
 boredom or not the silver was placed 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 another does not work in the end dies 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.820
 last business of the bank of the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.820
 houses 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.130
 are the things 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.709
 at home 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.980
 my name is cristian gonzÃ¡lez i am from 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 take the strawberry sector and I'm 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.790
 tired of waiting for committee solutions 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 because I've been 12 years or so 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.420
 committee of one committee in another because the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.020
 people in the end are bored waiting and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.330
 wait and we make this decision to come 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.980
 here because these houses had more 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.170
 like 10 years fly then we already take 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.400
 the decision of this the street and here I love 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.700
 fight until the end just because 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.360
 imagine I see the elaboration san 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.520
 josÃ© better known as the swinton face and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.760
 it turns out that arrived has arrived in the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.550
 missionary house and there are houses there 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.410
 unemployed who did not try to fight for 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.060
 can get some and there is no 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.220
 solution 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.819
 I have my daily passbook 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.430
 I have and I'm listening to social protection 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.080
 I've gone to Serbian to fly to the house 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.600
 result 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.310
 one as a person sometimes has to 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.320
 learn one puts the speech of the notebook 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.320
 he takes it out and in the end he does not know what to do 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.030
 help to apply for the subsidy 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.720
 housing of used house no more 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.980
 results will not need to live 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.010
 It has reached a super situation 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.420
 uncomfortable a vulnerable situation 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.709
 totally and I have to give it a roof 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.390
 my son because they do not bode them in 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.330
 conditions in which I am living 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.780
 now there are no committees that are good 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.340
 take 15 13 12 years pasting a home 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.210
 enough time I think to have a 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.210
 normal response 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.459
 mayor lady of take that should be 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.190
 which now in the minutes as the first 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.740
 person supporting we are winds 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.350
 people that when they needed are 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.140
 of our votes people who believed in 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.519
 she supported it and we hope that 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.110
 she gives us back her hand at least 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.200
 with the presence of question of 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.420
 inquire about worrying this one is just 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.950
 is the support I needed just one 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.140
 we need support from the authority because 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.540
 we want to do things well and 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.010
 for that we need people who 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.040
 they are in charge good because a bad 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.360
 information makes people talk 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.060
 things that are not 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.260
 not just guilty or the guilty that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.740
 report 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.440
 I want to ask you to give us the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.310
 opportunity to hear us know 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.490
 that is not like that we do not come here to 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.780
 stay to do nothing if we 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.360
 we need to pay 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.530
 because we have to do and pay with 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.450
 our homes we are 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.370
 willing not only to die reach 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.630
 years that's why we're running in 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.430
 committees because if we had 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.590
 dear home for free not even us 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.150
 we take out savings book then not 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.130
 I want you to know that maybe they do not 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.480
 they know it or maybe they have other 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.370
 means but it's really those 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.110
 families who can not wait any longer and 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.310
 they can not wait anymore then like me 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.960
 I ask that if they are in the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.120
 same conditions of us that we 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.669
 support these things and support us because 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.230
 this is also going to be a help for 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.060
 they will be a tug on the ear for 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.570
 the authorities that also with the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.570
 children too 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.370
 do not settle there is no need 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.960
 settle for wanted to wait there's no 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.180
 What to expect more from the solution is that 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.010
 at the time there are many families then 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.420
 I ask you to support us not us 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.860
 criticize because this is going to help 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.570
 they also in two minutes and I know 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.980
 some minute they need support 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.720
 of the group that is here we are 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.210
 willing because we all need a 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.310
 place where to live in our right 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.440
 it's take for me means something that my 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.440
 daughters are going to have something that I had 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:08.370
 so much for our children 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.670
 as well as I here solution instead 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.530
 Now I 'm trying to help my 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.770
 daughter for her to have in her house and 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.500
 so that they do not happen what I went through and 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.070
 I'm here and I'm going to fight until 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.070
 she has in her house 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.130
