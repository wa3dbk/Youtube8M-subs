00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and hello to all my dear friends subscribers 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.529
 and the audience of my channel with you as always 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.410
 I would xi today I would like to show you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.170
 how to get rid of the problem when you have 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 nothing just starts 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.930
 occurs or writes that the application 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.119
 some error will be closed there 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.420
 Some of this error occurs due to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.000
 so that you most likely have two 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 video cards on your computer let's 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 I will show you by my example here you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 me windows of course spanish you on 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.710
 Russian but essentially does not change everything is done 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.070
 equally you will most likely be here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.680
 two video cards your gaming and built 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 in order to start the game there 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.350
 now i will try let's click play 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 as you can see nothing happens the game is not 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.190
 running nothing works for this 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.600
 we need to do first 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.359
 come here as I said here 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.670
 turn off your main 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.909
 the video card on my example is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 geforce gtx660 I just turn it off on 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.110
 time of the battle before disconnecting run 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.240
 here we run a social club 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 now it should start ok and immediately 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 turn our card back our 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 the card is turned on and now we have a game 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.090
 will start using exactly this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 the video card of our main gaming is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.040
 first to carry a solution to the problem with 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.040
 by launching 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.160
 there is still the second solution is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 when the club got down you just haven't 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.680
 progrugaetsya so let me get out of here 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 I will not play now so game second 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.910
 the problem is when the club came down just 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.280
 you get a permanent download 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.040
 This is also the most popular 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
 problem as it is also solved now i 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.399
 you try to show our go our 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.040
 computer we go if you have windows 7 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.310
 then go into the document and choose here 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.380
 any folder battlefield obsalyutno 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.540
 for example i will take and here you will be path 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.990
 most likely you will have it not like u 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.990
 me 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.500
 you will be here users there is your name 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.600
 user and if you can not change 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.420
 need your username 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.120
 exactly on latin latin layout 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.489
 yes if you can't change your name 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.150
 user can do the following 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.560
 I will show it to you now. 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.489
 here as you can see this address should be 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 ideally we go to the price disc we create 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.880
 here I create a folder on my example as 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:03.440
 it was written my documents will try 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:08.870
 just a dog and that means we have here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:13.140
 created daddy yes we go here yes 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.570
 copy the path further on to your 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.310
 documents where you are most likely now 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.860
 you needed to scroll through after the user 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.000
 where here you will have documents then 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.580
 have rewind back 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.110
 select a folder with documents where it will be 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.940
 write my papers 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.760
 click here properties and here we have 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.060
 go to tab to tab 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.660
 here and here is just what i am 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.750
 copied paste well dock folder which 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.500
 I created then click apply 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.340
 will ask you to move and all the files in 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.030
 this folder but 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.310
 we click yes and will you have after 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.550
 this will be loaded social club 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.629
 but this is probably the most common 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.849
 At this at this stage of the launch of the game 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.390
