the deaths or the blood s rates which
were<00:02:29.220> also<00:02:29.750> highlighted<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.959> quick

there<00:02:34.170> may<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.319> better<00:02:34.620> locations<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.910> then

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
there may be better locations but then

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.259 
there may be better locations but then
again<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.780> Dave<00:02:36.989> really<00:02:37.620> sky<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.700> check

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
again this is a Dave really sky so check

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.960 
again this is a Dave really sky so check
that<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.799> but<00:02:40.799> those<00:02:41.069> locations<00:02:41.459> which<00:02:41.760> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that out but those locations which I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.690 
that out but those locations which I
highlighted<00:02:42.540> will<00:02:43.170> work<00:02:43.410> anyways<00:02:44.190> over<00:02:44.519> here

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
highlighted will work anyways over here

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180 
highlighted will work anyways over here
I<00:02:44.730> did<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> ten-minute<00:02:45.630> sampling<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:47.010> did

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
I did a ten-minute sampling and this did

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
I did a ten-minute sampling and this did
match<00:02:47.430> other<00:02:48.030> samples<00:02:48.510> which<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.780> had<00:02:48.959> ran

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
match other samples which I had ran

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.780 
match other samples which I had ran
beforehand<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.160> actually<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.579> time

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
beforehand but this one actually is time

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.559 
beforehand but this one actually is time

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
data that in fact you know in this

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.039 
data that in fact you know in this
particular<00:02:57.510> instance<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.349> gain<00:02:59.269> 55.7<00:03:00.269> k<00:03:00.720> an

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
particular instance I gain 55.7 k an

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.680 
particular instance I gain 55.7 k an
hour<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.190> take<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> look<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.879> my<00:03:03.030> ten<00:03:03.299> minute

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
hour if you take a look at my ten minute

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.830 
hour if you take a look at my ten minute
rate<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:04.769> multiply<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.220> by<00:03:05.400> six<00:03:05.840> but

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
rate and then multiply that by six but

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.680 
rate and then multiply that by six but
yeah<00:03:06.959> basically<00:03:07.170> between<00:03:07.980> 50<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.640> 60<00:03:09.450> k<00:03:09.629> an

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
yeah basically between 50 to 60 k an

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.699 
yeah basically between 50 to 60 k an
hour<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:11.040> very<00:03:11.459> reasonable<00:03:12.420> rate<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.500> what

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
hour is a very reasonable rate of what

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.619 
hour is a very reasonable rate of what
you<00:03:13.829> should<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.400> able<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.700> expect<00:03:15.090> from<00:03:15.360> these

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
slower and pay attention to what was

slower and pay attention to what was
actually<00:04:09.870> typing<00:04:10.319> but<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> information

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.229 
is captured in voice and in the video
description<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:14.609> should<00:04:14.849> be<00:04:14.880> able<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.150> get

follow-on<00:04:19.049> videos<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:20.489> was<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:21.000> guide<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.630> I

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
follow-on videos this was a guide that I

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.810 
follow-on videos this was a guide that I
pulled<00:04:22.320> together<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.770> first<00:04:22.950> day<00:04:23.250> so

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
pulled together the first day so

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.909 
pulled together the first day so
hopefully<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.659> experience<00:04:25.229> rates<00:04:25.469> don't<00:04:25.740> get

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
hopefully the experience rates don't get

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.670 
hopefully the experience rates don't get
nerfed

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
nerfed

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.529 
nerfed
but<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.520> really<00:04:27.970> really<00:04:28.210> good

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
but this is really really good

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.360 
but this is really really good
experience<00:04:28.810> right<00:04:29.289> so<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.560> wouldn't<00:04:29.919> be<00:04:30.070> too

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
experience right so it wouldn't be too

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.659 
experience right so it wouldn't be too
surprised<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:32.050> did<00:04:32.530> get<00:04:32.710> nerfed<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.340> some

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
surprised if it did get nerfed to some

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.360 
surprised if it did get nerfed to some
extent<00:04:34.090> because<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:35.259> is<00:04:35.470> just<00:04:35.500> really

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
extent because this is just really

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.810 
extent because this is just really
awesome<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.900> downside<00:04:38.440> unlike<00:04:38.979> zmi<00:04:39.460> or<00:04:39.669> any

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
awesome the downside unlike zmi or any

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.270 
awesome the downside unlike zmi or any
other<00:04:40.030> kind<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.419> runecrafting<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:42.009> you

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
other kind of runecrafting is that you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800 
other kind of runecrafting is that you
don't<00:04:42.520> gain<00:04:42.699> any<00:04:42.910> profits<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:43.630> it's

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
don't gain any profits so it's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.370 
don't gain any profits so it's
completely<00:04:44.100> loss<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.430> profit<00:04:45.880> but<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.509> reward

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
completely loss of profit but the reward

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.260 
completely loss of profit but the reward
points<00:04:47.889> can<00:04:47.949> be<00:04:48.220> used<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.669> buy<00:04:48.789> some<00:04:49.030> pretty
