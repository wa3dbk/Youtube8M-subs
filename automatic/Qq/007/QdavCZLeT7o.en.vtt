60 is preferable though so that's my

you want to look at it and so first we

you want to look at it and so first we
first<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.899> reduce<00:00:51.899> lag<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.379> render

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
first way to reduce lag is render

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
first way to reduce lag is render
distance<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.420> render<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.350> normal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
distance you can render it on normal

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.250 
distance you can render it on normal
that's<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.940> FPS<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.660> need<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that's my FPS we need to put it on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
that's my FPS we need to put it on
normal<00:00:58.559> fog<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.370> render<00:00:59.760> distance<00:01:00.440> 35<00:01:01.969> 30<00:01:02.969> 35

normal fog or render distance 35 30 35
range<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:07.189> short<00:01:08.420> which

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
graphics too fast your grass will look a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.550 
graphics too fast your grass will look a
lot<00:01:37.350> different<00:01:37.549> your<00:01:38.549> trees<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.750> also<00:01:40.229> look

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
lot different your trees will also look

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
lot different your trees will also look
more<00:01:41.490> thick<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.909> clouds<00:01:45.329> are

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
more thick and in it your clouds are

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.020 
more thick and in it your clouds are
thin<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.920> those<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> main

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
thin that's those are the main

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.850 
thin that's those are the main
differences<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.869> try<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> fast<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
differences when they try to fast and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
differences when they try to fast and
fancy<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:51.840> FPS<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.549> fancy<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fancy and this is my FPS and fancy it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
fancy and this is my FPS and fancy it's
also<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.290> hot<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.979> fancy<00:01:56.460> fast

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
also a little bit hot and not fancy fast

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.719 
also a little bit hot and not fancy fast
but<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.630> higher<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.979> yeah

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
but it's a little bit higher but yeah

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
but it's a little bit higher but yeah
it's<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:01.259> better<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.490> put<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> hook

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
it's it's better you put it the hook

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.069 
it's it's better you put it the hook
wrap<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> fast<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> absolutely<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
wrap as a fast if you absolutely have to

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
wrap as a fast if you absolutely have to
another<00:02:07.079> way<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.849> turn<00:02:08.849> smooth<00:02:09.270> lighting

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

another<00:02:33.569> way<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.019> turn<00:02:34.319> your<00:02:34.590> performances

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
another way is to turn your performances

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.220 
another way is to turn your performances
you<00:02:35.519> have<00:02:35.730> balance<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.720> balance<00:02:37.079> out<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you have balance to balance out the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.259 
you have balance to balance out the
performance<00:02:37.859> in<00:02:38.129> between<00:02:38.760> different<00:02:39.060> things

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
as you can see on this pie graph that's

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.140 
as you can see on this pie graph that's
over<00:02:41.189> here<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.989> put<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.560> max<00:02:43.859> FPS<00:02:44.370> power

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
bouncing the FPS so that's max max FPS

it to balanced the pie graph looks
pretty<00:03:16.139> similar<00:03:16.430> I'll<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.669> a<00:03:17.699> war<00:03:17.970> FPS<00:03:18.829> so

those<00:04:31.360> pesky<00:04:31.660> low<00:04:31.900> clouds<00:04:32.230> are<00:04:32.470> gone<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.950> the

those pesky low clouds are gone and the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.160 
those pesky low clouds are gone and the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.790 
gay message doesn't have to run their
mouth<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:36.640> yeah<00:04:37.450> it's<00:04:37.810> also<00:04:38.020> harder<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.590> find

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
to decrease that is a decreased amount

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.030 
to decrease that is a decreased amount
of<00:05:07.240> particle<00:05:07.630> effects<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.440> lot<00:05:08.590> less<00:05:08.800> as

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
of particle effects it's a lot less as

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.890 
of particle effects it's a lot less as
you<00:05:09.190> can<00:05:09.310> see<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:10.120> will<00:05:10.300> fire<00:05:10.540> various

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
you can see that will fire various

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.290 
you can see that will fire various
things<00:05:11.140> also<00:05:11.440> part<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.890> effect<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.460> when<00:05:13.150> you

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
things also part of effect and when you

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.290 
things also part of effect and when you
put<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.870> minimal<00:05:14.350> all<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.880> will<00:05:16.060> slowly

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
put it to minimal all of it will slowly

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.500 
put it to minimal all of it will slowly
fade<00:05:16.690> away<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.230> value<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.160> torch<00:05:18.520> joking

minimal<00:05:20.350> part<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.710> effects<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.550> basically

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
minimal part of effects so basically

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.540 
minimal part of effects so basically

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
effects as you can see but when you put

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.680

there's<00:05:50.500> a<00:05:50.650> lot<00:05:50.770> more<00:05:51.010> particle<00:05:51.820> effects

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
there's a lot more particle effects

there's a lot more particle effects
portunity<00:05:58.950> as<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.940> see<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.450> all<00:06:01.720> those

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
portunity as you see that all those

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.010 
portunity as you see that all those
little<00:06:02.500> particles<00:06:03.150> those<00:06:04.150> are<00:06:04.360> all<00:06:04.450> particle

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
little particles those are all particle

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.230 
little particles those are all particle
effects<00:06:05.410> and<00:06:05.560> that<00:06:06.100> can<00:06:06.310> whack<00:06:06.550> your<00:06:06.760> computer

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
