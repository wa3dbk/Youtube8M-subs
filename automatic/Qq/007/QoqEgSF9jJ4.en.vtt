we do got 152 shows we have new england

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.980 
we do got 152 shows we have new england
and<00:00:17.820> then<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.240> west<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.630> Rockies

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
and then we have west of the Rockies

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.230 
and then we have west of the Rockies
pretty<00:00:19.260> much<00:00:19.439> nailed<00:00:19.710> down<00:00:22.490> we<00:00:23.490> developed<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
pretty much nailed down we developed the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.060 
pretty much nailed down we developed the
acoustic<00:00:24.750> trio<00:00:24.960> since<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.619> really<00:00:25.859> good

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
acoustic trio since it's a really good

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
acoustic trio since it's a really good
way<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.250> people<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> latch<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> what

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
way for people to latch on to what

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
way for people to latch on to what
you're<00:00:27.630> doing<00:00:27.900> has<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.470> personality<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you're doing has that personality to it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
you're doing has that personality to it
it's<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.179> close<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.980> found<00:00:35.010> really

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
it's up close I think we found really

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
it's up close I think we found really
quick<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.450> our<00:00:36.570> harmonies<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.230> our

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
quick that our harmonies are our

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440 
quick that our harmonies are our
strengths<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.610> allows<00:00:38.879> us<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> great

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
strengths it just allows us for a great

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
strengths it just allows us for a great
blend<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.590> easiest<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
blend that way the easiest way to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
blend that way the easiest way to
highlight<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> strip<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.300> down<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
highlight that was to strip it down and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900 
highlight that was to strip it down and
make<00:00:42.809> sure<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.530> heard<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.950> there

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
make sure they could be heard and there

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
make sure they could be heard and there

mixers is uncomfortable the reason that
we're<00:01:36.630> able<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> soundcheck<00:01:37.320> usually<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.860> like

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
we're able to soundcheck usually in like

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
we're able to soundcheck usually in like
10<00:01:38.310> minutes<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> presets<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
10 minutes is because of the presets and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
10 minutes is because of the presets and
then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.009> gives<00:01:41.100> us<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.909> kind

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
then it gives us more time to just kind

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.429 
then it gives us more time to just kind
of<00:01:42.210> relax<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> focus<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> performance
