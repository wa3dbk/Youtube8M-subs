so<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:46.000> prophecy<00:02:46.629> says<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.650> Spirit<00:02:48.040> is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
so my prophecy says that the Spirit is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.039 
so my prophecy says that the Spirit is
eternal<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.970> lives<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.329> forever

whatever happens to our body for a

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.149 
whatever happens to our body for a
little<00:02:51.940> doesn't<00:02:52.359> matter<00:02:52.510> although<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.980> not
