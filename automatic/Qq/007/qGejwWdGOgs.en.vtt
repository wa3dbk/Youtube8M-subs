looked pastel pink on the website but

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.460 
looked pastel pink on the website but
it's<00:02:55.180> actually<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.720> sherbert<00:02:56.200> color

which<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> kind<00:02:57.520> of<00:02:57.640> don't<00:02:57.910> mind<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:58.390> was

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
which I kind of don't mind I was

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.910 
which I kind of don't mind I was
stepping<00:02:58.690> out<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:58.990> comfort<00:02:59.050> zone<00:02:59.410> even

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
stepping out of my comfort zone even

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.350 
stepping out of my comfort zone even

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
though this isn't the color I thought it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.240 
though this isn't the color I thought it
was<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.840> mean<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.590> different<00:03:02.860> color<00:03:03.010> but

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250

but this is a large and it's really

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.620 
but this is a large and it's really
see-through<00:03:06.670> even<00:03:06.940> look<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.180> nude<00:03:07.390> bra
