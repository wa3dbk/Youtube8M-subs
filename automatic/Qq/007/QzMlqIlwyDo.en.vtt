00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.779
 hello everyone from certainly 19 and how 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.570
 you could see 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.210
 I also brought skyrim on btp to begin 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.500
 this skyrim adventure with the agenda 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.910
 of the companions 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.600
 this video will be a demonstration video 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.429
 as always with medium- low difficulties 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.070
 in short, to be a video 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.410
 finally demonstrative however is a 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.649
 difference I will no longer be talking about the hours 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.269
 and get bored or ended up saying the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.179
 classic crap that I always do 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.899
 the rest is the rest of the videos 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.920
 short and therefore good 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.170
 vision 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.199
 and I hope that in this video you can 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.260
 be helpful as mentioned do not do them 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.140
 for the whole video but only in the case 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.090
 there is some element in particular 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 good vision 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 let me take care of it 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.109
 a person now 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.740
 and perhaps I see a certain strength of spirit 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.770
 master you are not really thinking of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.659
 accept it I am not the master of 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.299
 no one there the cas 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.189

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.030
 in the heart 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 I apologize but maybe it is not yet the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.860
 moment I know nothing about this 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.679
 stranger sometimes they come to us 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.350
 important people, other men and women 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.310
 they come to us to seek their fame 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 it makes no difference what matters is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.280
 their heart is their arm 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.880
