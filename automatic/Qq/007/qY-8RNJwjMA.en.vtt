00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
sorry for my English but I think the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.970 
sorry for my English but I think the
most<00:02:52.659> important<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:53.469> you<00:02:53.799> can

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
most important is that you can

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.839 
most important is that you can
understand<00:02:54.489> though

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
understand though

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.259 
understand though
so<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.419> original<00:02:55.769> HDD<00:02:56.769> must<00:02:57.069> always<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:58.150> be

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
so the original HDD must always to be

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.140 
so the original HDD must always to be
connected<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.560> place<00:02:59.859> here<00:03:00.099> source<00:03:00.669> okay

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
and like you can see you can also

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.220 
and like you can see you can also
connect<00:03:03.370> bigger<00:03:04.109> HDDs

it will come here first light the second
a<00:04:02.500> certain<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.009> fault<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.639> they<00:04:04.239> are<00:04:04.419> moving

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
a certain the fault and they are moving

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.979 
a certain the fault and they are moving
here<00:04:05.229> like<00:04:05.829> night<00:04:06.219> release<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.849> know<00:04:07.060> just

here like night release a you know just
like<00:04:08.259> it's<00:04:08.709> reflash<00:04:09.219> and<00:04:09.719> when<00:04:10.719> all<00:04:10.959> these

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
like it's reflash and when all these

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.059 
like it's reflash and when all these
LEDs<00:04:11.590> are<00:04:11.819> we<00:04:12.819> can<00:04:12.969> say<00:04:13.120> on<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.620> means<00:04:14.889> the
