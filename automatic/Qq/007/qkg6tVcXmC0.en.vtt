go straight in with just two tablespoons

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.790 
go straight in with just two tablespoons
of<00:04:25.100> crème<00:04:25.639> fraiche<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.990> could<00:04:27.229> use<00:04:27.410> single

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
of crème fraiche you could use single

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.770

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
and then we're going to use some lemon

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.390 
and then we're going to use some lemon
juice<00:04:32.720> now<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:33.470> you've<00:04:33.620> got<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.770> fine<00:04:34.070> grater

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
juice now if you've got a fine grater

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400 
juice now if you've got a fine grater
you<00:04:34.820> could<00:04:35.449> use<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.690> little<00:04:35.990> bit<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.169> lemon<00:04:36.259> zest

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
you could use a little bit of lemon zest

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.860 
you could use a little bit of lemon zest
because<00:04:37.039> there's<00:04:37.250> great<00:04:37.550> flavor<00:04:37.910> from<00:04:38.720> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
because there's great flavor from the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.990 
because there's great flavor from the
zest<00:04:39.080> right<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.250> there's<00:04:40.490> no<00:04:40.580> point<00:04:40.820> in

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
zest right and there's no point in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.320 
zest right and there's no point in
wasting<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.509> but<00:04:42.580> most<00:04:43.580> importantly<00:04:44.000> use<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
wasting it but most importantly use the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.640 
wasting it but most importantly use the
juice<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.740> I'm<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:45.949> gonna<00:04:46.099> cut<00:04:46.699> that<00:04:46.820> in<00:04:46.910> half
