this<00:00:00.780> space<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.230> all<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:01.800> aging<00:00:02.250> in<00:00:02.370> place

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
this space is all about aging in place

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:10.459 
this space is all about aging in place
but<00:00:03.240> it<00:00:03.389> doesn't<00:00:03.780> look<00:00:03.990> it<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:09.349> wanted<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
but it doesn't look it I wanted the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.610 
but it doesn't look it I wanted the
kitchen<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.099> be<00:00:11.219> totally<00:00:11.730> functional<00:00:12.620> there's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
kitchen to be totally functional there's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.369 
kitchen to be totally functional there's
wide<00:00:14.160> traffic<00:00:14.849> patterns<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.839> wheelchair

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
wide traffic patterns for wheelchair

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
wide traffic patterns for wheelchair
accessibility<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.460> becomes<00:00:17.789> an<00:00:18.029> issue<00:00:18.210> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
accessibility if that becomes an issue I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.200 
accessibility if that becomes an issue I
use<00:00:19.500> different<00:00:19.859> color<00:00:20.130> countertops<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
use different color countertops in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
use different color countertops in
different<00:00:21.750> function<00:00:22.260> areas<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.279> also

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
different function areas and I also

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
different function areas and I also
varied<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> heights<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.930> those<00:00:25.230> countertops

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
varied the heights of those countertops

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
varied the heights of those countertops
for<00:00:26.340> convenience<00:00:26.849> based<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
for convenience based on what the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.919 
for convenience based on what the
function<00:00:28.050> might<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> sink<00:00:29.849> area<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
function might be so the sink area is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.620 
function might be so the sink area is
just<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.349> tad<00:00:31.590> lower<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.640> cooking<00:00:33.090> area<00:00:33.270> comes

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
just a tad lower the cooking area comes

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510 
just a tad lower the cooking area comes
up<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.899> little<00:00:34.079> bit<00:00:34.230> more<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> area

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
up a little bit more and then the area

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
up a little bit more and then the area
where<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> microwave<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.420> oven<00:00:36.510> are<00:00:36.989> raised

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
where the microwave and oven are raised

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
where the microwave and oven are raised
up<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.680> even<00:00:38.040> higher<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.750> from

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
up is even higher but they all go from

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.680 
up is even higher but they all go from
white<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.500> suit<00:00:40.920> white<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.300> visual

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
white to suit white it's a visual

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
white to suit white it's a visual
separation<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> delineates<00:00:44.219> work<00:00:44.879> areas

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
separation that delineates work areas

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
separation that delineates work areas
basically<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:47.730> did<00:00:48.000> define<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> small

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
basically we did define a small

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
basically we did define a small
Peninsula<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.649> basically<00:00:49.920> has<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> rolling

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
Peninsula that basically has a rolling

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
Peninsula that basically has a rolling
cabinet<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> fits<00:00:52.170> underneath<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
cabinet that fits underneath the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
cabinet that fits underneath the
countertop<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.940> idea<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> future<00:00:55.020> if

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
countertop the idea was in the future if

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
countertop the idea was in the future if
you<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> build<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.890> accessibility<00:00:56.610> or

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
you need to build your accessibility or

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.189 
you need to build your accessibility or
you<00:00:57.000> were<00:00:57.180> older<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> couldn't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you were older and you just couldn't

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
you were older and you just couldn't
stand<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.800> long<00:00:58.949> periods<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> time<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.000> could

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
stand for long periods of time you could

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
stand for long periods of time you could
remove<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.260> rolling<00:01:01.739> cabinet<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
remove that rolling cabinet and you have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
remove that rolling cabinet and you have
room<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.030> chair<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.600> wheelchair<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.229> sit

down and work at that area we have a pot
filler<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.360> help<00:01:09.600> eliminate<00:01:09.950> carrying<00:01:10.950> heavy

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
filler to help eliminate carrying heavy

definitely a dining room where they can
entertain<00:03:06.270> friends<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.450> works<00:03:09.600> for<00:03:09.810> them
