00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
hall level I have been working on these
walls<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> reason<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.090> found

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
walls and the reason for that is I found

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.020 
walls and the reason for that is I found
that<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:58.350> alt<00:01:58.649> account<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.369> you're<00:01:59.729> just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that with alt account if you're just

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.569 
that with alt account if you're just
going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> rely<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.570> collect<00:02:01.049> herbs<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.829> it's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
going to rely on collect herbs then it's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to rely on collect herbs then it's
really<00:02:02.939> hard<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> hold<00:02:03.540> more<00:02:03.899> than<00:02:04.250> 33<00:02:05.250> million

so<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.930> eventually<00:02:14.650> once<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
so I'm going to eventually once the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.830 
so I'm going to eventually once the
I<00:02:15.340> finish<00:02:15.820> up<00:02:15.940> these<00:02:16.120> walls<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.630> I've<00:02:16.780> been

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
I finish up these walls and I've been

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.900 
I finish up these walls and I've been
doing<00:02:17.080> two<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.230> three<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> day<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:18.580> from<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
doing two or three a day just from the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.100 
doing two or three a day just from the
gold<00:02:19.120> I've<00:02:19.300> been<00:02:19.510> collecting<00:02:19.660> off<00:02:19.990> my

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
gold I've been collecting off my

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.650 
gold I've been collecting off my
collectors<00:02:20.620> once<00:02:21.550> these<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> level<00:02:22.270> 6

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
collectors once these all get to level 6

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.030 
collectors once these all get to level 6
i'm<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.020> switch<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:23.440> into<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> town

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
i'm going to switch this into a town

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.490 
i'm going to switch this into a town
hall<00:02:24.190> 9<00:02:24.220> salad<00:02:24.880> defense<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:26.290> more

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
hall 9 salad defense and get more

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.840 
hall 9 salad defense and get more
storage<00:02:26.950> collectors<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.580> i<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:27.760> it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
storage collectors and i think it's

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.600 
storage collectors and i think it's
going<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.030> make<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.300> lot<00:02:28.450> easier<00:02:28.480> for<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
going to make it a lot easier for me to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.310 
going to make it a lot easier for me to
you<00:02:30.610> hold<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.270> resources<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> little<00:02:32.200> bit

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
you hold on to my resources a little bit

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.050 
you hold on to my resources a little bit
better<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.740> get<00:02:32.890> more<00:02:33.100> people<00:02:33.400> sniping<00:02:33.940> my

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
better and get more people sniping my

have 800 donations this time I haven't
attacked<00:02:44.020> at<00:02:44.230> all<00:02:44.380> I'm<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.430> progressing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
attacked at all I'm just progressing

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.250 
attacked at all I'm just progressing
along<00:02:46.030> steadily<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:46.720> actually<00:02:46.990> think<00:02:47.170> this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
along steadily so actually think this

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.100 
along steadily so actually think this
experiments<00:02:47.950> working<00:02:48.280> out<00:02:48.660> I've<00:02:49.660> been<00:02:49.720> giving

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
experiments working out I've been giving

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.420 
experiments working out I've been giving
a<00:02:50.170> lot<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.350> dragons<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.920> myself<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
a lot of dragons to myself and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430 
a lot of dragons to myself and
eventually<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.000> will<00:02:52.090> change<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> other<00:02:52.990> units

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
eventually it will change to other units

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.590 
eventually it will change to other units
I<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:54.550> need<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:54.910> five-star

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
I really need to get this five-star

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.810 
I really need to get this five-star
wizard<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> can<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.740> know<00:02:56.800> pass<00:02:57.400> out<00:02:57.640> good

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
wizard so I can you know pass out good

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.460 
wizard so I can you know pass out good
wizards<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.360> myself<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:58.960> clan<00:02:59.230> don't

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
wizards to myself and my clan don't

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.650 
wizards to myself and my clan don't
think<00:02:59.650> they'll<00:02:59.770> be<00:02:59.860> very<00:02:59.920> useful<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.610> well<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
think they'll be very useful as well so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.270 
think they'll be very useful as well so
she<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.960> my<00:03:02.110> main<00:03:02.350> base<00:03:02.590> gets<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.100> bit

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
she is my main base gets a little bit

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.120 
she is my main base gets a little bit
higher<00:03:03.460> level<00:03:04.560> you'll<00:03:05.560> also<00:03:05.770> eventually

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
higher level you'll also eventually

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.700 
higher level you'll also eventually
probably<00:03:06.550> get<00:03:06.820> balloons<00:03:07.180> max<00:03:07.840> out<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.530> be

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
probably get balloons max out and be

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.460 
probably get balloons max out and be
able<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.890> pass<00:03:09.100> those<00:03:09.340> over<00:03:09.610> as<00:03:09.790> well<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> just

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
able to pass those over as well so just

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.720 
able to pass those over as well so just
want<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.830> give<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.070> update<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.640> what
