a crime you get taxed for gold and
silver<00:01:08.790> exchanges<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.790> be

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
silver exchanges so this way it could be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
silver exchanges so this way it could be
a<00:01:11.939> gradual<00:01:12.360> transition<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
a gradual transition you don't have to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190 
a gradual transition you don't have to
close<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> Fed<00:01:14.220> down<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.790> day<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.600> if

close the Fed down in one day but if

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
close the Fed down in one day but if
people<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.619> nervous<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.159> hey<00:01:17.340> maybe<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.000> ought

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
people get nervous a hey maybe I ought

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.550 
people get nervous a hey maybe I ought
to<00:01:18.299> put<00:01:18.420> my<00:01:18.600> money<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> bank<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.380> says

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to put my money in the bank that says

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
to put my money in the bank that says
they're<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.159> they'll<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
