is<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:02.020> couple<00:02:02.649> flaws<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.039> are<00:02:03.490> extremely<00:02:04.329> big

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
is a couple flaws that are extremely big

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.960 
is a couple flaws that are extremely big
flaws<00:02:04.930> for<00:02:05.409> example<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.009> left<00:02:06.250> trigger<00:02:06.579> is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
flaws for example the left trigger is

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.080 
flaws for example the left trigger is
still<00:02:07.750> ultimately<00:02:08.019> choose<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.399> three-point

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
still ultimately choose the three-point

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.290 
still ultimately choose the three-point
shots<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.569> cheese<00:02:10.780> even<00:02:11.319> though<00:02:11.730> maybe<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
shots or cheese even though maybe it's a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.720 
shots or cheese even though maybe it's a
my<00:02:13.510> team<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.019> three-point<00:02:14.530> shot<00:02:14.830> thus

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
my team but the three-point shot thus

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.699 
my team but the three-point shot thus
far<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.060> I've<00:02:16.330> been<00:02:16.510> playing<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
far that I've been playing with is a

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.790 
far that I've been playing with is a
little<00:02:18.160> bit<00:02:18.310> too<00:02:18.580> high<00:02:19.260> another<00:02:20.260> thing<00:02:20.590> is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
little bit too high another thing is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.770 
little bit too high another thing is
that<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.340> seems<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.760> players<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:22.630> like

that it seems like players that are like

that it seems like players that are like
big<00:02:23.080> men<00:02:23.260> are<00:02:23.440> able<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.830> stick<00:02:24.160> point<00:02:24.670> guards

and shooting guards which should be very
