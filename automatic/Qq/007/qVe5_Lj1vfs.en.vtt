00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone with you crashes and today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.540
 I would like to tell you how to improve 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
 the quality of your microphone is mine 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.759
 microphone bought somewhere for 200 or for 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 250 rubles is shorter and very cheap 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.010
 it is clear that with this cheap quality 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 the microphone will be very cool and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.640
 because today I will tell you how 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 improve the quality of the microphone even if you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 bought a vase for 150 rubles 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 roughly speaking the biggest minus here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 Such a cheap microphone is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.239
 lack of show suppression because now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 I will show you how to remove noise and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 so first programs firewood want you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.870
 show are called audacity she 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 completely free and have just 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 huge huge functionality and now 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.840
 I will show you how to remove noise and with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 your audio track and so let's 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 write some sentence 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 I write this down to check how much 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.559
 huge noises in this track it was 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 strangely said well let's see 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.930
 here we see that here these noises 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.119
 clearly visible here is that they are huge 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.549
 the noise of it let's listen to the noise itself and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.740
 let's put it like that we have dried steel 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.750
 noise and you hear them perfectly like me and that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 you need to do to remove them 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.509
 We select exactly this part for which 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.229
 we see for ourselves the noise and now this 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.689
 touch push effects 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.579
 noise removal and push create model 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.439
 noise well i mean we create a model here 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.720
 such here 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.119
 gap noise so to speak create 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.990
 noise model we all created a model 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 click on the keyboard shortcut counter 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.860
 the whole entry is highlighted click effects and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 repeat noise removal here comes the process 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.000
 noise removal and how we see the waves 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.040
 gone let's listen to our recording I 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.939
 I write this down to check how much 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.630
 huge noises in this track and how we 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.739
 hear the noise and disappeared and the sound became much 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.380
 cleaner to normalize it will need 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.990
 also go to effects and our 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 same and find here the signal normalization 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.050
 we change nothing here just click 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.620
 ok all as we see our signal 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.970
 normalized and the sound became so will be even 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.250
 more or less 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 so at least real let's move on to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940
 next program 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
 so our next program is called 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.380
 fl studio is professional 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
 program that is used 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.340
 record companies 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.580
 Well, as far as I know, and now I will show you 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.230
 how to make your sound more studio like 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.630
 in studio microphones here let's 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.220
 let's hear what the sound is now I'm 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.880
 write down what to check as far as 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.569
 huge yes i stand the same sound 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.580
 who was still in that program and 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.650
 let me show you how to make a sound 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.290
 more studio go to settings 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.870
 that is, the effects effects here 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.440
 standard they suit us completely 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 We go here and here remove a dream where 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.900
 easier and 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.450
 on put here on the c button and 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.459
 set it up here it is like this 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.390
 so we set up and 2 choose now 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.510
 maximus and here we see this 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.030
 the line we put somewhere in the middle here 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.970
 here a little bit like this and let's 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.430
 let's hear how ours sounds now 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.100
 voice I write it down what to check 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.730
 so huge noise in this track 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.140
 we hear that the sound was transformed and became 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.920
 more studio and if you liked it 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.569
 this is something you can also do yourself 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.140
 so that everyone thinks that in a studio 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.850
 microphone 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.000
 well i don't do that since it's better on 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.040
 I collect money for a normal microphone Well 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.109
 if i think you can 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.269
 finish if you liked the video then 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.950

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.420
 comment 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:19.100
 and I also wanted to add in order 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.550
 you to record voice was without 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.270
 sounds that are very annoying 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.550
 make a pop filter by filtering me 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.320
 homemade so to speak if you want 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.910
