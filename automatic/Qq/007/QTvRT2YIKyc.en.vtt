backward both on the same trends you can
see<00:02:48.860> exactly<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.370> same<00:02:49.610> trends<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.420> both<00:02:50.989> of

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
see exactly the same trends and both of

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.630 
see exactly the same trends and both of
them<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.500> cargo<00:02:51.830> at<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.700> rear<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.190> let's<00:02:55.459> go

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
them as cargo at the rear so let's go

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.729 
them as cargo at the rear so let's go
ahead<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.849> see<00:02:56.500> here<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.739> see<00:02:58.660> wow<00:02:59.739> it
