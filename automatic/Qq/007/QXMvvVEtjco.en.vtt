post here was bolted to the concrete ok
and<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.900> existing<00:00:25.170> post

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and here I'm using an existing post

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
and here I'm using an existing post
which<00:00:25.859> was<00:00:25.980> probably<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> porch<00:00:26.789> overhang

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
which was probably the porch overhang

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750 
which was probably the porch overhang
but<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.199> post<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.650> painted<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> rest

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
but this post was painted like the rest

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.040 
but this post was painted like the rest
of<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.420> i<00:00:30.449> had<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> get<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> grinder

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of this was so i had to get the grinder

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
of this was so i had to get the grinder
with<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> sanding<00:00:31.800> disc<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> strip<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
with a sanding disc and strip all that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
with a sanding disc and strip all that
off<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.290> once<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> slamming<00:00:35.070> goes<00:00:35.190> on

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
off so because once the slamming goes on

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.770 
off so because once the slamming goes on
it<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.640> look<00:00:35.730> better<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.210> sustain<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it would look better if they sustain the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
it would look better if they sustain the
match<00:00:36.960> breslin<00:00:37.500> painted<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.040> stick<00:00:38.219> out

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
match breslin painted it was stick out

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
match breslin painted it was stick out
like<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.489> sore<00:00:38.610> thumb<00:00:38.850> yeah<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.170> i<00:00:40.290> lagged

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
like a sore thumb yeah and then i lagged

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
like a sore thumb yeah and then i lagged
into<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> house<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.940> established<00:00:42.750> level

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
into the house then established level

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
into the house then established level
all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.280> around<00:00:44.460> since<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
all the way around since this is a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.389 
all the way around since this is a
horizontal<00:00:45.539> fence<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.129> started

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
horizontal fence and then we started

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
horizontal fence and then we started
yelling<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> boards<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.629> long<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> you

yelling up the boards how long have you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
yelling up the boards how long have you
been<00:00:49.050> doing<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.860> Stefan<00:00:50.340> i<00:00:50.719> started<00:00:51.719> in

fences<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.280> gotten<00:01:17.580> more<00:01:17.820> fancy<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
fences have gotten more fancy and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.469 
fences have gotten more fancy and
different<00:01:18.960> designs<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> come<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:21.360> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
different designs have come about for is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.990 
different designs have come about for is
how<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.110> horizontals<00:01:23.000> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
how do they do these horizontals you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
how do they do these horizontals you
know<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> figured<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.290> yeah<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
know but I figured it out yeah it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
know but I figured it out yeah it
provides<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
provides here and there it's like this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.130 
provides here and there it's like this
game<00:01:28.380> 3<00:01:28.650> did<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> come<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> idea

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
game 3 did you come up with that idea

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
game 3 did you come up with that idea
this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> next-generation<00:01:32.100> gate<00:01:32.790> frames

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this is a next-generation gate frames

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
this is a next-generation gate frames
designed<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.840> prevent<00:01:34.110> sagging<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> came

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
designed to prevent sagging that I came

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.060 
designed to prevent sagging that I came
up<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> symmetrical<00:01:37.110> diagonally
