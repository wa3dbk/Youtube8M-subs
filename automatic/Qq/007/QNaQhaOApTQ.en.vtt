00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
underneath first section that we didn't

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.440 
underneath first section that we didn't
tease<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:02.930> make<00:03:03.110> sure<00:03:03.140> those<00:03:03.560> are<00:03:03.769> smooth<00:03:04.099> and

I<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.750> try<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.140> think<00:03:06.260> about<00:03:06.530> forming<00:03:06.950> a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
I really try and think about forming a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
I really try and think about forming a
cone<00:03:07.459> shape<00:03:07.760> here<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:09.230> base<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.799> triangle

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
cone shape here the base of the triangle

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280 
cone shape here the base of the triangle
is<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.640> widest<00:03:11.090> part<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> cone<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:12.140> then

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
is the widest part of the cone and then

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.800 
is the widest part of the cone and then
the<00:03:12.739> tips<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.549> hair<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.030> ends<00:03:14.540> are<00:03:14.660> all

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
the tips of the hair that ends are all

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.629 
the tips of the hair that ends are all
going<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.049> work<00:03:15.290> together<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.889> form<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.280> point

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
going to work together and form a point

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.449 
going to work together and form a point
the<00:03:17.329> point<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> cone<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.920> shape<00:03:19.280> is

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
the point of the cone and that shape is

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.550 
the point of the cone and that shape is
going<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.700> give<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.090> best<00:03:20.299> success<00:03:20.810> so
