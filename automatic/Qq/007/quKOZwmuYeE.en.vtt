00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.140
 Speak , people come to another video. 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.640
 that they maybe I always wanted to do a 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.410
 video actually I always thought of 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 make a first video review of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.210
 talk about bad and good things 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.320
 however I had not used it by 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.499
 long time 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.609
 and I listed here some good things and 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.079
 some bad things first is me 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.300
 listening to music or I put with 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.429
 the first sound high and high quality 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.829
 Oh you can hear the sound is very loud. 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.779
 even compared to any notebook sound 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.779
 it is a higher than there are 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.299
 so this is a quality 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.019
 the way he finishes it so much 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.640
 pretty 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.960
 now I can show the screen but it is 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.939
 very beautiful indeed 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.299
 I have it in gray color it has two 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.680
 stickers here then I would 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.479
 x-ray ex 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.950
 I do not know why there are so many people 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.600
 think I 'm fake that I'm recording 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.890
 my old computer but I do not have 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 but my old notebook computer is going 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 Even his good marcela is not top but she 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.360
 not to be missed 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.880
 his webcam is 720p even had never 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.580
 Used was good 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.310
 He's a long way from the top. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.520
 because I have my boss and mine 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.520
 stepfather has another sti notebook and is the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 sign of him gets better but far away 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.310
 even several usb walls 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.140
 he has 31 sb on the left side and one 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.200
 right side the most on the left side 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.969
 I put the robbery he's also drums. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.119
 a battery that lasts quite a lot 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:04.270
 His is not too heavy and he asks. 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:06.189
 very good is not top blue type but he is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 good does not leave anything to be desired 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.739
 time will not spend seems not 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.829
 will spend and the bad things 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.660
 bad is what it only has one entry p2 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:23.560
 Do you connect the microphone or headset? 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.500
 normal or you for example the headset 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.049
 microphone ear in notebook or triple 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.239
 microphone and uses the sound of the notebook is a 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.510
 Goodbye phone that I have that I 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.980
 I had already retired and two others who 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.709
 I always wore it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.370
 and I was something that has this need 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.160
 possible book is the video card is so 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.659
 complicated as it is to 88 50 and has a lot of 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.650
 people with problems can not use 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:56.040
 first important thing is for games 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.470
 I'm using the 13.11 driver now 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.599
 search you think it the mobile mobi 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.540
 is to download to the computer is moby because 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.549
 your notebook from you install it is the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.079
 best of brazil for games he gives it 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.239
 It's not giving a white screen. 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.319
 it opens any games they always knew 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 sing asia 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.760
 like this notebook you will not 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.090
 get to use photoshop sony vegas 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.269
 it 's not rendering fast you're just going 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.120
 able to use his processor because 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.519
 it does not recognize the normal computer 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.590
 which only uses good video card it uses the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.010
 another, for example, here at the mark on my 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.769
 the desktop he is now using 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:41.439
 the video card of the processor and only 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.629
 some games can run on the 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.250
 the video card but most by 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.989
 sky example 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.290
 those games that have the same before 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.620
 play types fall and hit corsa ring of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.290
 food for example is 18 thousand those are well 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.049
 The hard drive of the video card to run is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.359
 type corsa hit and it gets the black screen 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.519
 more if you move the mouse it goes 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.359
 give the noise that the boy is alive 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.819
 It's on, it's very slow. 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.199
 it is very slow to load is more 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.349
 windows notebook is very fast 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:16.359
 even with hd is and also has a bottleneck 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.370
 I do not understand this 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:24.639
 imagine you go the dell engineers 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.320
 let's make a notebook and such and such 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.680
 it was on a weak processor and a 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.229
 strong video card 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.139
 she has in her head I think any 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.789
 idiot who sends some computer 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.110
 You know it here in the throat 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.729
 I bought because I do not have much. 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.740
 Money, I knew it was a cat. 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.380
 this processor is very weak is the 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.349
 level of a core 2 quad being even 15 and 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.880
 even the 7 he has some core 2 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.090
 I still had a face I had a 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.539
 core 2 quad old these five here 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:04.029
 is compared to 1 and 3 2 thousand and 100 and a 77 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:07.070
 57 51 77 70 m is he has a keyboard 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:13.010
 numeric keyboard 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:16.250
 Fixed f1 here has nothing more to talk about 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.720
 very good notebook is a better cost 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.120
 benefit but if you will use 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.230
 photoshop get one with video card from 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.940
 nvidia 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.160
 Why does this happen with this drive? 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.790
 Attorney date and why nvidia to 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.440
 You force that shit out of the graph. 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.440
 computing system that works in almost 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.320
 game then I hope you have 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.870
 overheating and reaches 90 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.040
 degrees playing it heats up a lot more 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.930
 not wide 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.720
 even playing high in europe can 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.970
 play fucking here at home in which the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.460
 I 'm just afraid I'm afraid. 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.140
 I think it 's the kiss to you, you do not know the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.740
 which is since overheating of the 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.130
 chipset of the motherboard of a notebook is 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.130
 a problem that happens a lot because 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.810
 he sink has a sink if the 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.800
 the chipset does not pass through the 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.540
 chipset gets too hot and will drop 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.310
 So you have to answer him or 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.800
 change the chip 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.700
 This is a bit complicated and not always 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:23.480
 have a solution and I also have the 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:25.190
 The problem with the screen here is everyone 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.560
 watching this is a problem I think 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.560
 hard to happen is not every notebook 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.600
 that has a manufacturing problem if 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.700
 starting the screen does not work there anymore 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.940
 I'll think of a call from the technician to 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.370
 change is is dell has a support that 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.760
 them if you send a video a photo of the 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.150
 Your problem in one day will show the 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:53.470
 technician to put this part in your 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.470
 Sound notebook is very high 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.330
 I hope you enjoyed talking about 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:06.460
 lyric and until next time 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.460
 comment I always answer're told
