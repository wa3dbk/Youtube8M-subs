sides and then you've got a small clip

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.449 
sides and then you've got a small clip
on<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> bottom<00:02:13.590> which<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.860> called<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.130> slick

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
on the bottom which is called a slick

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.040 
on the bottom which is called a slick
clip<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
clip and what this is this is a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.810 
clip and what this is this is a
stabilization<00:02:16.680> clip<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.640> non

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
stabilization clip it's a non

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 
stabilization clip it's a non
load-bearing<00:02:18.150> clip<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.860> does<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
load-bearing clip so what it does is it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.560 
load-bearing clip so what it does is it
keeps<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> bottom<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> pack<00:02:21.270> from

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
keeps the bottom of the pack from

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.210 
keeps the bottom of the pack from
flapping<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.350> down<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.709> rotating

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
flapping up and down or rotating

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.980 
flapping up and down or rotating
side-to-side

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
side-to-side

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.150 
side-to-side
once<00:02:24.990> you're<00:02:25.170> secured<00:02:25.590> onto<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.980> vest<00:02:28.160> this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
is an example of what it looks like when

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.760 
is an example of what it looks like when
it's<00:02:30.959> on<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> vest<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:32.160> as<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:33.770> strap
