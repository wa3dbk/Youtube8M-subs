mulching you know I don't generally
recommend<00:00:50.310> you<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.920> stones<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.430> rocks<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:54.120> a

mulch in your garden and the main
problem<00:00:56.400> with<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.970> that<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.480> let

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
problem with that is that they don't let

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.100 
problem with that is that they don't let
organic<00:00:58.710> matter<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.730> recycled<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.660> into<00:01:00.720> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
organic matter be recycled back into the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.260 
organic matter be recycled back into the
soil<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.130> one<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.610> most<00:01:02.760> important

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
soil which is one of the most important

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
soil which is one of the most important
goals<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.720> us<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.140> our<00:01:04.259> gardens<00:01:04.649> are<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> to

goals for us in our gardens are is to
improve<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> organic<00:01:06.030> matter<00:01:06.149> content<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
improve the organic matter content in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
improve the organic matter content in
the<00:01:06.869> soil<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> the

fall from the trees and the plants we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
fall from the trees and the plants we
want<00:01:12.840> them<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.170> incorporated<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.889> into

every year a couple of years and things
like<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.579> so<00:01:21.109> stones<00:01:22.109> stop<00:01:22.649> all<00:01:22.859> of<00:01:22.889> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like that so stones stop all of this

like that so stones stop all of this
process<00:01:23.819> from<00:01:23.969> happening<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.719> just

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
process from happening and they just

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.749 
process from happening and they just
they<00:01:25.350> stopped<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> whole<00:01:25.859> nutrient<00:01:26.520> cycling

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
they stopped the whole nutrient cycling

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.690 
they stopped the whole nutrient cycling
and<00:01:27.289> organic<00:01:28.289> matter<00:01:28.499> replenishment<00:01:29.369> process

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and organic matter replenishment process

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.719 
and organic matter replenishment process
in<00:01:29.819> the<00:01:29.909> soil<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.039> one<00:01:32.219> time<00:01:32.459> that<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
in the soil but there is one time that I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.269 
in the soil but there is one time that I
did<00:01:33.179> I<00:01:33.299> use<00:01:33.539> rocks<00:01:33.959> and<00:01:34.289> it's<00:01:34.770> called<00:01:35.009> rock

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:35.279 
did I use rocks and it's called rock

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.069 
did I use rocks and it's called rock
mulching<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.209> reason<00:01:36.569> which<00:01:36.719> to<00:01:36.959> me

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
mulching for some reason which to me

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.069 
mulching for some reason which to me
just<00:01:37.319> sounds<00:01:37.529> like<00:01:37.799> mulching<00:01:38.459> with<00:01:38.490> rocks<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
just sounds like mulching with rocks but

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.029 
just sounds like mulching with rocks but
it's<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.069> is<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.819> oh<00:01:43.039> that's

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
it's not what it is is it some oh that's

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's not what it is is it some oh that's
a<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.279> lie<00:01:44.459> lock<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:47.689> guess<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
a nice lie lock right there I guess it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.459 
a nice lie lock right there I guess it
doesn't<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.109> as<00:01:49.229> cool<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.590> camera<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:51.469> hadn't

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
doesn't look as cool on camera I hadn't

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.149 
doesn't look as cool on camera I hadn't
noticed<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> yet<00:01:54.649> sorry<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.979> distracted

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
noticed that yet sorry I got distracted

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
noticed that yet sorry I got distracted
so<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> rock<00:01:59.009> mulching<00:01:59.429> is<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.759> we<00:02:00.259> usually

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
so so rock mulching is when we usually

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.609 
so so rock mulching is when we usually
around<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.859> very<00:02:02.069> important<00:02:02.929> new<00:02:03.929> plant<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
around a very important new plant like a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.379 
around a very important new plant like a
young<00:02:04.919> fruit<00:02:05.399> tree<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:05.849> something<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> we

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
young fruit tree or something that we

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.080 
young fruit tree or something that we
have<00:02:06.599> you<00:02:07.319> make<00:02:08.190> sure<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
have you make sure you you know have a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.900 
have you make sure you you know have a
nice<00:02:09.300> bed<00:02:10.170> around<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.770> tree<00:02:11.009> put<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:11.880> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
nice bed around the tree put down a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
nice bed around the tree put down a
bunch<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> leaves<00:02:12.630> like<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> few<00:02:13.200> inches<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
bunch of leaves like a few inches of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.039 
bunch of leaves like a few inches of
leaves<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.250> bed<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:15.239> put<00:02:15.840> some

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
leaves in that bed and then put some

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.140 
leaves in that bed and then put some
rocks<00:02:16.319> on<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.129> little<00:02:17.519> rocks<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.000> like

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
rocks on top not little rocks but like

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150 
rocks on top not little rocks but like
bigger<00:02:18.390> rocks<00:02:18.720> or<00:02:19.019> flag<00:02:19.319> stones<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
bigger rocks or flag stones which I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.880 
bigger rocks or flag stones which I
done<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.810> I'll<00:02:22.170> hear<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.680> show<00:02:22.830> you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
done and I'll hear I can show you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.140 
done and I'll hear I can show you
because<00:02:23.070> I've<00:02:23.280> done<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> pear<00:02:23.970> tree<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
because I've done it to a pear tree here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.730 
because I've done it to a pear tree here
and<00:02:27.150> I'll<00:02:27.240> actually<00:02:27.420> show<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.410> because

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
and I'll actually show you that because

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.070 
and I'll actually show you that because
I<00:02:28.800> was<00:02:28.950> recording<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.550> yesterday<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I was recording this yesterday in a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.100 
I was recording this yesterday in a
video<00:02:31.320> for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.650> Academy<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> I'll<00:02:33.870> show<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
video for the Academy so I'll show you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.520 
video for the Academy so I'll show you
the<00:02:34.260> process<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:35.070> from<00:02:35.640> start<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.970> finish<00:02:36.000> so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the process of from start to finish so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.870 
the process of from start to finish so
what<00:02:37.530> happens<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.010> first<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.400> make<00:02:38.610> sure<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
what happens is first you make sure the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.700 
what happens is first you make sure the
bed<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.210> good<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.750> put<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.410> nice

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
bed is good and then you put this nice

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.530 
bed is good and then you put this nice
layer<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.070> leaves<00:02:41.460> in<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> few<00:02:41.970> inches<00:02:42.300> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
layer of leaves in there a few inches of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.660 
layer of leaves in there a few inches of
leaves<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.680> cover<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> up<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.220> rocks

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
leaves then you cover it up with rocks

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.140 
leaves then you cover it up with rocks
and<00:02:45.680> what<00:02:46.680> happens<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.250> normally<00:02:47.940> those

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and what happens is normally those

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.360 
and what happens is normally those
leaves<00:02:48.420> would<00:02:48.660> take<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.380> 6<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.010> 8<00:02:50.130> months

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
leaves would take you know 6 to 8 months

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.460 
leaves would take you know 6 to 8 months
to<00:02:50.670> break<00:02:50.820> down<00:02:51.060> something<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.960> but

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to break down something like that but

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.440 
to break down something like that but
with<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> rocks<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.910> happens<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
with the rocks on there it happens in a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.100 
with the rocks on there it happens in a
couple<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.870> months<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.600> means<00:02:57.870> is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
couple of months and what that means is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
couple of months and what that means is
that<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.440> add<00:02:58.890> another<00:02:59.220> few<00:02:59.640> inches<00:02:59.670> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
that I can add another few inches of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.630 
that I can add another few inches of
leaves<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> couple<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.950> months<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.460> can

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
leaves in a couple of months and I can

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.520 
leaves in a couple of months and I can
do<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> few<00:03:02.970> times<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.570> year<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.080> that's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
do that a few times this year and that's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.780 
do that a few times this year and that's
really<00:03:04.740> where<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> get<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.190> benefits<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.670> by

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
really where you get the benefits is by

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.190 
really where you get the benefits is by
doing<00:03:05.850> this<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> few<00:03:06.270> times<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> year<00:03:06.990> so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
doing this a few times in the year so

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.980 
doing this a few times in the year so
the<00:03:07.230> rocks<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.150> they're<00:03:09.480> it's

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the rocks really it's like they're it's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.240 
the rocks really it's like they're it's
like<00:03:10.050> they're<00:03:10.260> almost<00:03:10.380> making<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:10.980> these

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
like they're almost making this these

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.960 
like they're almost making this these
leaves<00:03:11.460> compost<00:03:12.030> much<00:03:12.300> more<00:03:12.540> quickly

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
leaves compost much more quickly

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.130 
leaves compost much more quickly
improving<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> organic<00:03:15.450> matter<00:03:15.630> content<00:03:15.870> of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
improving the organic matter content of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.370 
improving the organic matter content of
the<00:03:16.230> soil<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.620> people<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.250> proposed

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
the soil and people have proposed

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.810 
the soil and people have proposed
different<00:03:19.380> reasons<00:03:19.710> why<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> rocks<00:03:20.400> might<00:03:20.640> do

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
different reasons why the rocks might do

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.020 
different reasons why the rocks might do
that<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.240> know<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.510> could<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:23.030> just

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
that you know it could be that that just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.750 
that you know it could be that that just
the<00:03:24.660> pressure<00:03:24.900> exerted<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.100> leaves<00:03:26.340> is

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the pressure exerted on the leaves is

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.120 
the pressure exerted on the leaves is
gets<00:03:27.420> them<00:03:27.630> more<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.990> contact<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.920> soil

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
gets them more in contact with the soil

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.830 
gets them more in contact with the soil
food<00:03:29.370> web<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:29.970> earthworms<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.600> allows

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
food web and with earthworms and allows

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.930 
food web and with earthworms and allows
them<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.080> break<00:03:31.350> down<00:03:31.560> faster<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.610> could<00:03:32.820> be

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
them to break down faster it could be

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.430 
them to break down faster it could be
that<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.209> rocks<00:03:33.390> offer<00:03:33.660> protection<00:03:34.290> for

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that the rocks offer protection for

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.690 
that the rocks offer protection for
earthworms<00:03:34.770> because<00:03:35.100> there's<00:03:35.250> certainly<00:03:35.550> an

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
earthworms because there's certainly an

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.340 
earthworms because there's certainly an
explosion<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.270> earthworms<00:03:36.630> under<00:03:36.930> there<00:03:37.050> once

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
explosion of earthworms under there once

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.080 
explosion of earthworms under there once
these<00:03:37.500> rocks<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.130> there<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.880> could<00:03:39.060> be

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
these rocks get on there it could be

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.240 
these rocks get on there it could be
that<00:03:39.270> they<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.470> heat<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that they you know the heat that the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.030 
that they you know the heat that the
rocks<00:03:41.660> get<00:03:42.660> during<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.140> day<00:03:43.260> from<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.620> Sun<00:03:43.830> is

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
rocks get during the day from the Sun is

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.100 
rocks get during the day from the Sun is
radiated<00:03:44.730> back<00:03:44.850> out<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.240> night<00:03:45.450> allowing<00:03:45.930> for

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
radiated back out at night allowing for

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.390 
radiated back out at night allowing for
more<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.410> smooth<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:48.140> longer<00:03:49.140> break<00:03:49.770> down<00:03:50.010> by

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
more of a smooth a longer break down by

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.430 
more of a smooth a longer break down by
the<00:03:50.459> soil<00:03:50.790> food<00:03:50.970> web<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.480> just<00:03:51.840> more<00:03:52.020> heat<00:03:52.290> in

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
the soil food web and just more heat in

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.960 
the soil food web and just more heat in
there<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.860> there's<00:03:53.070> there's<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> longer<00:03:53.640> work

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
there so there's there's a longer work

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.510 
there so there's there's a longer work
day<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.209> them<00:03:55.100> could<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.340> there's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
day for them could be that there's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.740 
day for them could be that there's
there's<00:03:56.940> definitely<00:03:57.300> gonna<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.480> more

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
there's definitely gonna be more

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.420 
there's definitely gonna be more
moisture<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.440> there<00:03:58.620> with<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> rocks<00:03:59.160> there

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
moisture in there with the rocks there

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.520 
moisture in there with the rocks there
to<00:03:59.550> hold<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> moisture<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:01.230> probably

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
to hold the moisture in so it's probably

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.900 
to hold the moisture in so it's probably
all<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.770> these<00:04:01.890> reasons<00:04:02.070> together<00:04:02.550> I'm<00:04:02.730> not

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
all of these reasons together I'm not

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.820 
all of these reasons together I'm not
sure<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.540> do<00:04:03.900> know<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.170> these<00:04:04.440> leaves<00:04:04.709> are

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
sure but I do know that these leaves are

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.550 
sure but I do know that these leaves are
gonna<00:04:04.920> disappear<00:04:05.400> very<00:04:05.670> quickly<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.560> what's

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
gonna disappear very quickly and what's

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.690 
gonna disappear very quickly and what's
going<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.739> happen<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.130> by<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.310> end<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.610> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
going to happen is by the end of this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.250 
going to happen is by the end of this
year<00:04:08.940> when<00:04:09.120> I've<00:04:09.209> done<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.510> few<00:04:09.720> times<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
year when I've done this a few times the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.870 
year when I've done this a few times the
soil<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.920> be<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.250> beautiful<00:04:11.760> under

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
soil is going to be so beautiful under
