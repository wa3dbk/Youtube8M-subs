toying<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.899> idea<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.259> using<00:01:49.619> drones<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
toying with the idea of using drones to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
toying with the idea of using drones to
prevent<00:01:50.640> domestic<00:01:50.970> terrorist<00:01:51.689> attacks<00:01:52.020> and

prevent domestic terrorist attacks and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980 
prevent domestic terrorist attacks and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
using them within US airspace however

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
using them within US airspace however
and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.070> doubt<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.759> become

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and I really doubt that one will become

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.999 
and I really doubt that one will become
a<00:01:57.030> reality<00:01:57.090> most<00:01:57.869> Americans<00:01:58.409> probably<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
a reality most Americans probably have

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
a reality most Americans probably have
no<00:01:59.219> problem<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> drones<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
no problem with the use of drones in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
no problem with the use of drones in
other<00:02:00.719> countries<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.320> somehow<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.130> doubt<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
other countries but somehow I doubt that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.160 
other countries but somehow I doubt that
they're<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.540> okay<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:03.899> those

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
they're going to be okay with those

successor will share his views on the
use<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.290> drones<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> guess<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.430> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
use of drones so I guess that this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.700 
use of drones so I guess that this
latest<00:02:27.030> move<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.990> more<00:02:28.140> proof<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
latest move is just more proof that the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.280 
latest move is just more proof that the
era<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.190> drones<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.390> stay<00:02:30.630> whether

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
era of drones is here to stay whether

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.740 
era of drones is here to stay whether
they're<00:02:31.530> weaponized<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.550> get<00:02:33.360> used<00:02:33.600> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
they're weaponized or not get used to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.370
