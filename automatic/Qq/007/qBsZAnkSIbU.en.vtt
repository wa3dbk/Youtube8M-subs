00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
done that for gun material and you can

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
done that for gun material and you can
find<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.629> name<00:00:39.989> yours<00:00:40.230> by<00:00:40.469> going

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
find that are you name yours by going

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
find that are you name yours by going
into<00:00:40.890> your<00:00:41.390> materials<00:00:42.390> under<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> material

into your materials under the material
you<00:00:43.680> name<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> now<00:00:46.680> whenever<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.090> gets

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you name it so now whenever this gets

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
you name it so now whenever this gets
