00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
happen in all my other previous videos
that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.629> telling<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.140> about<00:00:40.290> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that I was telling you all about this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
that I was telling you all about this
time<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.399> stick<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.940> fun<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
time I stick out fun don't one of the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
time I stick out fun don't one of the
buggers<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.579> become

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
buggers in the back so it can become

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
buggers in the back so it can become
shorter<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.200> clip<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> ends

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
shorter and then my time clip the ends

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
shorter and then my time clip the ends
pretty<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.719> lot<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.260> end<00:00:49.530> off

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
pretty much that's a lot of my end off

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
pretty much that's a lot of my end off
so<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.579> appear<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.180> shorter<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
so it can appear a bit shorter because I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
so it can appear a bit shorter because I
was<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:52.680> wondering<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.160> wanting<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
was now I'm wondering it wanting it to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
was now I'm wondering it wanting it to
be<00:00:54.180> shorter<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.110> still<00:00:55.680> watch<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
be shorter and still watch it
