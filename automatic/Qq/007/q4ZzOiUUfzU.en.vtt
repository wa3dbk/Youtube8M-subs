answer to this is it completely depends
on<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.709> keyword<00:02:18.190> you're<00:02:18.459> trying<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.970> rank<00:02:19.180> for

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
on the keyword you're trying to rank for

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.630 
on the keyword you're trying to rank for
as<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.379> imagine<00:02:20.470> there's<00:02:21.129> probably<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
as you can imagine there's probably a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.720 
as you can imagine there's probably a
lot<00:02:22.150> less<00:02:22.450> competition<00:02:23.080> for<00:02:23.440> some<00:02:24.220> keywords

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
lot less competition for some keywords

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.140 
lot less competition for some keywords
than<00:02:25.300> others<00:02:25.660> for<00:02:25.930> example<00:02:26.739> if<00:02:27.280> you're<00:02:27.849> trying

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
than others for example if you're trying

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.599 
than others for example if you're trying
to<00:02:28.209> rank<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:29.019> best<00:02:29.530> dog<00:02:29.859> trainers<00:02:30.400> in

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
to rank for the best dog trainers in

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.530 
to rank for the best dog trainers in
Santa<00:02:30.969> Cruz

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540

probably

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
probably

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
probably
a<00:02:32.560> whole<00:02:32.890> lot<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.220> competition<00:02:33.370> there<00:02:34.150> when

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
a whole lot of competition there when

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.870 
a whole lot of competition there when
we're<00:02:34.840> talking<00:02:35.050> about<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.560> Internet<00:02:36.010> there

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
we're talking about the Internet there

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.520 
we're talking about the Internet there
might<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.270> bunch<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.660> people<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.230> town

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
might be a bunch of people in the town

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.710 
might be a bunch of people in the town
doing<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.610> they<00:02:39.850> might<00:02:40.120> not<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:40.360> an

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
doing it but they might not have an

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.990 
doing it but they might not have an
overly<00:02:41.200> optimized<00:02:41.709> website<00:02:42.340> they<00:02:42.700> probably

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
overly optimized website they probably

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.809 
overly optimized website they probably
couldn't<00:02:43.510> afford<00:02:43.600> anybody<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.830> SEO<00:02:45.310> for

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
couldn't afford anybody to do SEO for

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.390 
couldn't afford anybody to do SEO for
them<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.630> that's<00:02:46.990> probably<00:02:47.380> not<00:02:47.800> going<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.190> be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
them so that's probably not going to be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.229 
them so that's probably not going to be
a<00:02:48.430> lot<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:48.970> competition<00:02:49.350> around<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.500> keyword

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
a lot of competition around a keyword

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.120 
a lot of competition around a keyword
however<00:02:52.239> something<00:02:52.630> like<00:02:52.989> New<00:02:53.590> York<00:02:53.920> real

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
however something like New York real

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.449 
however something like New York real
estate<00:02:54.580> or<00:02:54.850> Los<00:02:55.510> Angeles<00:02:56.170> real<00:02:56.380> estate<00:02:56.459> things

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
estate or Los Angeles real estate things

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
estate or Los Angeles real estate things
like<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.000> are<00:02:58.270> going<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.600> be<00:02:58.750> heavily

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
like that are going to be heavily

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.559 
like that are going to be heavily
competitive<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.700> not<00:03:00.970> necessarily

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
competitive so it's not necessarily

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.690 
competitive so it's not necessarily
about<00:03:01.840> how<00:03:02.140> many<00:03:02.319> links<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.860> need<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.400> all

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
about how many links you need it all

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.699 
about how many links you need it all
starts<00:03:04.090> with<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.330> keyword<00:03:04.570> you're<00:03:05.230> trying<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
starts with the keyword you're trying to

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.280 
starts with the keyword you're trying to
rank<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.239> now<00:03:07.239> another<00:03:07.690> thing<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.260> think

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
rank for now another thing to think

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.860 
rank for now another thing to think
about<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:09.430> not<00:03:09.790> just<00:03:10.209> about<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.570> number

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
about is it's not just about the number

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.229 
about is it's not just about the number
of<00:03:11.019> links<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:11.950> about<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.340> quality<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:12.970> links

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
of links it's about the quality of links

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.840 
of links it's about the quality of links
so<00:03:14.019> in<00:03:14.200> some<00:03:14.530> ways<00:03:14.739> while<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> good

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
so in some ways while this is a good

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.550 
so in some ways while this is a good
question<00:03:16.060> saying<00:03:16.630> well<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.900> need<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.350> build

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
question saying well I need to build

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.550 
question saying well I need to build
links<00:03:17.769> how<00:03:18.250> many<00:03:18.489> do<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.730> build<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:20.230> not<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
links how many do I build it's not the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.979 
links how many do I build it's not the
only<00:03:20.980> answer<00:03:21.300> sometimes<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.510> need<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.720> think

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
only answer sometimes you need to think

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.199 
only answer sometimes you need to think
about<00:03:23.110> what<00:03:23.500> quality<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.160> links<00:03:24.550> do<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.790> need<00:03:25.060> to

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
about what quality of links do I need to

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.690 
about what quality of links do I need to
build<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.690> how<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.950> build<00:03:27.250> high<00:03:27.640> quality

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
build and how can I build high quality

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.960 
build and how can I build high quality
links<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.380> cover<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.160> depth<00:03:30.730> in

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
links and we cover that in depth in

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.540 
links and we cover that in depth in
another<00:03:31.390> video<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.739> next<00:03:32.950> question<00:03:33.400> is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
another video so the next question is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.740 
another video so the next question is

different types of links you can go and

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.120

acquire<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.330> your<00:04:22.570> site<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.050> how<00:04:23.650> they<00:04:23.830> differ

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
and how you can start thinking about
