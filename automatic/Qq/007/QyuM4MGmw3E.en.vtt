have a pretty good work too so I'm not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
have a pretty good work too so I'm not
too<00:01:54.689> worried<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> only<00:01:55.920> thing

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009

that<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.340> I'm<00:01:57.060> gonna<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.540> frustrated<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that I I'm gonna be frustrated with is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.569 
that I'm gonna not have my knife for
probably<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> month<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:02.340> probably

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
probably a month and that's probably

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
probably a month and that's probably
that's<00:02:02.790> being<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.799> conservative<00:02:04.799> it's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that's being a little conservative it's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.210 
that's being a little conservative it's
probably<00:02:05.340> longer<00:02:05.610> than<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:07.439> anyway<00:02:07.740> my

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
probably longer than that but anyway my

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
blade was not centered and here you go

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.710 
blade was not centered and here you go
I'll<00:02:10.649> try<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> show<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.459> here

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'll try and show this here

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.699 
I'll try and show this here
it's<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:14.260> very<00:02:14.830> easy<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.610> tell<00:02:16.530> from<00:02:17.530> this

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
it's not very easy to tell from this

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.960 
it's not very easy to tell from this
angle<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.250> I'll<00:02:18.370> try<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.790> few

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
angle so I'll try and get a few

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.650 
angle so I'll try and get a few
different<00:02:19.300> angles

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.820 

yeah<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:22.959> as<00:02:23.110> noticeable<00:02:23.260> there<00:02:23.680> but

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
yeah it's not as noticeable there but

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.020 
yeah it's not as noticeable there but
let<00:02:23.950> me<00:02:24.040> pull<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> blade<00:02:24.489> out<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> little<00:02:24.819> bit

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
let me pull the blade out a little bit

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.870 
let me pull the blade out a little bit
and<00:02:25.209> put<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:26.380> at<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.530> edge<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:27.489> now<00:02:27.819> you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
and put it right at the edge so now you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.860 
and put it right at the edge so now you
can<00:02:28.150> see<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.600> little<00:02:28.720> more<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.720> little

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
can see it's a little more it's a little

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.280 
can see it's a little more it's a little
more<00:02:36.090> off-center<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.050> know<00:02:38.080> you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
more off-center and you can you know you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.979 
more off-center and you can you know you
can<00:02:38.470> see<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.769> there<00:02:39.360> especially<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.720> spot

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
can see it there especially in that spot

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.250 
can see it there especially in that spot
it's<00:02:41.200> clearly<00:02:41.700> more<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.269> root<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it's clearly more to the root to the the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.559 
it's clearly more to the root to the the
locking<00:02:44.680> side<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.489> frame<00:02:45.940> than<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.540> on

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
locking side of the frame than it is on

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.840 
locking side of the frame than it is on
the<00:02:46.930> non-locking<00:02:47.260> side<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.430> see<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the non-locking side you can see the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.580 
the non-locking side you can see the
large<00:02:49.350> let<00:02:50.350> me<00:02:50.620> get<00:02:50.799> my<00:02:50.950> pointer<00:02:51.280> right<00:02:51.580> here

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
large let me get my pointer right here

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.720 
large let me get my pointer right here
you<00:02:53.590> can<00:02:53.799> see<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.190> larger<00:02:55.150> gap<00:02:56.400> right<00:02:57.400> along

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
you can see this larger gap right along

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.600 
you can see this larger gap right along
here<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:59.709> much<00:02:59.920> bigger<00:03:00.100> than<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> one<00:03:00.580> on

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
here it's much bigger than the one on

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.449 
here it's much bigger than the one on
this<00:03:00.819> side<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.750> very<00:03:01.900> small<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:03.069> still

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
this side it is very small but still

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.460 
this side it is very small but still
with<00:03:03.850> these<00:03:03.970> chris<00:03:04.209> reeve<00:03:04.330> knives<00:03:04.600> there's<00:03:05.230> no

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
with these chris reeve knives there's no

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.430 
with these chris reeve knives there's no
way<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.739> fix<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.610> if<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.630> could<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.049> fuck

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
way to fix that if I could just fuck

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.050 
way to fix that if I could just fuck
with<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.709> pivot<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.190> make<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.610> centered<00:03:09.940> I

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
with the pivot and make it centered I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.920 
with the pivot and make it centered I
would<00:03:10.209> do<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:13.180> not<00:03:13.360> going<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
would do that but that's not going to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
would do that but that's not going to
fix<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.260> no<00:03:14.350> matter<00:03:14.470> what<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.709> do<00:03:14.830> because<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
fix it no matter what I do because the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.759 
fix it no matter what I do because the
tolerances<00:03:16.480> are<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:16.780> tight<00:03:17.079> on<00:03:17.109> these<00:03:17.440> knifes

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
tolerances are so tight on these knifes

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.460 
tolerances are so tight on these knifes
that<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.390> can't<00:03:19.630> do<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.350> it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that you can't do that you put it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.960 
that you can't do that you put it
together<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.130> that's<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.609> how<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.940> goes

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
together and that's just how it goes

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.300 
together and that's just how it goes
together<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.530> I'm<00:03:23.680> starting<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.130> wonder

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
together and so I'm starting to wonder

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.240 
together and so I'm starting to wonder
like<00:03:24.760> are<00:03:25.390> my<00:03:25.660> scales<00:03:26.079> bent<00:03:26.440> like<00:03:26.739> mine<00:03:26.950> my

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
like are my scales bent like mine my

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.460 
like are my scales bent like mine my
blades<00:03:27.519> bent<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.239> was<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:28.480> nah<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:29.380> know

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
blades bent and I was like nah you know

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.830 
blades bent and I was like nah you know
it's<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.799> no<00:03:29.950> way<00:03:30.130> those<00:03:30.310> can't<00:03:30.549> be<00:03:30.640> bent<00:03:30.910> who

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
it's just no way those can't be bent who

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.640 
it's just no way those can't be bent who
gets<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.140> bent<00:03:32.470> Chris<00:03:33.430> Reeve<00:03:33.700> knife<00:03:33.940> well<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.650> can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
gets a bent Chris Reeve knife well I can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.800 
gets a bent Chris Reeve knife well I can

able<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.049> notice<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:39.700> most<00:03:39.970> likely

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
able to notice this it's most likely

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.849 
able to notice this it's most likely
gonna<00:03:40.329> be<00:03:40.450> very<00:03:40.780> hard<00:03:41.019> for<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.500> but<00:03:41.739> I've

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
noticed it if you pull the blade out

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.530 
noticed it if you pull the blade out
like<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.769> tell<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.970> blade<00:03:46.269> is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
like this you can tell that the blade is

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.390 
like this you can tell that the blade is
very<00:03:47.019> very<00:03:47.799> slightly<00:03:48.400> bent<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.870> right<00:03:50.049> and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
bent and I wish I could get the angle I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.920 
bent and I wish I could get the angle I
had<00:04:04.859> maybe<00:04:05.859> I<00:04:05.980> need<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.160> put<00:04:06.370> something<00:04:06.549> dark

question<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:23.130> hope<00:06:23.310> that<00:06:23.550> there's<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.180> way<00:06:24.360> for

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
question I hope that there's a way for

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.390 
question I hope that there's a way for
them<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.750> tell<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.320> it<00:06:25.470> came<00:06:25.740> that<00:06:25.980> way<00:06:26.190> and

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
them to tell that it came that way and

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.280 
them to tell that it came that way and
it<00:06:26.520> wasn't<00:06:26.700> something<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.300> did<00:06:27.390> I<00:06:27.780> mean<00:06:28.080> I

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
it wasn't something that I did I mean I

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.750 
it wasn't something that I did I mean I
noticed<00:06:28.500> it<00:06:28.740> right<00:06:28.860> away<00:06:28.980> but<00:06:29.250> I<00:06:29.310> didn't<00:06:29.610> think

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
noticed it right away but I didn't think

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.240 
noticed it right away but I didn't think
it<00:06:29.940> was<00:06:30.030> I<00:06:30.300> couldn't<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:31.200> just<00:06:31.770> didn't<00:06:32.070> want<00:06:32.190> to

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
it was I couldn't I just didn't want to

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.560 
it was I couldn't I just didn't want to
send<00:06:32.430> in<00:06:32.640> and<00:06:32.790> want<00:06:32.910> to<00:06:32.940> be<00:06:33.060> without<00:06:33.210> my<00:06:33.360> knife

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
send in and want to be without my knife

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.270 
send in and want to be without my knife
so<00:06:33.870> I<00:06:33.900> didn't<00:06:34.200> want<00:06:34.350> that<00:06:34.500> it's<00:06:34.710> been<00:06:34.890> a<00:06:34.920> month

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
so I didn't want that it's been a month

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.610 
so I didn't want that it's been a month
or<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.700> month<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.270> a<00:06:36.360> half<00:06:36.390> I<00:06:36.750> hope<00:06:37.350> they<00:06:37.500> don't

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
or a month and a half I hope they don't

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.350 
or a month and a half I hope they don't
think<00:06:37.920> that<00:06:37.950> like<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.400> used<00:06:38.730> it<00:06:38.910> for<00:06:39.090> a<00:06:39.120> month

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
think that like I used it for a month

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.570 
think that like I used it for a month
bent<00:06:39.840> it<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.230> then<00:06:40.470> sending<00:06:41.040> it<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.250> get<00:06:41.370> back

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
bent it and then sending it to get back

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.170 
bent it and then sending it to get back
so<00:06:41.790> I<00:06:41.850> really<00:06:42.120> hope<00:06:42.270> that<00:06:42.390> they<00:06:43.320> know<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:44.180> it

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
so I really hope that they know that it

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.550 
so I really hope that they know that it
was<00:06:45.300> bent<00:06:45.510> from<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:45.750> factory<00:06:46.170> and<00:06:46.320> I<00:06:46.410> hope

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
was bent from the factory and I hope

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.580 
was bent from the factory and I hope
maybe<00:06:46.830> someone<00:06:47.370> else<00:06:47.490> is<00:06:47.670> already<00:06:47.880> maybe<00:06:48.210> the

maybe someone else is already maybe the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.240 
maybe someone else is already maybe the
