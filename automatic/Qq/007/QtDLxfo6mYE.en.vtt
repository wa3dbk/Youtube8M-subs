00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 representation of the frank model 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.680
 hebert and we are going to understand this model 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.680
 We are going to put an example 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.070
 and well let's grab as an example 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:22.270
 to a man working 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.870
 I am fell from some stairs and died 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.000
 then the loss 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.260
 that's life 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.260
 of the worker 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 and why it happened because there goes to the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.160
 accident that was 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.160
 fall off the ladder 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.410
 died because he fell off the stairs and the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.410
 immediate cause 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.170
 it was that they are the acts and the conditions 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.629
 unsafe 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.600
 it was not because then the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.900
 ladder because the ladder was not in 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.050
 bad conditions 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.670
 it was not well fastened then 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.689
 the unsafe act was 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.689
 do not hold 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.430
 all right 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.430
 stairs 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 and why it happened good why 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.060
 here personal factors are handled 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.100
 and the factors of work 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.100
 the personal factors good 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 with the day 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830
 good 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.430
 do not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.460
 do not 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.460
 well I was distracted 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.259
 and the factors of work was 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 I had 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.310
 they did not have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.310
 a 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.310
 stairs 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.300
 in good conditions 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.130
 and because 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.650
 here the programs are handled 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.370
 inadequate the inadequate standards and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.550
 the proper fulfillment then 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.080
 here, he 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.610
 I was distracted and did not notice well 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.610
 not especially on the ladder 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.019
 besides that the download was not in 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.019
 good conditions because the company 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.459
 nole 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.459
 he did not warn him 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.610
 that the ladder is already very loose 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.040
 then there you know 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.930
 that the one that the company does not 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.240
 noticed that the staircase was very very 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.490
 loose by 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.820
 because the fulfillment was not given 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.910
 adequate of the blog's standards 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.020
 program and then 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.620
 the distracted state and how he did not have a 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.560
 good condition the ladder 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.260
 I do not know if not, as not subject the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.819
 ladder fell and lost his life 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.819
 then there is 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.819
 this is a model of franz causation 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.030
 schubert and we can see 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.569
 how did we solve the problem of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.569
 accident
