00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 tutorial does not start then the first 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.770
 You'll get a piece of furniture like that. 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.020
 the region that said there I'll do what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.200
 I like to get a ribbon that I chose. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.620
 this pink here and I'll get it with the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.330
 two grains and can tie but it worked 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.090
 for me to do so but if you have 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.120
 difficulties and tie the ribbon here in the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 Hair is for me, it's all right then. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.110
 I'll do it this way I saw it. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 that day 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.229
 I'm going to loose my little sister along with the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 from above we had separated 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.290
 I will divide it into three equal parts 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:22.380
 are the parts of France 1 1 2 and 3 can 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.350
 in the third hour here is the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.210
 Glitter, okay, I'll start doing it like a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.290
 built-in braid 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.990
 so from the front throw back the leaves 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.380
 who had here separated from behind 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.810
 play forward 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.320
 Okay, now that we're going to talk, see the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.120
 that there is the day braid so I continue 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.550
 Here I take the tape, let it come. 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.290
 now positioning takes a bit of 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.480
 hair because like the inlay I have 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.440
 always attach the parts of sheets with 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.700
 Come on in. I'm going to play the game here. 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.650
 this here 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.650
 this movement the tape is here already already 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.290
 got in here in the middle ok now I go 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.500
 take that back part I'll pass that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.330
 pass the tape over 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.270
 sure that before that we have to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:20.060
 So here, look, I'm just going to get it. 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:23.900
 the one with hair in here 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.270
 Okay, you can tape it over and get the party ready. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.600
 from the front we'll go underneath 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:34.360
 now it goes under, it does the same 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.960
 thing in butte hair always inlays in 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.050
 forrÃ³ now passes under the ribbon 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.660
 Look, here, you went by rock and in 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.950
 followed in the famous part above 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:56.570
 so over the top of the tape 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:59.600
 Ok, this part down but always 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.050
 then picks up a party in whose 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.750
 life under then once even goes 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.190
 Going up started from below 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.340
 same thing this time over 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:19.220

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.120

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:14.330

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:20.599
 will get it from here now or in 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:22.030
 here life underneath hair over is 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.569
 a little more 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.060
 Here, my daughter had ours here in 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:34.190
 I've always been feeling the thigh in the band. 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:37.490
 from the middle is hair goes down there handle 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:40.219
 a little hair and put obstacles 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.659
 until the end, why not now? 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:46.250
 there is more what you inhale then you pass 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:54.580
 tape in the hair the daughter always in the center 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:06:00.550
 O underneath it was in the middle 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.550
 and in the end it opens here 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.210
 and stay like this and now just repeat the 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.490
 process on the other side but if you do not 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.720

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
