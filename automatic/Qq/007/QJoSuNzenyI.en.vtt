00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 Now I want to tell you about the car 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.830
 cat on which i travel by 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.900
 swiss before this all over europe i 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.889
 drove the little ones in cars 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.509
 it was BMW unit opel corsa 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 hyundai i35 that is, it was all 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 small cars on which they are all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 were a gray which is somehow strange 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 long time ago and all the cars in the rental were 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 gray and now I decided to take a little 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 bigger car is mazda cx 5 and what 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 the most amazing thing is she is also gray 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.430
 Imagine what the hell 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.890
 or 5 car in Europe which I take 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.649
 for rent I am again gray well what can 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 say about the bridge 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.110
 Basically a good car was waiting on 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 really worst of this car 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.050
 the places that I now have in it are real to me 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.579
 like I like it very much 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 really weak overclocking to a hundred there 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.420
 89 seconds drive me takes after 8 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.500
 auto 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 it stands still but generally if you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.010
 will take a similar car I would 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.470
 recommended his salon very much 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.479
 practical here is everything you need 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 in order to comfortably exist 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 here is my phone with navigation now we 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.270
 going to montreux right in the city ​​center what 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 want to say a few words about cars 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 Generally Switzerland probably Switzerland 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 the largest number of porsche range 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.579
 rover of a mercedes audi in general all 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.780
 with premium cars here 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.370
 ferrari of course goes great 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.710
 this is the first time 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 in europe when i see so much expensive 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.960
 cars 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.260
 but not surprisingly let's say Geneva 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.450
 there are the largest headquarters 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.360
 world corporations naturally 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.970
 employees of these corporations earn 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.750
 by and truly gigantic money what 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.760
 say let's say salaries so clerk in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.800
 Geneva is 400 thousand dollars and 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.510
 only the initial rate that is how 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.060
 only you get a job up to 400 to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.890
 1000 dollars you get well and 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 unconditionally ride in this case on 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.800
 whether ferrari porsche for the head of the department 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.810
 who would receive 15 20 thousand dollars 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.260
 per month or even euro it is quite 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 normal cars 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.870
 but behind my back it opens again 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.720
 view of montreux is a very beautiful city and we 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.790
 follow on and explore that there is 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 countries on the subject of the same car 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.520
 Dmitry was there with you 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 Cheryomushkin happily
