Paul<00:00:38.070> says<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.879> 32gb<00:00:39.300> rim<00:00:39.629> doesn't<00:00:40.080> come

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
Paul says well the 32gb rim doesn't come

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.970 
Paul says well the 32gb rim doesn't come
with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> air<00:00:41.010> flow<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> air<00:00:41.880> flow<00:00:42.059> bro

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
with the air flow or the air flow bro

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.170 
with the air flow or the air flow bro
which<00:00:43.980> I'll<00:00:44.130> be<00:00:44.219> explaining<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> minute<00:00:44.969> but

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
which I'll be explaining in a minute but

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.430 
which I'll be explaining in a minute but
to<00:00:46.170> others<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> 16<00:00:47.399> gig<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.989> 8<00:00:49.170> gate

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to others like the 16 gig and the 8 gate

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.700 
to others like the 16 gig and the 8 gate
they<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.950> come<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> air<00:00:52.079> flow<00:00:52.290> which<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
they do come with the air flow which is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
they do come with the air flow which is
in<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> box<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.280> I've<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.579> pulled

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
in this box but I've actually pulled

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
in this box but I've actually pulled
that<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> already<00:00:54.360> assembled<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that and already assembled it it's this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
that and already assembled it it's this
kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> board<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.450> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
kind of board here and what it is it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.010 
kind of board here and what it is it's
just<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.640> thing<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.760> sits<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.809> rim

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
just like thing which sits over your rim

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.600 
just like thing which sits over your rim
and<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.890> fan<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.550> gonna

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
and it's like a fan like if you're gonna

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.660 
and it's like a fan like if you're gonna
overclock<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.840> am<00:01:04.339> don't<00:01:05.339> freak<00:01:05.550> out

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
overclock like I am don't freak out

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
overclock like I am don't freak out
there<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.390> 32<00:01:06.690> gig<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> ram<00:01:07.050> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
there you have like 32 gig of ram and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.990 
there you have like 32 gig of ram and
I'm<00:01:07.440> still<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.860> overclock<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.850> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I'm still gonna overclock that's just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
I'm still gonna overclock that's just
how<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.149> like<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:11.180> yeah<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.350> top

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
how I like it but yeah and then on top

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
how I like it but yeah and then on top
of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> inflow<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.610> what's<00:01:15.210> called

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
of the inflow you can get what's called

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.260 
of the inflow you can get what's called
an<00:01:15.750> airflow<00:01:16.680> probe<00:01:17.010> which<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.850> nice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
an airflow probe which is like a nice

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
an airflow probe which is like a nice
LED<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.140> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> got<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> looks

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
LED I kind of got up more for the looks

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.530 
LED I kind of got up more for the looks
then<00:01:20.900> for<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:24.390> just

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
then for the use of it but that's just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.859 
then for the use of it but that's just
me<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:27.600> LED

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
me it's pretty much like a little LED

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.820 
me it's pretty much like a little LED
monitor<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.979> lights<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:31.560> based

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
monitor which lights up for like based

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.469 
monitor which lights up for like based
on<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.340> heat<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> usage<00:01:33.210> or

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
on like your heat or the usage or

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
on like your heat or the usage or
anything<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.049> em<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.490> attach<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
anything of your em and you attach it to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
anything of your em and you attach it to
the<00:01:36.240> top<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.990> airflow<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the top of your airflow and it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
the top of your airflow and it's
obviously<00:01:39.060> called<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> airflow<00:01:39.540> probe<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
obviously called the airflow probe and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
obviously called the airflow probe and
it<00:01:40.320> sits<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.680> top<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> come<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it sits on top like that and I come it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.340 
it sits on top like that and I come it
comes<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.630> everything<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> screws

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
comes with everything like the screws

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.840 
comes with everything like the screws
there's<00:01:43.530> nothing<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> need<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.640> pretty

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there's nothing all you need but pretty

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.190 
there's nothing all you need but pretty
much<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.090> sits<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.450> top<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
much it sits on top of it like that and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
much it sits on top of it like that and
that<00:01:46.259> sits<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.799> top<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:47.790> motherboard

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that sits on top of your motherboard

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
that sits on top of your motherboard
which<00:01:48.360> I'll<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.570> showing<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.900> later<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.560> how

now<00:02:43.200> I've<00:02:43.349> already<00:02:43.590> put<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.730> cables<00:02:45.120> into

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
now I've already put in the cables into

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.030 
now I've already put in the cables into
the<00:02:45.689> bottom<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.049> on<00:02:46.379> yours<00:02:46.709> you'll<00:02:46.859> be<00:02:46.950> able

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the bottom here on yours you'll be able

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.970 
the bottom here on yours you'll be able
to<00:02:47.189> see<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.609> lot<00:02:47.909> better<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:49.260> cables

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to see it a lot better but the cables

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.160 
to see it a lot better but the cables
which<00:02:50.129> come<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.689> the<00:02:52.069> library<00:02:53.069> now<00:02:54.079> with<00:02:55.079> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
which come with the library now with the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
which come with the library now with the
airflow<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.829> would<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.189> like<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.670> both<00:02:56.879> sides

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
airflow you would get like on both sides

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.960 
airflow you would get like on both sides
if<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.109> four<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.409> these<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.879> a

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
if you have four of these but with a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.940 
if you have four of these but with a
flipper<00:03:00.299> come<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:01.230> long<00:03:01.379> ones<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.739> like

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
flipper come to the long ones here like

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.720 
flipper come to the long ones here like
that<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.299> then<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.720> pretty<00:03:03.900> much<00:03:04.079> just<00:03:04.730> have

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
that and then you pretty much just have

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.179 
that and then you pretty much just have
to<00:03:05.879> make<00:03:06.810> sure<00:03:06.959> all<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.620> book<00:03:07.769> them<00:03:07.889> all<00:03:08.040> in

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
to make sure all you book them all in

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:16.309 
to make sure all you book them all in
because<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.549> harder<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.819> do

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.500 

smoke<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.189> in<00:03:17.310> make<00:03:17.519> sure<00:03:17.700> at<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> bottom

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
smoke it in make sure at the bottom

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.100 
smoke it in make sure at the bottom
everything's<00:03:19.409> alright<00:03:19.739> still<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.510> then

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.500 

a<00:03:26.140> chance<00:03:26.860> group

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
a chance group

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.010 
a chance group
I<00:03:28.540> found<00:03:29.080> it's<00:03:29.230> pretty<00:03:29.440> easy<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:30.870> don't<00:03:31.870> really

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
I found it's pretty easy to don't really

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:43.120 
I found it's pretty easy to don't really
stop<00:03:32.290> something<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.250> looks<00:03:33.430> quite<00:03:34.060> nice

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.870 

now<00:03:44.020> don't<00:03:45.020> get<00:03:45.170> confused<00:03:45.380> but<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.580> lot<00:03:46.790> of

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
now don't get confused but a lot of

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.120 
now don't get confused but a lot of
people<00:03:47.150> I've<00:03:47.300> seen<00:03:47.540> these<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.680> actually<00:03:49.010> go

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
people I've seen these that actually go

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.380 
people I've seen these that actually go
to<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.430> motherboard<00:03:49.790> or<00:03:49.910> anything<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.240> go

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
to a motherboard or anything they go

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.980 
to a motherboard or anything they go
into<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.990> RAM<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.410> something<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.300> I'm<00:03:53.870> just

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
into the RAM in something so I'm just

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.450 
into the RAM in something so I'm just
going<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.200> go<00:03:54.320> put<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.830> RAM<00:03:54.980> in<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.370> then

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
going to go put all the RAM in and then

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.160 
going to go put all the RAM in and then
I'll<00:03:55.850> hook<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.210> in<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.690> show<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.900> how<00:03:56.990> it's

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
I'll hook this in and show you how it's

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.170 
I'll hook this in and show you how it's
done

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
done

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.390 
done
okay<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.210> pretty<00:03:59.750> did<00:04:00.110> these<00:04:00.470> three<00:04:00.770> because<00:04:01.100> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
okay I pretty did these three because it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160 
okay I pretty did these three because it
is<00:04:01.490> a<00:04:01.520> bit<00:04:01.730> tricky<00:04:01.850> but<00:04:02.300> I'll<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:02.810> show<00:04:03.020> you

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
is a bit tricky but I'll just show you

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:22.230 
is a bit tricky but I'll just show you
one<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.790> hook<00:04:05.450> in

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.140 

make<00:04:22.810> sure<00:04:22.990> little<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:24.340> know<00:04:24.430> correctly<00:04:25.000> in

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
make sure little you know correctly in

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.110 
make sure little you know correctly in
and<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.449> make<00:04:26.110> sure<00:04:26.259> or<00:04:26.560> tables<00:04:27.190> up<00:04:27.490> got

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
and that make sure or tables up got

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.210 
and that make sure or tables up got
plenty<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.419> room

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
plenty of room

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:38.430 
plenty of room
then<00:04:31.650> with<00:04:32.650> this<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:36.330> carefully<00:04:37.440> speak

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
then with this just to carefully speak

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:53.480 
then with this just to carefully speak
tricky

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.550 

okay<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.360> then

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
okay and then

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:24.629 
okay and then
the<00:04:56.070> screws

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.980 

and<00:05:25.360> then<00:05:26.009> once<00:05:27.009> it's<00:05:27.189> all<00:05:27.340> set<00:05:28.240> up<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.539> get

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
and then once it's all set up you get

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.980 
and then once it's all set up you get
this<00:05:29.139> cable<00:05:29.530> just<00:05:29.889> a<00:05:30.069> bit<00:05:30.219> out<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.580> way<00:05:30.990> and

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
this cable just a bit out of the way and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:44.640 
this cable just a bit out of the way and
then<00:05:32.110> kind<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.189> stretch

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.800 

and<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.870> kind<00:05:47.350> of<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.850> sits<00:05:48.850> like<00:05:49.030> that<00:05:49.060> can

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
and that kind of just sits like that can

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.370 
and that kind of just sits like that can
I<00:05:49.840> adjust<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:51.040> a<00:05:51.100> bit<00:05:51.160> if<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:51.580> need<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.960> why
