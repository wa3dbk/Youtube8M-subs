00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello so today I want to know 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.740
 how to clean his computer screen 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 so for that you will need a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 wet mop and a dishcloth 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.390
 so we'll go straight to the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.260
 realization to the realization of how 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.539
 clean the screen 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 so we notice very well that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.840
 the computer screen and dirty so you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.640
 go make left moves to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 right from bottom to top and from top to bottom 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.129
 with a wet rush or a dish towel 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 wet end to ben things with what 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.890
 you can do it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.800
 it is for example also a glove of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 clean toilet faults also serves 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.420
 clean toilet but especially not 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.940
 with sopalin because this parent 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 crumbles and you're going to have a lot of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.120
 pieces on your screen and will take 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 two hours to re clean air so 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.449
 after moving left 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.010
 basic water and tobacco rights 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.790
 wanted those thirty seconds your 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.790
 screen to dry 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.439
 once your screen a whole that can 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.509
 to dry it will still be wet but the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.360
 drops will be said head so it's up to 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.310
 that moment that it is necessary that one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 wipe so you'll take a 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 dish towel like I'm doing there you go 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 put your index finger on the corner of a corner 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.140
 a judo corner remake thinking with your 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.740
 hand and you're going to make rounds 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 circular like these one without too much 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 press to avoid damaging the screen 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.790
 and there our screen is clean like new 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.060
 and here we can notice that our 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:57.340
 screen flickers clean and there is 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.080
 more problem of visibility and dirt 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.549
 on your screen here I hope this 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.549
