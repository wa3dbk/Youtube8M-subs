00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
begin you're going to take and make a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.479 
begin you're going to take and make a
loop<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.580> loop<00:02:43.610> around<00:02:44.260> your<00:02:45.260> thumb<00:02:45.530> just<00:02:46.280> like

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
loop to loop around your thumb just like

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.120 
loop to loop around your thumb just like
so<00:02:46.849> kind<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.900> rollercoaster<00:02:48.349> looping

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
so kind of like a rollercoaster looping

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.840 
so kind of like a rollercoaster looping
around<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:51.140> shiny<00:02:51.530> side<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:51.980> facing<00:02:52.400> up

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
around and the shiny side is facing up

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.210 
around and the shiny side is facing up
and<00:02:53.030> your<00:02:53.330> fingers<00:02:53.810> are<00:02:53.989> held<00:02:54.260> with<00:02:54.830> two

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and your fingers are held with two

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.030 
and your fingers are held with two
fingers<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.090> thumb<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.170> patterning<00:02:57.860> is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
fingers and a thumb so the patterning is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.520 
fingers and a thumb so the patterning is
sort<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.370> like<00:02:58.519> when<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.790> flute<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.209> pie<00:02:59.450> crust

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
sort of like when you flute a pie crust

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.520 
sort of like when you flute a pie crust
so<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.799> loop<00:03:01.100> around<00:03:01.370> your<00:03:01.940> thumb<00:03:02.530> two

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
so it's a loop around your thumb two

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.289 
so it's a loop around your thumb two
fingers<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:05.569> twist<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.610> each<00:03:07.819> side

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
fingers and then twist so that each side

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.990 
fingers and then twist so that each side
stays<00:03:08.870> shiny<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.590> I've<00:03:09.680> got<00:03:09.830> shiny<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.459> shiny

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
stays shiny so I've got shiny a shiny

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.199 
stays shiny so I've got shiny a shiny
loop<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.510> shiny

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.630 

the<00:03:14.870> loop-de-loop<00:03:15.469> makes<00:03:15.829> your<00:03:16.010> Center<00:03:16.400> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
the loop-de-loop makes your Center and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.729 
the loop-de-loop makes your Center and
now<00:03:17.090> you're<00:03:17.269> ready<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.599> move<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.290> add<00:03:18.500> your

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
now you're ready to move on and add your

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.690 
now you're ready to move on and add your
sides<00:03:19.090> loop<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.599> back<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.590> under<00:03:22.549> your

and give it a sharp twist and set the

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.369 
and give it a sharp twist and set the
bottom<00:03:28.489> finger<00:03:28.760> back<00:03:28.939> down<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.629> then<00:03:30.260> you

by twisting you're always keeping the

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.780 
by twisting you're always keeping the
shiny<00:03:38.540> side<00:03:38.810> facing<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:40.189> repeat<00:03:40.609> that

bottom twist set it back down by doing

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.440 
bottom twist set it back down by doing
two<00:03:47.629> fingers<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.319> your<00:03:48.560> thumb<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.519> allows<00:03:49.970> you

two fingers and your thumb it allows you

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.070 
two fingers and your thumb it allows you
to<00:03:50.720> keep<00:03:51.230> control<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.430> what<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.389> want<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:53.870> do

to keep control of what you want to do

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.530 
to keep control of what you want to do
next<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.190> three<00:03:57.550> more<00:03:57.820> loops<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.420> are

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
next is three more loops that are

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.230 
next is three more loops that are
slightly<00:03:58.810> larger<00:03:59.230> so<00:04:00.160> one<00:04:01.230> twist<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:04.000> on<00:04:04.150> the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
slightly larger so one twist one on the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.610 
slightly larger so one twist one on the
other<00:04:04.360> side<00:04:05.190> twist<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.540> second<00:04:08.140> one<00:04:08.320> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
other side twist and the second one and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.000 
other side twist and the second one and
notice<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.760> lift<00:04:10.030> one<00:04:10.300> finger<00:04:10.630> then<00:04:11.380> lift<00:04:11.740> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
notice I lift one finger then lift the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.210 
notice I lift one finger then lift the
other<00:04:12.330> bring<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.480> down<00:04:13.920> second<00:04:14.920> one<00:04:15.040> on<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
other bring it down second one on the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.380 
other bring it down second one on the
opposite<00:04:15.850> side<00:04:17.040> twist<00:04:18.040> now<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.000> go<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
opposite side twist now I go to the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.140 
opposite side twist now I go to the
third<00:04:19.720> loop<00:04:20.610> under<00:04:21.610> the<00:04:21.730> top<00:04:21.940> finger<00:04:23.130> lift<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
third loop under the top finger lift and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.680 
third loop under the top finger lift and
down<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.350> then<00:04:27.250> twist

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.650 

once<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.830> have<00:04:31.070> your<00:04:31.250> one<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:32.030> center<00:04:32.300> loop

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
once you have your one the center loop
