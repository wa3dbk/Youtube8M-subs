to risk these strawberries you got to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.870 
to risk these strawberries you got to
make<00:03:21.480> sure<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.080> really<00:03:22.880> creamy

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
make sure that it's a really creamy

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:38.010 
make sure that it's a really creamy
consistency<00:03:27.650> eat<00:03:28.650> out<00:03:28.799> all<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.010> lumps

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.180 

so<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:38.710> that<00:03:38.860> looks<00:03:39.070> like<00:03:39.190> cake<00:03:40.090> batter<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
so if that looks like cake batter and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.520 
so if that looks like cake batter and
then<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.670> it's<00:03:45.880> really<00:03:46.330> simple<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:50.260> take

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
then there it's really simple just take

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.990 
then there it's really simple just take
the<00:03:50.680> strawberries<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.370> want<00:03:51.610> rinsed

the strawberries that you want rinsed
off<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.890> make<00:03:53.890> sure<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.100> dry<00:03:54.370> out<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:54.550> that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
off and make sure you dry out so that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.900 
off and make sure you dry out so that
it's<00:03:55.000> six<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.250> just<00:03:57.340> going<00:03:57.490> to<00:03:57.610> dip<00:03:57.760> the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
it's six and you just going to dip the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.070 
it's six and you just going to dip the
strawberries<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.750> little<00:04:01.960> bit

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
strawberries like this is a little bit

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.790 
strawberries like this is a little bit
big<00:04:02.590> still<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:05.080> probably<00:04:05.350> thin<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.680> out<00:04:05.740> a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
big still so probably thin it out a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.120 
big still so probably thin it out a
little<00:04:05.980> bit<00:04:08.970> like<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.500> then<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.800> put<00:04:11.980> them

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
little bit like that then just put them

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.820 
little bit like that then just put them
onto<00:04:12.280> your<00:04:12.670> wax<00:04:12.910> paper<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:15.090> there<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.209> go<00:04:16.830> I'm

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
onto your wax paper and there you go I'm

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.300

actually going to add a little bit more
milk<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:28.060> thin<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.300> out<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.570> bit<00:04:28.660> more<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.950> it's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
milk to thin it out a bit more so it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:52.930

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.320 
back in now you can do this on a double
boiler<00:05:16.500> as<00:05:16.980> well<00:05:17.220> use<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.520> double<00:05:17.790> boiler<00:05:17.970> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
boiler as well use a double boiler to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.770 
boiler as well use a double boiler to
use<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.930> melt<00:05:19.110> chocolate<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:21.510> quicker

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
use to melt chocolate but it's quicker

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.350 
use to melt chocolate but it's quicker

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
and easier just sold in the micro so how

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:35.659 
and easier just sold in the micro so how
