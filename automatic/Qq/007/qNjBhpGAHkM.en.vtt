00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 good morning from the united states we go 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.810
 to tell what has ended here 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.000
 recently that is the morning of work that 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.670
 a morning was just ended 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 rather intense with the first of the two 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.800
 workouts scheduled for the day 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.750
 two training sessions today as it will be 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 custom throughout the period but the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.109
 plan in detail why there are so many 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 things to go to tell you start 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.480
 with classic heating then 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 complete group for the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 warm-up work after that yes 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 continue and continue with all that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 which is the traditional menu in these 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 cases first part apart maybe more 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
 important of the day a job a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 care of professor pondrelli rather 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.059
 so much physical work is important 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.640
 with a series of exercises a series of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.070
 movements that the whole group has 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.149
 carried out in different areas of the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 playing field 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.800
 all this while the goalkeepers instead 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.549
 they worked separately then the group 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 divides a part of the work of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.659
 individual technique while another 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.229
 part carries out work by nature 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.049
 tactics 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 apart they have done training 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 milito but then will enter the part 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 conclusive and both joel obi and matteo 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 kovacic for their aerobic work 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 rather important on this day 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 some exercises a bit of work with i 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 trainers and then a lot of aerobic work 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 but then comes the most awaited part too 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.530
 the American media were many in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.680
 edge field because why he came to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 train with our kids one of the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.729
 nba's greatest basketball players 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.070
 that is steve nash player that unique 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.070
 white in the last few years to win 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 individual rewards such as the player at 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.259
 pp of the year in short, in a discipline 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.579
 where the color players are those 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.590
 that he is the master he succeeded 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.420
 to excel a few seasons ago 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.979
 in short, he also has great passion for 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.780
 football and then sooner or later 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.470
 heating with professor pondrelli 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.180
 then a bit of dribbles a bit of steps 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.980
 manor cordoba which curiosity has 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.600
 retouched the ball for the first time 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.430
 after he left the football and if he did 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.520
 he realized when he started a little 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 fiddle with exits after which after 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.880
 having greeted the team after 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
 greeted met walter marrarri 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 ready via steve nash jersey number 10 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.050
 in the field to do the final practice match 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.600
 a training session in which he moved with 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.540
 of the good plays he had noticed that he has 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.690
 always looked for by first plays is between 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.700
 the other with good technique with good 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
 we didn't have physical strength 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.480
 absolutely doubts in short as it happens 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.620
 a rather intense morning with 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.110
 so much work and then with the curiosity of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.360
 see a big basketball star 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.940
 put yourself on a par with our players 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.920
 among other things he plays in a role that he is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.900
 comparable to that of change and there is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.730
 was a time when the cuchu during 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.220
 the practice match gave him some 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.320
 indications and how to do it in 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 these cases morning which is spun off 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.459
 in this way 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.050
 lunch before long after that 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.170

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.650
 representation a delegation will leave 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.300
