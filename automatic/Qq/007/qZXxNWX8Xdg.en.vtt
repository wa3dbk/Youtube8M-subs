00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
whoever you're working with isn't going

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.930 
whoever you're working with isn't going
to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> afraid<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.590> mess<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.069> paper<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.640> or

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
to be afraid to mess of paper up or

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.869 
to be afraid to mess of paper up or
whatever<00:02:09.289> because<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.400> cheap<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
whatever because it's just so cheap and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.559 
whatever because it's just so cheap and
there's<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.239> much

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
there's so much

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.300 
there's so much
to<00:02:12.689> fit<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.140> they'll<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.499> able<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.950> express

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to fit that they'll be able to express

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.000 
to fit that they'll be able to express
themselves<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:14.969> more<00:02:15.150> fluency<00:02:15.859> then<00:02:16.859> you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
themselves with more fluency then you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.030 
themselves with more fluency then you
need<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.219> ruler<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.090> here's<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.290> ruler<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> use

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
need a ruler so here's the ruler I use

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.699 
need a ruler so here's the ruler I use
you<00:02:20.340> see<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.670> got<00:02:20.819> real<00:02:21.269> nice<00:02:21.719> thickness<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
you see it's got real nice thickness to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.339 
you see it's got real nice thickness to
it<00:02:22.739> that's<00:02:23.519> what<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> use<00:02:23.969> to<00:02:23.999> make<00:02:24.239> these<00:02:24.629> you

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
it that's what I use to make these you

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.289 
it that's what I use to make these you
want<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.769> for<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> longer<00:02:26.459> ruler<00:02:27.090> you're

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
want to go for a longer ruler you're

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.209 
want to go for a longer ruler you're
using<00:02:27.540> bigger<00:02:27.900> paper<00:02:28.230> maybe<00:02:28.620> something<00:02:29.069> like

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
using bigger paper maybe something like

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.069 
using bigger paper maybe something like
this<00:02:29.400> metal<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:29.909> I've<00:02:30.090> had<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.780> many

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
this metal one I've had this for many

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.349 
this metal one I've had this for many
many<00:02:31.409> years<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.579> use<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.209> my

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
many years and I use this in my

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.330 
many years and I use this in my
classroom<00:02:33.409> sometimes<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.620> write<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.159> big

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
classroom sometimes to write on the big

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.610 
classroom sometimes to write on the big
white<00:02:35.549> board<00:02:35.879> or<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.209> chalkboard<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
white board or the chalkboard because I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.379 
white board or the chalkboard because I
can<00:02:37.950> make<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> nice<00:02:38.430> long<00:02:38.700> lines<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.359> that

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
can make the nice long lines with that

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.690 
can make the nice long lines with that
this<00:02:40.139> is<00:02:40.319> an<00:02:40.439> old<00:02:40.590> friend<00:02:41.010> I've<00:02:41.219> had<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.519> for

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
this is an old friend I've had it for

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.229 
this is an old friend I've had it for
many<00:02:41.969> many<00:02:42.269> long<00:02:42.599> years<00:02:42.629> decades<00:02:43.499> or<00:02:44.489> you

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
many many long years decades or you

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.289 
many many long years decades or you
could<00:02:45.450> possibly<00:02:45.959> use<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.760> t-square<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.060> might

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
could possibly use a t-square it might

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.479 
could possibly use a t-square it might
be<00:02:48.510> useful<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.260> considering<00:02:50.129> we're<00:02:50.310> using

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
be useful but considering we're using

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.300 
be useful but considering we're using
different<00:02:51.030> angles<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:52.079> might<00:02:52.379> not<00:02:52.739> be<00:02:53.040> your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
different angles this might not be your

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.409 
different angles this might not be your
best<00:02:53.340> choice<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.579> have<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.269> it

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
best choice really and if you have do it

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.809 
best choice really and if you have do it
it<00:02:57.540> means<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.709> could<00:02:58.859> just<00:02:59.069> use<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.549> these

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
it means you could just use one of these

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.970 
it means you could just use one of these
paint<00:03:00.629> mixing<00:03:01.049> sticks<00:03:01.469> which<00:03:01.650> are<00:03:01.829> available

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
paint mixing sticks which are available

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.449 
paint mixing sticks which are available
for<00:03:02.579> free<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.939> any<00:03:03.120> hardware<00:03:03.419> store<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.769> those

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
for free at any hardware store so those

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.879 
for free at any hardware store so those
are<00:03:05.699> the<00:03:05.849> basic<00:03:06.590> materials<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.709> you're

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
are the basic materials that you're

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.640 
are the basic materials that you're
going<00:03:07.919> to<00:03:08.040> need<00:03:08.219> just<00:03:08.250> pencil<00:03:08.760> ruler<00:03:08.969> and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
going to need just pencil ruler and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
going to need just pencil ruler and
paper<00:03:10.650> maybe<00:03:11.159> something<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.519> sharpen<00:03:11.939> those

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
paper maybe something to sharpen those

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.170 
paper maybe something to sharpen those
pencils<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.739> let<00:03:14.340> me<00:03:14.430> get<00:03:14.609> right<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.000> what

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
pencils with so let me get right to what

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
pencils with so let me get right to what
we're<00:03:15.359> gonna<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.719> doing<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:17.489> idea<00:03:17.879> behind

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
we're gonna be doing the idea behind

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.300 
we're gonna be doing the idea behind
this<00:03:18.659> is<00:03:19.099> not<00:03:20.099> just<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.819> copy<00:03:21.120> my<00:03:21.540> drawings<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
this is not just to copy my drawings the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.559 
this is not just to copy my drawings the
idea<00:03:23.729> is<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.479> use<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.620> copying<00:03:26.189> process<00:03:26.569> to

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
idea is to use the copying process to

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.210 
idea is to use the copying process to
gain<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> deeper<00:03:28.349> understanding<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:29.519> how<00:03:30.109> this

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
gain a deeper understanding of how this

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.009 
gain a deeper understanding of how this
vanishing<00:03:32.220> point<00:03:32.489> system<00:03:33.030> perspective

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
vanishing point system perspective

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.879 
vanishing point system perspective
drawing<00:03:34.290> works<00:03:35.479> now<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:37.079> going<00:03:37.439> to<00:03:37.500> go<00:03:37.620> into

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
drawing works now I'm going to go into

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.369 
drawing works now I'm going to go into
what<00:03:38.310> vanishing<00:03:38.879> points<00:03:39.299> are<00:03:39.479> and<00:03:40.169> that's

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
what vanishing points are and that's

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.259 
what vanishing points are and that's
gonna<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.889> like<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.370> core<00:03:41.759> of<00:03:41.909> what<00:03:42.120> we're

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
gonna be like the core of what we're

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.179 
gonna be like the core of what we're
doing<00:03:42.389> two-point<00:03:43.199> perspective<00:03:43.379> means<00:03:44.069> you

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
doing two-point perspective means you

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.569 
doing two-point perspective means you
have<00:03:44.370> two<00:03:44.639> vanishing<00:03:45.060> points<00:03:45.560> now<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:47.400> by

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
have two vanishing points now just by

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.179 
have two vanishing points now just by
way<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:47.849> introduction<00:03:48.540> again<00:03:49.290> I'm<00:03:49.919> going<00:03:50.129> to

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
way of introduction again I'm going to

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.550 
way of introduction again I'm going to
go<00:03:50.340> through<00:03:50.579> step<00:03:50.909> by<00:03:50.939> step<00:03:51.120> how<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.169> make

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
go through step by step how to make

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.909 
go through step by step how to make
these<00:03:52.889> specific<00:03:53.519> drawings<00:03:54.449> as<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:55.319> go<00:03:55.530> I'll<00:03:55.709> go

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
these specific drawings as I go I'll go

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.399 
these specific drawings as I go I'll go
through<00:03:56.189> them<00:03:56.370> step<00:03:56.699> by<00:03:56.729> step<00:03:56.989> each<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.290> of

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
through them step by step each one of

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.649 
through them step by step each one of
them<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.620> going<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.949> a<00:03:58.979> separate<00:03:59.489> video<00:03:59.699> the

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
them is going to be a separate video the

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.770 
them is going to be a separate video the
idea<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.109> for<00:04:01.469> you<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.620> copy<00:04:02.129> those<00:04:02.669> not<00:04:03.540> with

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
idea is for you to copy those not with

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.800 
idea is for you to copy those not with
the<00:04:03.989> idea<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.439> making<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.430> pretty<00:04:05.669> drawing<00:04:06.000> but

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the idea of making a pretty drawing but

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.189 
the idea of making a pretty drawing but
with<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.109> idea<00:04:07.469> of<00:04:07.849> understanding<00:04:08.849> why<00:04:09.719> it

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
with the idea of understanding why it

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.069 
with the idea of understanding why it
works<00:04:10.709> like<00:04:10.979> it<00:04:11.189> does<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:12.209> make<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.419> dry<00:04:12.750> where

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
works like it does to make a dry where

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.349 
works like it does to make a dry where
part<00:04:13.379> of<00:04:13.469> it<00:04:13.590> looks<00:04:13.799> close<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.519> see<00:04:15.180> that

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
part of it looks close to you see that

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.870 
part of it looks close to you see that
centerline<00:04:15.989> looks<00:04:16.259> close<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.070> part

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
centerline looks close to you and part

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.029 
centerline looks close to you and part
of<00:04:17.969> it<00:04:18.090> looks<00:04:18.269> far<00:04:18.570> away<00:04:18.870> these<00:04:19.109> two<00:04:19.380> end<00:04:19.650> lines

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
of it looks far away these two end lines

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.399 
of it looks far away these two end lines
the<00:04:20.729> ends<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> house<00:04:21.539> is<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.049> end<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.349> the

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
the ends of the house is the end of the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.320 
the ends of the house is the end of the
house<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:22.889> they<00:04:23.699> look<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.060> they're<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
house there they look like they're a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.650 
house there they look like they're a
little

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
little

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.990 
little
further<00:04:24.840> back<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:26.160> it's<00:04:26.370> done<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.760> very

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
further back and it's done in a very

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.270 
further back and it's done in a very
systematic<00:04:27.390> way<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.740> I'm<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.100> go

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
systematic way and I'm going to go

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.340 
systematic way and I'm going to go
through<00:04:29.640> what<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.150> system<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.020> that's<00:04:31.200> a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
through what that system is so that's a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.580 
through what that system is so that's a
simple<00:04:31.770> house<00:04:32.030> with<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> pitched<00:04:33.420> roof<00:04:33.750> some

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
simple house with a pitched roof some

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.990 
simple house with a pitched roof some
kids<00:04:34.830> think<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.250> looks<00:04:35.460> like<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.640> barn

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
kids think that looks like a barn

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.840 
kids think that looks like a barn
because<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.630> big<00:04:36.870> X<00:04:37.200> but<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.130> big<00:04:38.340> X<00:04:38.610> is

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
because of that big X but that big X is

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.030 
because of that big X but that big X is
really<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.420> part<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.900> measuring<00:04:40.440> system

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
really just part of a measuring system

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.600 
really just part of a measuring system
that<00:04:41.670> we're<00:04:41.850> going<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.090> use<00:04:42.980> here<00:04:43.980> I<00:04:44.040> have<00:04:44.400> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that we're going to use here I have the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.570 
that we're going to use here I have the
same<00:04:44.910> thing<00:04:45.330> except<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.200> put<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.860> little

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
same thing except I put a little

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150 
same thing except I put a little
sidewalk<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.560> lines<00:04:49.800> on<00:04:50.040> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
sidewalk on it and the lines on the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.010 
sidewalk on it and the lines on the
sidewalk<00:04:50.640> go<00:04:50.850> back<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.300> these<00:04:51.420> vanishing

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
sidewalk go back to these vanishing

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.260 
sidewalk go back to these vanishing
points<00:04:52.410> that's<00:04:53.010> gonna<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> video<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.120> do

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
points that's gonna be a video that I do

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.010 
points that's gonna be a video that I do
and<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:55.560> can<00:04:55.740> hear<00:04:55.980> about<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.930> here's<00:04:57.930> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
and you can hear about that here's a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.160 
and you can hear about that here's a
simple<00:04:58.560> house<00:04:59.000> with<00:05:00.000> windows<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.680> door<00:05:03.170> and

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
simple house with windows and a door and

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.160 
simple house with windows and a door and
here<00:05:04.470> I'm<00:05:04.650> exploring<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.460> idea<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.240> the

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
here I'm exploring the idea of the

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.460 
here I'm exploring the idea of the
horizon<00:05:07.350> line<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.880> horizon<00:05:09.450> line<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:10.050> derived

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
horizon line the horizon line is derived

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.000 
horizon line the horizon line is derived
from<00:05:10.830> connecting<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.970> two<00:05:12.180> vanishing<00:05:12.630> points

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
from connecting the two vanishing points

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.730 
from connecting the two vanishing points
with<00:05:14.010> your<00:05:14.190> ruler<00:05:14.660> boom<00:05:15.660> just<00:05:16.110> like<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.530> just

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
with your ruler boom just like that just

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.310 
with your ruler boom just like that just
connect<00:05:17.160> those<00:05:17.310> two<00:05:17.580> vanishing<00:05:17.970> points<00:05:18.320> and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
connect those two vanishing points and

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.950 
connect those two vanishing points and
whatever's<00:05:19.980> below<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.580> horizon<00:05:20.730> line<00:05:21.390> you're

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
whatever's below the horizon line you're

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.470 
whatever's below the horizon line you're
looking<00:05:21.990> down<00:05:22.620> at<00:05:22.920> it

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
looking down at it

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.060 
looking down at it
whatever's<00:05:24.480> above<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.110> horizon<00:05:25.290> line<00:05:25.800> you're

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
whatever's above the horizon line you're

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.760 
whatever's above the horizon line you're
gonna<00:05:26.220> be<00:05:26.400> looking<00:05:26.760> up<00:05:26.970> at<00:05:27.300> those<00:05:27.510> things<00:05:27.900> so

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
gonna be looking up at those things so

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.060 
gonna be looking up at those things so
that<00:05:28.920> has<00:05:29.220> two<00:05:29.760> houses<00:05:30.560> one<00:05:31.560> above<00:05:31.860> the

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
that has two houses one above the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.790 
that has two houses one above the
horizon<00:05:32.250> line<00:05:32.790> one<00:05:33.090> below<00:05:33.420> in<00:05:33.750> making<00:05:34.500> just

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
horizon line one below in making just

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.280 
horizon line one below in making just
copying<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.550> drawing<00:05:35.850> like<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.300> as<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:37.110> go

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
copying the drawing like that as I go

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.860 
copying the drawing like that as I go
through<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.620> step-by-step<00:05:38.390> it's<00:05:39.390> gonna<00:05:39.600> help

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
through it step-by-step it's gonna help

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.530 
through it step-by-step it's gonna help
you<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.110> understand<00:05:40.800> how<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.360> horizon<00:05:42.360> line

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
you to understand how the horizon line

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.570 
you to understand how the horizon line
functions<00:05:43.200> so<00:05:43.890> that's<00:05:44.100> going<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.370> be<00:05:44.490> an

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
functions so that's going to be an

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.240 
functions so that's going to be an
important<00:05:45.090> one<00:05:45.210> here<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.080> have<00:05:46.350> a<00:05:46.380> more<00:05:46.740> complex

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
important one here I have a more complex

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.600 
important one here I have a more complex
little<00:05:47.760> drawing<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.840> has<00:05:49.110> stairs<00:05:49.590> on<00:05:50.040> it<00:05:50.430> in

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
little drawing that has stairs on it in

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.390 
little drawing that has stairs on it in
depth<00:05:50.880> below<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.360> horizon<00:05:51.720> line<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:52.710> I'm

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
depth below the horizon line so I'm

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.830 
depth below the horizon line so I'm
going<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.670> talk<00:05:53.850> about<00:05:53.880> how<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.420> might<00:05:54.660> do

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
going to talk about how you might do

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.230 
going to talk about how you might do
something<00:05:55.110> like<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.670> then<00:05:56.670> I'm<00:05:56.820> gonna<00:05:57.030> try

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
something like that then I'm gonna try

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.590 
something like that then I'm gonna try
to<00:05:57.330> put<00:05:57.600> several<00:05:57.900> ideas<00:05:58.260> together<00:05:59.010> again<00:06:00.000> not

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
to put several ideas together again not

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.420 
to put several ideas together again not
the<00:06:00.780> best<00:06:00.990> drawing<00:06:01.320> but<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:02.010> gives<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.340> an

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
the best drawing but it gives you an

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.360
