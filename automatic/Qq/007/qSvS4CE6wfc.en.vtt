lesson<00:00:01.890> 41<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.669> adding<00:00:03.030> and

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
lesson 41 is about adding and

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.420 
lesson 41 is about adding and
subtracting<00:00:03.540> fractions<00:00:03.899> with<00:00:04.350> common

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
subtracting fractions with common

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.220 
subtracting fractions with common
denominators<00:00:05.430> before<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.870> lesson

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
denominators before you do this lesson

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.390 
denominators before you do this lesson
make<00:00:07.410> sure<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:07.919> completed

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
make sure you have completed

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.440 
make sure you have completed
investigation<00:00:09.330> number<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:11.150> now<00:00:12.150> let's<00:00:12.330> say

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
investigation number for now let's say

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.390 
investigation number for now let's say
you<00:00:12.509> had<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> fraction<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:14.000> one<00:00:15.000> third

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
you had a fraction like this one third

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.010 
you had a fraction like this one third
remember<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> top<00:00:17.760> part<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.420> fraction<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
remember the top part of the fraction is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.630 
remember the top part of the fraction is
called<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> numerator<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> bottom<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
called the numerator the bottom is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
called the numerator the bottom is
called<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> denominator<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> any<00:00:22.650> time<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
called the denominator and any time you

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
called the denominator and any time you
want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> add<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.970> subtract<00:00:24.449> fractions<00:00:24.750> they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
want to add or subtract fractions they

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.070 
want to add or subtract fractions they
have<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> common<00:00:26.340> denominator<00:00:26.840> or<00:00:27.840> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
have to have a common denominator or in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
have to have a common denominator or in
other<00:00:28.230> words<00:00:28.320> their<00:00:28.740> denominators<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
other words their denominators have to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.440 
other words their denominators have to
be<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> same<00:00:30.439> for<00:00:31.439> example<00:00:32.239> one-third<00:00:33.239> plus

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
be the same for example one-third plus

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.170 
be the same for example one-third plus
one<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.920> cannot<00:00:35.399> add<00:00:35.640> those<00:00:35.940> together

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
one for you cannot add those together

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
one for you cannot add those together
that<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.500> work<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.640> don't

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that will not work because they don't

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.060 
that will not work because they don't
have<00:00:38.940> common<00:00:39.540> denominators<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.680> don't<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
have common denominators they don't have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090 
have common denominators they don't have
the<00:00:41.640> same<00:00:41.969> denominator<00:00:42.930> that's<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.680> common

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the same denominator that's what common

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.979 
the same denominator that's what common
denominator<00:00:44.610> means<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.329> denominator

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
denominator means the same denominator

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
denominator means the same denominator
now<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> had<00:00:47.129> 13<00:00:48.350> plus<00:00:49.350> two-thirds<00:00:50.030> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
now if you had 13 plus two-thirds you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
now if you had 13 plus two-thirds you
could<00:00:51.270> add<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.750> together<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
could add that together and the way you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
could add that together and the way you
do<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.449> add<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.320> numbers

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
do that is you just add the two numbers

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
do that is you just add the two numbers
in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> numerator<00:00:56.120> one-third<00:00:57.120> plus

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in the numerator one-third plus

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
in the numerator one-third plus
two-thirds<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.399> three<00:00:59.399> thirds<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
two-thirds is three thirds and now just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.429 
two-thirds is three thirds and now just
think<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.829> fractions<00:01:02.539> one-third<00:01:03.539> let's

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think about fractions one-third let's

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.700 
think about fractions one-third let's
just<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
just think about how much that would be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
just think about how much that would be
we<00:01:07.710> drew<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> circle<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.479> about

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we drew a circle out that might be about

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.670 
we drew a circle out that might be about
one-third<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> two-thirds<00:01:12.680> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
one-third there and two-thirds that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
one-third there and two-thirds that
might<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.400> other<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
might be that other part it would be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830 
might be that other part it would be
that<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.530> part<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.210> combine<00:01:18.630> those

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that other part and so we combine those

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
that other part and so we combine those
together<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.790> whole<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:22.080> two<00:01:23.030> three

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
together to get one whole one two three

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
together to get one whole one two three
thirds<00:01:24.630> three<00:01:25.229> thirds<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> whole<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.340> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
thirds three thirds as a whole so that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.230 
thirds three thirds as a whole so that
equals<00:01:26.900> one<00:01:28.070> anytime<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> same

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
equals one anytime you have the same

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
equals one anytime you have the same
numerator<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> denominator<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
numerator as you do the denominator that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.999 
numerator as you do the denominator that
just<00:01:32.939> equals<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.409> something<00:01:34.860> real

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just equals one that's something real

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.050 
just equals one that's something real
important<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> try<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> remember<00:01:37.070> 2<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.520> 2<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
important to try to remember 2 over 2 is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.859 
important to try to remember 2 over 2 is
one<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.110> over<00:01:40.439> four<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> 18<00:01:41.790> thousand<00:01:42.659> over

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
one for over four is 18 thousand over

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
one for over four is 18 thousand over
8,000<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.070> anytime<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> same

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
8,000 is one anytime you have the same

numerator as denominator that just
equals<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:49.130> because<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.759> whole

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
equals one because you have one whole

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.499 
equals one because you have one whole
section<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.430> or<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:54.210> whole<00:01:54.479> item<00:01:56.509> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
section right or one whole item so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.440 
section right or one whole item so
anytime<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.140> add<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.680> subtract<00:01:59.130> fractions

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
anytime you add or subtract fractions

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.149 
anytime you add or subtract fractions
you<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.710> common

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
you just you have to have common

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.469 
you just you have to have common
denominators<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.759> both<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
denominators they both have to have the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.230 
denominators they both have to have the
same<00:02:03.659> denominator<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.579> then<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.969> add

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
same denominator and then you just add

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
same denominator and then you just add
the<00:02:06.899> numerators<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.590> subtract<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the numerators or subtract the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
the numerators or subtract the
numerators<00:02:08.849> from<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:09.270> other<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
numerators from each other the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.560 
numerators from each other the
denominator<00:02:10.649> does<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.160> change

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
denominator does not change

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
denominator does not change
hopefully<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:13.780> makes<00:02:13.930> sense<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.440> like

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
hopefully that makes sense to you like

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.770 
hopefully that makes sense to you like
this<00:02:14.710> problem<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.520> did<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.480> wouldn't

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
this problem we just did you wouldn't

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.230 
this problem we just did you wouldn't
add<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.860> two<00:02:18.070> denominators<00:02:18.280> three<00:02:18.970> plus

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
add the two denominators three plus

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.970 
add the two denominators three plus
three<00:02:19.270> because<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.530> would<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:20.710> ended

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
three because then you would have ended

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.180 
three because then you would have ended
up<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.330> 36<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.600> mean<00:02:23.320> we<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.590> clearly<00:02:23.890> see

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
up with 36 I mean we can clearly see

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.980 
up with 36 I mean we can clearly see
from<00:02:24.220> our<00:02:24.550> picture<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.570> helps<00:02:25.870> you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
from our picture and that helps you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.660 
from our picture and that helps you
understand<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.650> too<00:02:26.920> if<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.160> want<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.490> draw

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
understand this too if you want to draw

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.540 
understand this too if you want to draw
pictures<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.500> didn't<00:02:29.740> end<00:02:29.890> up<00:02:30.010> with<00:02:30.250> half

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
pictures that we didn't end up with half

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.430 
pictures that we didn't end up with half
of<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.240> circle<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:31.720> ended<00:02:31.960> up<00:02:32.020> with<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> whole

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
of a circle we ended up with a whole

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.500 
of a circle we ended up with a whole
circle<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.190> added<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.640> third<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.150> circle

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
circle when we added a third of a circle

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.130 
circle when we added a third of a circle
and<00:02:34.630> two-thirds<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.830> circle<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.960> when

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and two-thirds of the circle so when

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.480 
and two-thirds of the circle so when
you're<00:02:38.260> adding<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.740> subtracting<00:02:39.100> fractions

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
you're adding and subtracting fractions

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.730 
you're adding and subtracting fractions
not<00:02:40.390> only<00:02:40.600> do<00:02:40.780> they<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.260> common

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
not only do they have to have common

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.860 
not only do they have to have common
denominators<00:02:41.770> but<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.640> only<00:02:42.820> part<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.600> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
denominators but the only part that you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.900 
denominators but the only part that you
do<00:02:44.020> addition<00:02:44.410> or<00:02:44.500> subtraction<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.580> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
do addition or subtraction on is the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.710 
do addition or subtraction on is the
numerator<00:02:46.410> remember<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:48.720> start

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
numerator remember that start

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
numerator remember that start
remembering<00:02:50.170> now<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.710> different<00:02:51.250> for

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
remembering now that it's different for

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.170 
remembering now that it's different for
multiplication<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.670> when<00:02:54.850> you're<00:02:54.970> adding

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
multiplication but when you're adding

and subtracting fractions the only
number<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.760> changes<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:59.020> numerator

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
number that changes is the numerator

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.120 
number that changes is the numerator
part<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:01.510> only<00:03:01.720> add<00:03:01.960> or<00:03:02.170> subtract<00:03:02.530> numerators

the denominator stays the same let's do
a<00:03:05.830> couple<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.220> practice<00:03:06.580> problems<00:03:07.030> now<00:03:07.240> i<00:03:08.370> know

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
a couple of practice problems now i know

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.620 
a couple of practice problems now i know
i've<00:03:09.490> probably<00:03:09.640> said<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.180> hundred<00:03:10.420> times

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
i've probably said this a hundred times

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.480 
i've probably said this a hundred times
now<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.230> i<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.620> want<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.040> understand

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
now but i just want you to understand

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.850 
now but i just want you to understand
this<00:03:12.610> if<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.880> remember<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:14.560> it'll

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
this if you remember this now then it'll

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.370 
this if you remember this now then it'll
eliminate<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.460> whole<00:03:15.790> lot<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.060> mistakes<00:03:16.380> you'll

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
eliminate a whole lot of mistakes you'll

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.130 
eliminate a whole lot of mistakes you'll
add<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.740> subtract<00:03:18.070> fractions<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.960> rest

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
add and subtract fractions for the rest

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.370 
add and subtract fractions for the rest
of<00:03:20.230> your<00:03:20.410> schooling<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.690> rest<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.020> your<00:03:23.140> life

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
of your schooling the rest of your life

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.440 
of your schooling the rest of your life
too<00:03:23.800> you'll<00:03:24.160> always<00:03:24.370> be<00:03:24.520> doing<00:03:24.970> things<00:03:25.240> where

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
too you'll always be doing things where

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.640 
too you'll always be doing things where
you<00:03:25.540> need<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.750> add<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.080> subtract<00:03:26.410> fractions

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
you need to add and subtract fractions

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.310 
you need to add and subtract fractions
you<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:28.030> common<00:03:28.780> denominators<00:03:28.810> so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
you have to have common denominators so

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.110 
you have to have common denominators so
in<00:03:29.530> practice<00:03:29.860> problem<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.280> we<00:03:30.490> do<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:30.880> have<00:03:31.090> a

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
in practice problem a we do we have a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.690 
in practice problem a we do we have a
five<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:32.170> both<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.560> those<00:03:32.680> denominators<00:03:33.340> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
five for both of those denominators and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.550 
five for both of those denominators and
so<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.000> just<00:03:34.030> add<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.600> numerators<00:03:35.080> one<00:03:35.320> plus

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
so we just add the numerators one plus

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.390 
so we just add the numerators one plus
three<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.830> four<00:03:36.280> over<00:03:37.030> five<00:03:37.860> four<00:03:38.860> fifths<00:03:41.400> if

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
three is four over five four fifths if

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400 
three is four over five four fifths if
we<00:03:42.550> wanted<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.910> we<00:03:43.030> could<00:03:43.240> make<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.570> picture<00:03:44.080> to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
we wanted to we could make a picture to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.980 
we wanted to we could make a picture to
help<00:03:44.560> us<00:03:44.830> let's<00:03:45.430> make<00:03:45.670> some<00:03:45.910> rectangles<00:03:48.990> five

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
help us let's make some rectangles five

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.360 
help us let's make some rectangles five
rectangles<00:03:50.670> one<00:03:51.670> fifth<00:03:52.330> one<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.890> those<00:03:54.040> five

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
rectangles one fifth one of those five

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.190 
rectangles one fifth one of those five
we<00:03:54.970> can<00:03:55.120> shade<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.840> then<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.020> add

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
we can shade that in and then we add

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.180 
we can shade that in and then we add
three<00:03:57.130> more<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.000> five<00:03:58.270> so<00:03:58.900> we<00:03:58.930> do<00:03:59.260> one<00:03:59.530> two

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
three more of the five so we do one two

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.640 
three more of the five so we do one two
three<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.210> see<00:04:01.390> now<00:04:01.570> four<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.230> five<00:04:02.410> are

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
three and see now four of the five are

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.100 
three and see now four of the five are
shaded<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.160> our<00:04:03.250> answer<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.580> four<00:04:04.000> fifths

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
shaded so our answer is four fifths

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.390 
shaded so our answer is four fifths
look<00:04:07.110> at<00:04:07.260> B<00:04:07.410> we<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> subtraction<00:04:07.980> problem

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
look at B we have a subtraction problem

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.750 
look at B we have a subtraction problem
here<00:04:08.879> six<00:04:09.209> seven<00:04:09.569> minus<00:04:10.170> three<00:04:10.319> sevens<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.580> we

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
here six seven minus three sevens so we

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.900 
here six seven minus three sevens so we
do<00:04:11.910> six<00:04:12.269> minus<00:04:12.599> three<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.200> three<00:04:14.190> our

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
do six minus three is three our

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.590 
do six minus three is three our
denominator<00:04:15.569> stays<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:16.200> same<00:04:17.150> three<00:04:18.150> sevens

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
denominator stays the same three sevens

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.710 
denominator stays the same three sevens
we<00:04:19.470> took<00:04:19.650> three<00:04:19.889> sevens<00:04:20.340> from<00:04:20.549> 67<00:04:21.239> s<00:04:21.329> we'd<00:04:21.510> end

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
we took three sevens from 67 s we'd end

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.640 
we took three sevens from 67 s we'd end
up<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:22.079> three<00:04:22.560> sevens<00:04:24.410> look<00:04:25.410> at<00:04:25.530> practice

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
up with three sevens look at practice

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.890 
up with three sevens look at practice
problem<00:04:26.130> see<00:04:26.370> now<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.940> two<00:04:27.479> mixed

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
problem see now we have two mixed

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.110 
problem see now we have two mixed
numbers<00:04:28.229> that<00:04:28.410> we're<00:04:28.530> adding<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.060> here's<00:04:30.060> a

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
numbers that we're adding and here's a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.850 
numbers that we're adding and here's a
hint<00:04:30.360> when<00:04:30.600> you're<00:04:30.750> adding<00:04:30.930> mixed<00:04:31.320> numbers<00:04:31.680> or

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
hint when you're adding mixed numbers or

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.159 
hint when you're adding mixed numbers or
subtracting<00:04:32.430> them<00:04:32.550> do<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.479> whole<00:04:33.840> number

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
subtracting them do the whole number

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.469 
subtracting them do the whole number
part<00:04:34.440> separately<00:04:35.220> from<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.850> fraction<00:04:36.450> part

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
part separately from the fraction part

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.960 
part separately from the fraction part
so<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:37.500> let's<00:04:38.040> look<00:04:38.160> at<00:04:38.310> our<00:04:38.370> whole<00:04:38.639> number

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
so we let's look at our whole number

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.820 
so we let's look at our whole number
part<00:04:39.270> for<00:04:39.479> both<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.780> these<00:04:39.870> we<00:04:40.050> have<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.229> two<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
part for both of these we have a two and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.800 
part for both of these we have a two and
A<00:04:41.310> two<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.820> add<00:04:41.940> together<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.570> would<00:04:42.780> be

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
A two to add together so that would be

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.950 
A two to add together so that would be
four<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.620> then<00:04:44.520> we<00:04:44.669> have<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> two<00:04:45.150> thirds<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.750> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
four and then we have a two thirds and a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.379 
four and then we have a two thirds and a
13<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.830> add<00:04:46.950> together<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.940> we<00:04:48.090> can<00:04:48.240> say

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
13 to add together and so we can say

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.159 
13 to add together and so we can say
plus<00:04:48.979> three<00:04:49.979> thirds<00:04:50.419> now<00:04:51.419> we<00:04:51.479> just<00:04:51.750> said<00:04:51.930> that

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
plus three thirds now we just said that

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.200 
plus three thirds now we just said that
any<00:04:52.440> time<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.919> numerator<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.700> denominator

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
any time the numerator and denominator

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.610 
any time the numerator and denominator
are<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.510> same<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> same<00:04:55.290> thing<00:04:55.320> as

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
are the same that's the same thing as

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.219 
are the same that's the same thing as
saying<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.669> whole<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.120> have<00:04:57.270> all<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.810> parts

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
saying one whole you have all the parts

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.360 
saying one whole you have all the parts
shaded<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.900> equals<00:05:01.139> one<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.889> so

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
shaded in and that equals one and so

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.550 
shaded in and that equals one and so
we're<00:05:02.970> really<00:05:03.120> doing<00:05:03.330> four<00:05:03.720> plus<00:05:03.960> one<00:05:04.110> which

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
we're really doing four plus one which

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.600 
we're really doing four plus one which
is<00:05:05.550> five<00:05:06.350> so<00:05:07.350> two<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.740> two<00:05:07.889> thirds<00:05:08.130> plus<00:05:08.370> two

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
is five so two and two thirds plus two

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
is five so two and two thirds plus two
and<00:05:08.729> one-third<00:05:08.970> equals<00:05:09.510> five<00:05:11.240> let's<00:05:12.240> do<00:05:12.419> one

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
and one-third equals five let's do one

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.230 
and one-third equals five let's do one
more<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.200> subtraction<00:05:13.770> problem<00:05:13.979> 9<00:05:14.880> and

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
more this is a subtraction problem 9 and

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.140 
more this is a subtraction problem 9 and
18<00:05:15.479> s<00:05:15.810> minus<00:05:16.020> 3<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.410> 18<00:05:16.710> again<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:17.760> do<00:05:17.970> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
18 s minus 3 and 18 again we do the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.730 
18 s minus 3 and 18 again we do the
whole<00:05:18.450> number<00:05:18.750> part<00:05:18.990> separate<00:05:19.470> from<00:05:19.620> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
whole number part separate from the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.790 
whole number part separate from the
fraction<00:05:20.190> parts<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.180> 9<00:05:21.539> minus<00:05:21.810> three<00:05:22.260> is<00:05:22.289> six

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
fraction parts so 9 minus three is six

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.070 
fraction parts so 9 minus three is six
and<00:05:23.300> then<00:05:24.410> 18<00:05:25.410> minus<00:05:26.250> 18<00:05:27.120> well<00:05:27.419> we're<00:05:27.630> doing<00:05:27.720> 1

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
and then 18 minus 18 well we're doing 1

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.270 
and then 18 minus 18 well we're doing 1
minus<00:05:28.320> 1<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.800> 0<00:05:29.070> 0<00:05:29.580> /<00:05:29.910> 8<00:05:30.090> is<00:05:30.270> just<00:05:30.510> 0<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.410> so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
minus 1 and 0 0 / 8 is just 0 and so

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.800 
minus 1 and 0 0 / 8 is just 0 and so
that's<00:05:32.490> our<00:05:32.700> answer<00:05:32.880> 6<00:05:35.419> let's<00:05:36.419> do<00:05:36.570> one<00:05:36.780> more

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
that's our answer 6 let's do one more

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.960 
that's our answer 6 let's do one more
subtraction<00:05:37.590> problem<00:05:37.979> four<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.760> five

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
subtraction problem four and five

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.779 
subtraction problem four and five
eighths<00:05:39.180> minus<00:05:39.630> 2<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:39.990> 18<00:05:40.289> okay<00:05:41.250> so<00:05:41.310> we<00:05:41.550> do<00:05:41.669> our

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
eighths minus 2 and 18 okay so we do our

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.610 
eighths minus 2 and 18 okay so we do our
whole<00:05:42.000> number<00:05:42.270> parts<00:05:42.570> separate<00:05:43.110> so<00:05:43.380> we<00:05:43.500> do

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
whole number parts separate so we do

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.190 
whole number parts separate so we do
four<00:05:43.889> minus<00:05:44.100> two<00:05:44.220> is<00:05:44.400> two<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:45.150> then<00:05:45.870> we<00:05:46.050> do

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
four minus two is two and then we do

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.360 
four minus two is two and then we do
five<00:05:46.560> eight<00:05:46.830> minus<00:05:47.460> 18<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.330> we<00:05:49.320> add<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:49.919> to

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
five eight minus 18 and we add that to

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.180 
five eight minus 18 and we add that to
the<00:05:50.520> two<00:05:50.700> we<00:05:50.910> don't<00:05:51.060> say<00:05:51.620> 2-4<00:05:52.620> eights<00:05:52.889> it's

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
the two we don't say 2-4 eights it's

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.710 
the two we don't say 2-4 eights it's
just<00:05:53.400> two<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:56.340> four<00:05:56.610> eights<00:05:56.789> part<00:05:57.150> so<00:05:57.389> we

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
just two and the four eights part so we

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.240 
just two and the four eights part so we
always<00:05:57.900> think<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.380> mixed<00:05:58.680> numbers<00:05:58.950> we<00:05:59.070> think

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
always think of mixed numbers we think

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.700 
always think of mixed numbers we think
of<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.430> whole<00:05:59.580> number<00:05:59.880> part<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.710> the

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
of the whole number part and the

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.140 
of the whole number part and the
fraction<00:06:02.160> part<00:06:02.190> we<00:06:02.460> always<00:06:02.669> use<00:06:02.789> that<00:06:02.820> word

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
fraction part we always use that word

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.290 
fraction part we always use that word
and<00:06:03.479> in<00:06:03.690> there<00:06:03.900> and<00:06:04.110> so<00:06:04.680> we<00:06:04.800> have<00:06:04.950> four<00:06:05.370> minus

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
and in there and so we have four minus

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.600 
and in there and so we have four minus
two<00:06:06.450> is<00:06:06.660> two<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:07.380> then<00:06:07.830> we<00:06:07.919> do<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.190> fraction

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
two is two and then we do the fraction

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.580 
two is two and then we do the fraction
part<00:06:08.639> 5<00:06:09.090> 8<00:06:09.330> minus<00:06:09.930> 18<00:06:10.500> is<00:06:10.700> 482<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:12.500> 48

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.560 

okay<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:16.650> i'll<00:06:16.830> say<00:06:17.010> this<00:06:17.040> one<00:06:17.490> more<00:06:17.520> time<00:06:17.940> when

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
okay so i'll say this one more time when

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.060 
okay so i'll say this one more time when
you're<00:06:18.720> adding<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.260> subtracting<00:06:19.680> fractions

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
you're adding and subtracting fractions

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.150 
you're adding and subtracting fractions
you<00:06:21.000> add<00:06:21.240> or<00:06:21.600> subtract<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.170> numerators<00:06:22.710> you

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
you add or subtract the numerators you

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.310 
you add or subtract the numerators you
have<00:06:23.400> to<00:06:23.550> have<00:06:23.700> common<00:06:24.270> denominators<00:06:24.420> they

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
have to have common denominators they

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.460 
have to have common denominators they
both<00:06:25.500> have<00:06:25.710> to<00:06:25.860> be<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.520> same<00:06:26.690> number<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.900> you

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
both have to be the same number and you

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.500 
both have to be the same number and you
don't<00:06:28.650> add<00:06:28.980> or<00:06:29.430> subtract<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.940> denominators

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
don't add or subtract the denominators

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.700 
don't add or subtract the denominators
you<00:06:30.570> just<00:06:30.750> leave<00:06:30.930> it<00:06:30.960> as<00:06:31.200> it<00:06:31.680> is<00:06:33.530> okay<00:06:34.530> well

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
you just leave it as it is okay well

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.150 
you just leave it as it is okay well
that's<00:06:34.860> all<00:06:35.070> for<00:06:35.310> lesson<00:06:35.670> 41
