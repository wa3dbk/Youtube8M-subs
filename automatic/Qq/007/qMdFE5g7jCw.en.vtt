and stairs like I did on the video now
it's<00:01:38.820> time<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> fast<00:01:39.689> car<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.200> example

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it's time to get a fast car for example

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's time to get a fast car for example
I<00:01:40.740> used<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.159> Jericho<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.790> nitro<00:01:42.210> Vegas<00:01:43.170> can

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
I used to Jericho with nitro Vegas can

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.850 
I used to Jericho with nitro Vegas can
do<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
do it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
do it
also<00:01:44.430> without<00:01:44.670> nitro<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> bit

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
also without nitro but it's a bit

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
also without nitro but it's a bit
trickier<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.590> can't<00:01:46.799> steer

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
trickier because you can't steer

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
trickier because you can't steer
now<00:01:48.119> before<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> hit<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> stairs<00:01:49.020> make<00:01:49.290> sure

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
now before you hit the stairs make sure

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.840 
now before you hit the stairs make sure
the<00:01:49.619> nitro<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.009> activated<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.640> when<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the nitro is activated and when you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
the nitro is activated and when you
almost<00:01:51.210> hit<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> car<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> stash<00:01:52.140> stair

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
almost hit the car on the stash stair

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130
