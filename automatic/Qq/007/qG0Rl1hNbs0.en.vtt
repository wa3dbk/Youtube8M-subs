00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
 we will see 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 and 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.500
 what a pink wave as strange about the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.270
 blue cousin and good hope I 'm very well 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 this time I have a small 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.660
 video where I want to show you the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.189
 possible problems that you can have at 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 time to install what you are doing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.419
 on your pc and good is the most 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.189
 simple to solve it so good 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.410
 form a lot of attention please the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.160
 first error is about installing or 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.540
 to play 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.279
 rockstar as it warns that we could 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.680
 receive an error message when 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.720
 install or play with gta 5 which we 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.130
 would say the following message the service 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.530
 update to the rice but it's 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.390
 available code 1 or directly see 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 how the game stays then trying 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 download what the update without 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.150
 to see progress in the process in this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.710
 case the Americans who warn us that 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.390
 the error could be in the name of the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 administrator user since the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 only things that are allowed then 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.050
 would be the name with the letters of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.750
 the z and make lowercase and uppercase or 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.880
 some number from 0 to 9 and the things that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.129
 are not allowed would be for example the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.530
 at the sign of the cat or the sign of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 exclamation if your name contains 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
 some of these characters you will have a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.319
 problem when installing what is the game 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.310
 but good rock is telling us that it is 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.320
 working 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.000
 to correct it but if we do not want 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 wait for it to be published because we will have 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.299
 that create what is another beacon with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.039
 administrator privileges on the pc and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.930
 so put a name that respects the 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.310
 characters that are compatible for 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.380
 do it with refer them to several link 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.119
 of which I am going to the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 that in the bottom part one corresponds 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.399
 to windows 8.1 another to windows 7 and the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 last to windows seen ok so there 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.479
 can enter to dry how 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.640
 solve the problem of what is the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.560
 name now we continue with errors in the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.509
 social club here we enter another 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.979
 ground because they are several and different 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 the error messages that we can see 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 for example the first one is about then 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 The social cloud has failed to start 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 the second social cloud has not been able 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 charged for an incomplete installation 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.819
 please exit the game and reinstall 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.860
 what is the social cloud version or 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.689
 the third one needs a more version 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.159
 recent is to use it for the update 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.409
 has failed please exit the game and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.479
 register in the social club version 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.099
 if we have any of these problems what 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 first thing to check is that gta 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.880
 5 is not running in the background 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.220
 for that we have to go to manager 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.519
 windows tasks and search gta 5 point 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 xxi play gta 5 point exe or gta 5 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.640
 launcher point 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 that are not open once checked 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.390
 that are not working 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.890
 none of them because rockstar asks us 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 that we follow some simple steps that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.280
 specify what your support page 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.450
 which I will leave to the party 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 from below that will bring a man who 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.470
 says errors in the social cloud so 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.880
 they give you a click and it will take you to the page 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.430
 and there they will follow the steps to 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.740
 solve that problem now we continue 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.290
 with the problem you do not have windows media 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.300
 player if you're not very friendly then this 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.430
 Microsoft application you should know 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.560
 who could receive what is a message 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 of gta 5 since it is necessary to have 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 installed on windows so this game 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.140
 work is more the installer itself 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.270
 will warn with a message that says 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.570
 impossible to find windows media player 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.090
 in your system so you're going to have 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.500
 that go to what the microsoft page and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 download what the windows media player 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.310
 and good to reinstall what is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.200
 of the game the truth as there are many 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.180
 battles here many problems with what 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.680
 what is the game so if you have 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.510
 some of these little problems well 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.060
 these are some solutions if they go 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.709
 leaving more things out of mistakes and car 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.150
 chain and media box and all that I'm going to 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.400
 go warning all module make a small 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.930
 video so stay tuned I hope 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.670
 very much that they share what is this 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.129
 I would really like to really get to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.650
 the 300 like so if you can me 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.939
 would make happy memories but they are 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.349
 social networks and the channel for more 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.120
 videos if you have any doubt or something 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.099
 simply as well as they comment already know 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.569
 either around here for the video or 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.849

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.799
