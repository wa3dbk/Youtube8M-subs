a<00:05:16.030> lot<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.420> people<00:05:16.690> when<00:05:16.930> they<00:05:16.960> first<00:05:17.050> start

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
a lot of people when they first start

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.810 
a lot of people when they first start
losing<00:05:17.650> weight<00:05:17.830> they<00:05:18.070> get<00:05:18.190> kind<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.460> confused

losing weight they get kind of confused

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.970 
losing weight they get kind of confused
I<00:05:18.970> was<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.570> same<00:05:19.750> exact<00:05:20.080> way<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:20.590> think<00:05:20.770> I

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
I was the same exact way you think I

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.530 
I was the same exact way you think I
need<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.460> cardio<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:21.940> burn<00:05:21.970> more<00:05:22.300> calories

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
need you to cardio to burn more calories

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.870 
need you to cardio to burn more calories
which<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.740> turn<00:05:23.980> means<00:05:24.130> I'm<00:05:24.310> gonna<00:05:24.460> lose<00:05:24.670> more

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
which in turn means I'm gonna lose more

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.210 
which in turn means I'm gonna lose more
fat<00:05:25.090> but<00:05:25.690> it's<00:05:25.840> really<00:05:26.230> kind<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:26.740> not<00:05:26.920> exactly

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
fat but it's really kind of not exactly

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.880 
fat but it's really kind of not exactly
like<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.870> honestly<00:05:28.870> what<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.140> believe<00:05:29.530> is<00:05:29.740> a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
like that honestly what I believe is a

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.720 
like that honestly what I believe is a
good<00:05:30.250> split<00:05:30.700> between<00:05:30.940> cardio<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:32.730> weight

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
good split between cardio and weight

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.730 
good split between cardio and weight
training<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.270> gonna<00:05:34.690> be<00:05:34.810> 80%<00:05:35.080> weight<00:05:35.470> training

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
training is gonna be 80% weight training

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.310 
training is gonna be 80% weight training
about<00:05:36.160> 20%<00:05:36.760> cardio<00:05:37.060> it's<00:05:37.480> what<00:05:37.690> I<00:05:37.720> do<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.200> it's

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
about 20% cardio it's what I do and it's

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.320 
about 20% cardio it's what I do and it's
what<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.770> works<00:05:39.160> really<00:05:39.460> really<00:05:39.610> well<00:05:39.880> for<00:05:40.060> me

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
what it works really really well for me

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.680 
what it works really really well for me
the<00:05:40.840> more<00:05:41.080> muscle<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.950> you<00:05:42.280> build<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:43.390> more

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
the more muscle that you build the more

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.600 
the more muscle that you build the more
calories<00:05:43.930> you<00:05:44.260> will<00:05:44.380> burn<00:05:44.590> just<00:05:45.190> standing

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
calories you will burn just standing

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.370 
calories you will burn just standing
around<00:05:45.700> because<00:05:46.240> basically<00:05:46.660> losing<00:05:47.110> weight

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
around because basically losing weight

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.070 
around because basically losing weight
it's<00:05:47.590> it's<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:48.040> simple<00:05:48.520> equation<00:05:49.150> right<00:05:49.840> it's

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
it's it's a simple equation right it's

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.560 
it's it's a simple equation right it's
you<00:05:50.560> have<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.800> be<00:05:50.920> at<00:05:51.040> a<00:05:51.070> caloric<00:05:51.550> deficit<00:05:52.030> to

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
you have to be at a caloric deficit to

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.350 
you have to be at a caloric deficit to
lose<00:05:53.230> weight<00:05:53.470> so<00:05:53.860> if<00:05:54.160> you<00:05:54.520> have<00:05:54.670> more<00:05:54.910> muscle

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
lose weight so if you have more muscle

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.510 
lose weight so if you have more muscle
you<00:05:55.600> are<00:05:55.900> burning<00:05:56.110> more<00:05:56.740> calories<00:05:57.190> throughout

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
you are burning more calories throughout

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.330 
you are burning more calories throughout
the<00:05:57.850> day<00:05:57.910> doing<00:05:58.510> nothing<00:05:59.080> just<00:05:59.380> standing

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
the day doing nothing just standing

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.590 
the day doing nothing just standing
around<00:06:00.430> you're<00:06:00.730> gonna<00:06:00.820> burn<00:06:01.030> more<00:06:01.360> calories

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
around you're gonna burn more calories

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.480 
around you're gonna burn more calories
than<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.170> would<00:06:02.320> have<00:06:02.440> if<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.740> wouldn't<00:06:03.250> have

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
than you would have if you wouldn't have

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.600 
than you would have if you wouldn't have

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
gained the muscle so that means you can

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.070 
gained the muscle so that means you can
eat<00:06:06.820> more<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.360> that<00:06:07.690> means<00:06:07.870> you're<00:06:07.990> gonna
