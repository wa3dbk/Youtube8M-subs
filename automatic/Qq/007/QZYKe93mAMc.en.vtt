we
let<00:00:11.630> me<00:00:11.780> show<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:12.170> a<00:00:12.260> little<00:00:12.320> video<00:00:12.620> of<00:00:12.770> a

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
let me show you a little video of a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.900 
let me show you a little video of a
little<00:00:13.010> suspension<00:00:13.970> mod<00:00:14.440> now<00:00:15.610> being<00:00:16.610> there's

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
little suspension mod now being there's

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.460 
little suspension mod now being there's
no<00:00:17.950> clips<00:00:18.950> available<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.850> add<00:00:20.150> preload<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:21.350> the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
no clips available to add preload to the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.300 
no clips available to add preload to the
springs<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:23.380> don't<00:00:24.380> have<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.710> tools<00:00:24.920> to<00:00:25.040> make

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
springs and don't have the tools to make

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.529 
springs and don't have the tools to make
any<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.900> thought<00:00:26.900> what<00:00:27.650> about<00:00:27.920> zip<00:00:28.190> ties<00:00:28.539> zip

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
any I thought what about zip ties zip

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.900 
any I thought what about zip ties zip
tie<00:00:29.780> should<00:00:29.840> work<00:00:30.289> right<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.340> know<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.730> got

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
tie should work right you know they got

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.970 
tie should work right you know they got
some<00:00:31.940> thickness<00:00:32.330> so<00:00:32.629> you<00:00:32.720> get<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.050> white<00:00:33.620> zip

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
some thickness so you get the white zip

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.460 
some thickness so you get the white zip
ties<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:34.580> there's<00:00:35.030> wider<00:00:35.239> zip<00:00:35.540> ties<00:00:35.720> too<00:00:36.050> so

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
ties and there's wider zip ties too so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.170 
ties and there's wider zip ties too so
you've<00:00:36.739> got<00:00:36.890> quite<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.220> bit<00:00:37.400> of<00:00:37.520> room<00:00:37.699> here<00:00:37.970> to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
you've got quite a bit of room here to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.350 
you've got quite a bit of room here to
you<00:00:38.989> know<00:00:39.020> beef<00:00:39.650> them<00:00:39.890> up<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.160> little<00:00:40.309> what<00:00:41.239> it's

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
you know beef them up a little what it's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.030 
you know beef them up a little what it's
doing<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.050> more<00:00:42.199> it'll<00:00:42.650> make<00:00:42.860> your

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
doing is that you more it'll make your

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.360 
doing is that you more it'll make your
suspension<00:00:43.729> stiffer<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:44.900> this<00:00:45.080> thing

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
suspension stiffer because this thing

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.860 
suspension stiffer because this thing
factory<00:00:46.370> setup<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.790> pretty<00:00:46.940> soft<00:00:47.300> in<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.659> rear

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
factory setup is pretty soft in the rear

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.600 
factory setup is pretty soft in the rear
because<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.860> got<00:00:48.979> a<00:00:49.010> lot<00:00:49.159> of<00:00:49.190> weight<00:00:49.400> back

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
because you got a lot of weight back

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.910 
because you got a lot of weight back
here<00:00:49.909> with<00:00:50.030> your<00:00:50.180> motor<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.540> everything<00:00:50.930> but

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
here with your motor and everything but

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.750 
here with your motor and everything but
now<00:00:52.720> I've<00:00:53.720> got<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.260> lot<00:00:54.559> better<00:00:54.949> response<00:00:55.519> into

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
now I've got a lot better response into

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.719 
now I've got a lot better response into
my<00:00:55.940> rear<00:00:56.540> suspension<00:00:57.229> and<00:00:57.409> it's<00:00:58.159> stiffer<00:00:58.430> just

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
my rear suspension and it's stiffer just

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.369 
my rear suspension and it's stiffer just
by<00:00:58.850> adding<00:00:59.150> in<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.360> couple<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.720> zip<00:00:59.870> ties<00:01:00.140> so

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
by adding in a couple of zip ties so

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:12.760 
by adding in a couple of zip ties so
I'll<00:01:00.470> give<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.769> close-up<00:01:01.309> view<00:01:01.729> of<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:11.770> so

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
I'll give you a close-up view of that so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.640 
I'll give you a close-up view of that so
I<00:01:12.799> just<00:01:12.890> put<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.220> zip<00:01:13.520> tie<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:14.119> each<00:01:14.510> side<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.560> you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
I just put a zip tie on each side so you

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.020 
I just put a zip tie on each side so you
gotta<00:01:15.800> pull<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.130> collar<00:01:16.340> down<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
gotta pull the collar down with the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.510 
gotta pull the collar down with the
spring<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.630> spring<00:01:18.050> stays<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.710> behind<00:01:19.250> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
spring so the spring stays in behind and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.630 
spring so the spring stays in behind and
then<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.930> make<00:01:21.140> some<00:01:21.320> space<00:01:21.560> pop<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.460> zip

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
then just make some space pop in a zip

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.870 
then just make some space pop in a zip
tie<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.020> voila<00:01:24.020> instant<00:01:24.890> suspension<00:01:25.490> booster

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
tie and voila instant suspension booster

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.430 
tie and voila instant suspension booster
so<00:01:27.070> it's<00:01:28.070> not<00:01:28.220> going<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.460> make<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.790> any<00:01:28.940> higher

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
so it's not going to make you any higher

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.350 
so it's not going to make you any higher
but<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.890> gonna<00:01:31.130> make<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.550> stiffer<00:01:32.030> because

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
but it is gonna make it stiffer because

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.570 
but it is gonna make it stiffer because
it's<00:01:32.510> adding<00:01:32.750> some<00:01:33.050> preload<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.460> the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's adding some preload on to the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.340 
it's adding some preload on to the
springs<00:01:34.940> while<00:01:35.180> maintaining<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.140> same

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
springs while maintaining the same

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.770 
springs while maintaining the same
height<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.820> gives<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.330> stiffer

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
height so this gives you a stiffer

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.840 
height so this gives you a stiffer
suspension<00:01:38.900> in<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.440> rear<00:01:39.530> which<00:01:40.370> this<00:01:40.640> thing

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
suspension in the rear which this thing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.810 
suspension in the rear which this thing
really<00:01:41.090> does<00:01:41.450> need<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.490> can<00:01:43.640> make<00:01:43.790> a

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
really does need so and you can make a

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.020 
really does need so and you can make a
little<00:01:44.060> stiffer<00:01:44.540> yet<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:46.250> gonna<00:01:46.400> see<00:01:46.880> if<00:01:46.910> I

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
little stiffer yet so I'm gonna see if I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.670 
little stiffer yet so I'm gonna see if I
can<00:01:47.210> find<00:01:47.420> some<00:01:47.600> wider<00:01:47.840> zip<00:01:48.140> ties<00:01:48.380> at<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
can find some wider zip ties at the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.470 
can find some wider zip ties at the
store<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:50.920> see<00:01:51.920> about<00:01:52.070> maybe<00:01:52.850> doubling<00:01:53.450> that

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
store and see about maybe doubling that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.110 
store and see about maybe doubling that
and<00:01:53.930> seeing<00:01:54.830> if<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.070> stiffens<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.670> up<00:01:55.790> enough

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
and seeing if that stiffens it up enough

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.850 
and seeing if that stiffens it up enough
because<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.450> would<00:01:56.540> be<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.690> lot<00:01:56.930> better<00:01:57.140> for<00:01:57.530> for

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
because it would be a lot better for for

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.490 
because it would be a lot better for for
jumping<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.550> running<00:01:58.909> everything<00:01:59.470> with<00:02:00.470> a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
jumping for running everything with a

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.890 
jumping for running everything with a
stiffer<00:02:00.830> rear<00:02:01.070> end<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.820> front<00:02:02.090> suspension<00:02:02.690> is

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
stiffer rear end the front suspension is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.710 
stiffer rear end the front suspension is
it<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.680> soft<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.730> think<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:05.300> pretty<00:02:05.480> good

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it is soft but I think it's pretty good

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.550 
it is soft but I think it's pretty good
the<00:02:05.870> way<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.880> maybe<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:08.000> real<00:02:08.840> narrow<00:02:09.229> zip

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the way it is maybe a real narrow zip

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040 
the way it is maybe a real narrow zip
tie<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.729> little<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.629> of<00:02:11.750> extra

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
tie in here just a little bit of extra

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.479 
tie in here just a little bit of extra
beef<00:02:12.940> would<00:02:13.940> actually<00:02:14.709> help<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.769> out<00:02:15.950> for

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
beef would actually help that out for

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.250 
beef would actually help that out for
you<00:02:16.790> know<00:02:16.909> just<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.269> little<00:02:17.360> bit<00:02:17.629> less<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
you know just a little bit less on the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
you know just a little bit less on the
the<00:02:19.099> softness<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.549> be<00:02:22.700> aware<00:02:22.969> that

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
the softness and but just be aware that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.580 
the softness and but just be aware that
every<00:02:23.299> time<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.749> do<00:02:23.900> something<00:02:24.079> with<00:02:24.379> you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
every time you do something with you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.500 
every time you do something with you
suspension<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.250> stiffen<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:25.879> or<00:02:26.090> loosen<00:02:26.120> it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
suspension to stiffen it up or loosen it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.680 
suspension to stiffen it up or loosen it
up<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.349> are<00:02:27.379> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.340> create<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> different

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
up you are going to create a different

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.420 
up you are going to create a different
character<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.379> how<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.190> car<00:02:32.060> performs<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:34.220> by

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
character and how the car performs so by

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.729 
character and how the car performs so by
stiffening<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> rear<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:36.470> know<00:02:36.560> we're

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
stiffening up the rear you know we're

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.990 
stiffening up the rear you know we're
going<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.010> get<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.459> know<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> little<00:02:37.670> bit

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to get you know a little bit

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.199 
going to get you know a little bit
probably<00:02:38.900> less<00:02:39.260> traction<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.910> sand

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
probably less traction on the sand

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.809 
probably less traction on the sand
especially<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.769> in<00:02:42.920> our<00:02:43.069> cornering<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.640> going

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
especially and in our cornering is going

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.809 
especially and in our cornering is going
to<00:02:43.879> be<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.209> stiffer<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:44.840> too<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> things

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
to be a little stiffer now too so things

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.479 
to be a little stiffer now too so things
are<00:02:46.970> going<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.150> change<00:02:47.260> characteristically

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
are going to change characteristically

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.190 
are going to change characteristically
if<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.640> stiffen<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.150> front<00:02:50.420> suspension<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
if we stiffen up the front suspension a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.170 
if we stiffen up the front suspension a
bit<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:52.040> know<00:02:52.129> we're<00:02:52.310> gonna<00:02:52.400> change<00:02:52.790> again

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
bit you know we're gonna change again

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.720 
bit you know we're gonna change again
you<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.049> things<00:02:54.530> about<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.010> car<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.400> how<00:02:55.519> it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
you know things about the car and how it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.819 
you know things about the car and how it
handles<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:56.900> these<00:02:57.290> things<00:02:57.530> could<00:02:57.769> be

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
handles but these things could be

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.509 
handles but these things could be
improving<00:02:58.579> or<00:02:59.019> could<00:03:00.019> be<00:03:00.290> going<00:03:01.250> backwards

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
improving or could be going backwards

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.309 
improving or could be going backwards
but<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:02.900> you're<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> go

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
but I don't think you're going to go

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.770 
but I don't think you're going to go
backwards<00:03:03.650> anywhere<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.790> stiffening<00:03:05.480> up<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
backwards anywhere and stiffening up the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.270 
backwards anywhere and stiffening up the
rear<00:03:05.989> suspension<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.650> bit<00:03:06.799> because<00:03:07.040> it

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
rear suspension a bit because it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.930 
rear suspension a bit because it
actually<00:03:07.549> really<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.660> too<00:03:09.170> soft<00:03:09.790> from<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
actually really is too soft from the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.440 
actually really is too soft from the
factory<00:03:11.480> I'm<00:03:12.319> also<00:03:12.470> going<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.739> check<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:14.239> home

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
factory I'm also going to check the home

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.530 
factory I'm also going to check the home
hardware<00:03:14.989> store<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.790> maybe<00:03:16.790> Canadian<00:03:17.299> Tire<00:03:17.510> a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
hardware store and maybe Canadian Tire a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.559 
hardware store and maybe Canadian Tire a
few<00:03:17.840> other<00:03:17.959> places<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:19.120> maybe<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.209> thicker

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
few other places for maybe a thicker

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.410 
few other places for maybe a thicker
coiled<00:03:21.079> spring<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:22.310> place<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.090> original

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
coiled spring in place of this original

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.869 
coiled spring in place of this original
spring<00:03:24.010> because<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.129> can<00:03:25.250> always<00:03:25.370> get<00:03:25.549> spring

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
spring because you can always get spring

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.750 
spring because you can always get spring
kits<00:03:26.150> even<00:03:26.420> princess<00:03:26.780> auto<00:03:26.959> carries<00:03:27.440> them<00:03:27.760> for

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
kits even princess auto carries them for

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.280 
kits even princess auto carries them for
guys<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.269> states<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.780> know<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.049> have

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
guys in the states you know you have

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.170 
guys in the states you know you have
Harbor<00:03:30.650> Freight<00:03:30.920> they<00:03:31.160> got<00:03:31.340> spring<00:03:31.670> kits<00:03:31.940> and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
Harbor Freight they got spring kits and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.259 
Harbor Freight they got spring kits and
you<00:03:33.170> can<00:03:33.440> manipulate<00:03:33.680> your<00:03:34.090> suspension<00:03:35.090> that

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
you can manipulate your suspension that

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.720 
you can manipulate your suspension that
way<00:03:35.480> too<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:36.590> changing<00:03:37.010> things<00:03:37.250> about<00:03:37.489> it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
way too just changing things about it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.430 
way too just changing things about it
maybe<00:03:37.910> making<00:03:38.239> some<00:03:38.540> improvements<00:03:38.810> here<00:03:39.290> and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
maybe making some improvements here and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.580 
maybe making some improvements here and
there<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.920> whatnot<00:03:40.579> but<00:03:41.230> it's<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> good<00:03:42.440> little

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
there and whatnot but it's a good little

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.610 
there and whatnot but it's a good little
fix<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.630> got<00:03:44.630> my<00:03:44.780> car<00:03:44.989> all<00:03:45.170> apart<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.590> pieces

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
fix I got my car all apart in pieces

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.949 
fix I got my car all apart in pieces
because<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.370> need<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.090> give<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.389> real<00:03:47.630> major

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
because I need to give it a real major

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.190 
because I need to give it a real major
cleaning<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.180> still<00:03:50.569> needs<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.870> little<00:03:50.989> bit

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
cleaning and it still needs a little bit

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.129 
cleaning and it still needs a little bit
more<00:03:51.260> yet<00:03:51.769> that's<00:03:52.760> why<00:03:52.940> everything's<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:54.019> would

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
more yet that's why everything's I would

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.699 
more yet that's why everything's I would
even<00:03:54.230> my<00:03:54.410> receiver<00:03:54.829> box<00:03:55.099> but<00:03:56.109> anyways<00:03:57.109> that's

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
even my receiver box but anyways that's

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.259 
even my receiver box but anyways that's
my<00:03:58.669> little<00:03:59.829> suspension<00:04:00.829> fix<00:04:01.519> there<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.090> when<00:04:02.239> I

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
my little suspension fix there so when I

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.000 
my little suspension fix there so when I
get<00:04:02.359> everything<00:04:02.720> all<00:04:02.959> back<00:04:03.260> together<00:04:03.500> and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
get everything all back together and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.420 
get everything all back together and
whatnot<00:04:04.880> I'll<00:04:05.329> take<00:04:05.959> her<00:04:06.079> for<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.319> run<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.829> see

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
whatnot I'll take her for a run and see

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.690 
whatnot I'll take her for a run and see
how<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.760> does<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.200> if<00:04:09.200> I'm<00:04:09.440> happy<00:04:09.680> cool<00:04:10.310> I'm

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
how it does and if I'm happy cool I'm

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.520 
how it does and if I'm happy cool I'm
not<00:04:10.880> happy<00:04:11.090> I'll<00:04:11.480> play<00:04:11.810> around<00:04:11.930> some<00:04:12.349> more

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
not happy I'll play around some more

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.129 
not happy I'll play around some more
until<00:04:12.799> I<00:04:12.889> get<00:04:13.069> it<00:04:13.160> set<00:04:13.400> up<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.760> right<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.329> at

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
until I get it set up just right and at

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.060 
until I get it set up just right and at
that<00:04:15.290> point<00:04:15.729> I'll<00:04:16.729> do<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.510> video<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.169> anyways
