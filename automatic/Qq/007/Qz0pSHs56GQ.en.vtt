would all have to be taken down from
YouTube<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.640> think<00:00:58.150> there's<00:00:58.810> something

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
YouTube and I think there's something

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.350 
YouTube and I think there's something
about<00:00:59.260> ten<00:00:59.680> strike<00:01:00.130> so<00:01:00.370> if<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.520> get<00:01:00.670> 10

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
about ten strike so if you get 10

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.530 
about ten strike so if you get 10
strikes<00:01:01.810> you<00:01:02.230> get<00:01:02.410> some<00:01:02.970> account<00:01:03.970> banned<00:01:04.239> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
strikes you get some account banned and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.649 
strikes you get some account banned and
you<00:01:04.600> could<00:01:04.780> get<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:04.989> fine<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.920> up<00:01:06.189> to<00:01:06.659> 150,000

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
you could get a fine of up to 150,000

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.380 
you could get a fine of up to 150,000
pounds<00:01:07.840> or<00:01:08.229> go<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.619> jail<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:09.490> I'm<00:01:09.759> not<00:01:09.969> just

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
talking about people trying to start out

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.989 
talking about people trying to start out
on<00:01:13.719> YouTube<00:01:14.140> recording<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.189> game<00:01:15.219> plays<00:01:15.700> and

and showing footage from video games

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.919 
and showing footage from video games
would<00:01:27.039> have<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.369> be<00:01:27.490> removed<00:01:28.210> from<00:01:28.509> YouTube

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
would have to be removed from YouTube

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
so literally the whole of machinable

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.370 
so literally the whole of machinable
machinima<00:01:33.999> would<00:01:34.179> have<00:01:34.389> to<00:01:34.509> be<00:01:34.600> shut<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:34.899> and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
machinima would have to be shut down and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.789 
machinima would have to be shut down and
it<00:01:36.340> will<00:01:36.670> just<00:01:36.819> have<00:01:37.060> catastrophic<00:01:37.799> effects

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
it will just have catastrophic effects

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.669 
it will just have catastrophic effects
on<00:01:39.450> even<00:01:40.450> things<00:01:40.810> such<00:01:41.079> as<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.350> economy

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
on even things such as the economy

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.359 
on even things such as the economy
because<00:01:42.869> machinima<00:01:43.869> is<00:01:44.020> such<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.319> big<00:01:44.740> power<00:01:45.100> in

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
because machinima is such a big power in

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.969 
because machinima is such a big power in
the<00:01:45.490> YouTube<00:01:45.909> community<00:01:46.259> gaming<00:01:47.259> probably

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
the YouTube community gaming probably

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.370 
the YouTube community gaming probably
makes<00:01:48.130> up<00:01:48.340> fifty<00:01:48.789> percent<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.359> all<00:01:49.539> videos<00:01:49.899> on

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
makes up fifty percent of all videos on

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.429 
makes up fifty percent of all videos on
YouTube<00:01:50.920> also<00:01:51.909> gaming<00:01:52.329> events<00:01:52.659> like<00:01:52.840> III

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
YouTube also gaming events like III

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.679 
YouTube also gaming events like III
won't<00:01:53.590> be<00:01:53.889> allowed<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.310> be<00:01:54.429> filmed<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.569> the

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
won't be allowed to be filmed and so the

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.269 
won't be allowed to be filmed and so the
combination<00:01:55.929> of<00:01:56.499> all<00:01:56.619> these<00:01:56.829> put<00:01:57.130> together

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
combination of all these put together

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.269 
combination of all these put together
would<00:01:58.149> take<00:01:58.420> us<00:01:58.600> back<00:01:58.810> 25<00:01:59.439> 30<00:01:59.799> years<00:01:59.979> where

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
would take us back 25 30 years where

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.339 
would take us back 25 30 years where
people<00:02:00.700> didn't<00:02:00.999> have<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.359> internet<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.990> they

people didn't have the internet and they

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.080 
people didn't have the internet and they

video of a game see if it was good

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.300 
video of a game see if it was good
people<00:02:07.389> won't<00:02:07.479> have<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.779> clue<00:02:08.080> what<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.039> buying

bill is in very early stages i think it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.670

was<00:03:57.100> introduced<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:58.090> May<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.049> it's<00:03:59.200> not<00:03:59.320> close

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
was introduced in May so it's not close

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.520 
was introduced in May so it's not close
to<00:03:59.890> being<00:03:59.920> passed<00:04:00.370> yet<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:02.110> worry<00:04:02.350> is

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
to being passed yet but the worry is

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.009 
to being passed yet but the worry is
that<00:04:02.560> there's<00:04:03.070> massive<00:04:04.000> companies<00:04:04.750> in

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
that there's massive companies in

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.009

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
video games if the amend it so that it's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.660 
video games if the amend it so that it's
so<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.960> doesn't<00:04:29.140> include

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
so that it doesn't include

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.600 
so that it doesn't include
video<00:04:29.970> games<00:04:30.240> no<00:04:31.080> it'd<00:04:31.290> be<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:31.680> right<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
video games no it'd be all right but the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.820 
video games no it'd be all right but the
I<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:34.080> people<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:34.590> law

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
I just think that the people in law

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.980 
I just think that the people in law
don't<00:04:35.490> understand<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.420> massive

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
don't understand the massive

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.590 
don't understand the massive
repercussions<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.860> habit<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.850> band

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
repercussions that habit the band

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.250 
repercussions that habit the band
showing<00:04:40.410> footage<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.370> gaming<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.940> videos<00:04:42.690> so

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
showing footage of gaming in videos so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.410 
showing footage of gaming in videos so
although<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.980> bill<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.520> still<00:04:44.790> very<00:04:45.120> far

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
although this bill is still very far

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.450 
although this bill is still very far
from<00:04:45.600> being<00:04:45.840> passed<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.620> being<00:04:46.920> part<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.340> the
