00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.740
 you are 5 years old when the team of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.089
 France won the World Cup you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 see reminding of that player yeah I 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.010
 remember we were watching the match in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 family with them with my father my brother 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.420
 and remember an emotion that's true 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.260
 an enthusiasm 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.940
 - share with not only the family 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 but but all the French what and 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 images that rest of the match yes the pictures 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.340
 the goals 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.780
 and then these images of joy from 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.780
 celebration it's true that it marked me 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.079
 we talked about your age 5 years at the time 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.479
 where zinedine zidane raises the cup of the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.640
 world is that one moment we can 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.379
 think that thirteen years later he is going 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.430
 pick up his phone for you 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 call to make you come to the real 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.009
 Madrid 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 it seems simple is realistic it's 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.009
 impossible to imagine it's a moment 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.200
 also from my life where I was 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.750
 that was really the madness had 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.970
 so much to think about doing and 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.720
 here it is true that I was a little 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.560
 destabilized and it was a moment 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 surrealist 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
 zinÃ©dine zidane today it drives 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.119
 the castilla maybe one day it will be 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.490
 your coach a medina 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.520
 maybe it's possible 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.710
 yes of course sure it's someone 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 I appreciate a lot and but I like it 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.640
 way to see football is 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.890
 someone who has invested in what he 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.899
 done and it's true that he likes 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.600
 also take care of the players who 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.090
 clicquot the result you therefore which it 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 always has wise advice 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.600
 so yes I think it's a good 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 coach so at the end and I like it 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.860
 here 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.540
 you became last year the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.020
 Younger French won the league 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.940
 champions 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.620
 you became last year too 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.850
 the youngest Frenchman has worn the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.830
 team captain 's armband 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 France that's a lot of things 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.810
 that I think I forget a little bit 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.890
 my age I look back a little 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.350
 she told me yeah already experienced what it already 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.290
 these cds it's true that it's good 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.810
 I'm happy with that and that's it 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 I hope I can continue on this 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.960
 launched and I'm still trying to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.790
 think about moving forward 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.940
 so I hope to go further 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.980
 possible the highest possible and that's 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.190
 for that I am very demanding towards 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.190
 myself 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970
 raphael is it possible 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380
 to have a normal life when you have 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 only 21 years old at the real 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.600
 Madrid 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.140
 we are already one of the leaders of the team 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.310
 de france how do we go about 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.280
 to have a normal life in quotation marks 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.010
 I think it's important to have a 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.810
 stable surrounding to keep feet 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.630
 on earth 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.270
 to be here well in his head well 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.190
 in his pumps and then that's it I think 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.880
 after that it's a balanced question 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.620
 it's important to sail close to 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.730
 know where we come from and where 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.730
 we are very important 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.980
 there is a kind of insurance that is 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.730
 exudes from you a serenity that is 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.490
 pretty amazing 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.980
 this quiet force she comes from where 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.440
 from your mom's dad it's coming 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.300
 Perhaps the origins I have my father 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.960
 is Martinique so the quiet side 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.430
 islanders we'll say so yeah that's 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.940
 maybe that's maybe it now 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.900
 I have always been like that 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.940
 so I do not know I think it's 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.710
 simply my nature my character who 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.710
 do I have that quiet side
