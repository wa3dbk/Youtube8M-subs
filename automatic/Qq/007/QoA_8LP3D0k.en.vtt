 atlanta more than 110 years ago 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.920

 he thought he tasted very tasty 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 of water and started selling it in glasses 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.670
 for five cents each the legend 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.230
 says that to a pharmacy employee 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 accidentally mixed the syrup with 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.820
 carbonated water making it 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.370
 produce the well-known little bubbles 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.520
 He served it with ice to customers and 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.130
 they were fascinated, the rest is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.410
 history the doctor's counter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.410

 Dr. Pemberton never imagined the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.700
 incredible future that awaited his 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.430

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.920
 secret formula to a businessman 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.270

 coca-cola was only served in glasses in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.070
 soda fountains until one day a couple 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.550
 of businessmen had a great 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.470
 Mr. Handler thought it was a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.510
 stupid silly idea that authorized the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.610

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.830
 of course what he did not sell was his recipe 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.110
