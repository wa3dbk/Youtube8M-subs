00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 a second trying step by these 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.010
 field changes d difference already 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
 therefore motorcycle marc coma and cyril 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.340
 després conceded ground to lopez 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.170
 and spoke first in auto stéphane 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.980
 peterhansel and the mini team 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980
 low on the general 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.240
 it had been two years since we had 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.070
 not seen marc coma at the arrival of a 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.330
 special on the dakar absent the year 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.650
 last Spanish comes back with 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.390
 desire for victory on this new 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.890
 edition the first day there maybe 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.600
 comforted in his ambitions anyway 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.290
 he finished in front of his best enemy 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.580
 his rival if there were prizes is still 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.110
 once today the two big ones 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.610
 motorcycle favorites did not leave each other 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.720
 an inner tube on arrival 20 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.730
 seconds apart and coma is always 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.390
 in front of prices but the race is 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.949
 went faster to the shoulders 4 coma was 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.510
 always in the light of joan barreda 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.160
 but the end of the special 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.840
 completely upset the motorcycle race to 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.550
 the arrival a surprise the British 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.989
 Sat sunderland on his honda lens which 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.370
 go impose them a single 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.290
 participation so far for him a 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.060
 abandonment at the third stage in 2012 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.070
 a lot of revenge and big gaps in 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.450
 the arrival he goes ahead chaleco lopez to 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.050
 less than a minute and joan barreda is wearing 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.820
 two minutes 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.229
 Catalan on his honda the most regular 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.940
 since yesterday takes control of the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.110
 general in front of chaleco and sam 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.090
 sunderland so who does the right 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.979
 day operation marc coma and cyril 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.570
 després who dropped ends 9th and 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.680
 10th today have therefore conceded more 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.050
 eight minutes on the winner 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.820
 bang your head I saw a few 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.310
 stars but the worst is my pocket 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.159
 of cameras that broke out and so that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.869
 made five years that I have more water so 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.159
 thirsty both coma men and 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.420
 prices will now move forward masked in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.460
 this race unlike French 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.020
 on his sherco alain duclos again a 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 times in the top 5 and that concerns everything 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 likewise almost six minutes to the finish 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.600
 he is 4th overall 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.730
 in cars the special was a little bit more 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.200
 long 433 km it has already allowed 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 skimming in the ranking 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320
 the minis held their rank the 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.030
 competition she sank carlo alone 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.410
 scene on his audience and giniel of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.000
 villiers came to interpose 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.090
 ranking and stood up to stéphane 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.590
 peterhansel winner of the 27th stage at 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.030
 more than 15 minutes of the race leader 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.220
 this morning giniel de villiers on his 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.420
 toyota did a good job a little bit more 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.950
 five minutes still late to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.320
 arrival but close in the standings 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.270
 general the days follow each other and do not 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.850
 do not look like souza on his downline 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.530
 turbo problems of 2 km 33 and 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.820
 long minutes abandoned just like 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.880
 hope of podium on arrival at 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.350
 valparaiso our downstream piloted him by 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 christian lavieille managed to return 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.830
 in the top 10 a reward for the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.200
 French who finally has a machined steering wheel 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.760
 and can express himself 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 on the mini side that dominates this beginning of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.580
 dakar nasser al attiyah could have 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.470
 hope better than this fifth place 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.300
 of the day more than 7 minutes from his 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.980
 teammate fart russell i can tell 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.640
 that he played bad luck by puncturing 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.440
 three times 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.640
 finally on this stage room one 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.810
 Twenty drivers succeeded 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 today to finish at less than one 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.420
 winner time 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.420
 this second step left traces 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 a thought for kurt caselli at the start 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 from this dakar 2014 the ktm pilots will have 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 all a sticker on their motorcycles in 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.840
 tribute to the american castelli 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.250
 coma replacing last year found 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.810
 death only 30 years old in november 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 last at the lead bar at 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.480
 mexico in the motorcycle ranking the three 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.220
 first of the day we find them at 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.260
 first three places of the general they 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.750
 have already dug a small gap marc coma 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.520
 complete the top 5 but he already has seven 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.620
 minutes late on the race leader 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.210
 stephane peterhansel him blow 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.280
 double during this second stage he 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.170
 takes orders from the general and mini 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.150
 place four cars in the top 5 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.680
 only carlos end for the moment is in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.740
 able to stand up to the mark 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 German 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.410
 place at the third stage tomorrow between 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.610
 san rafael and without rights nor any of the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.140
 shorter of this dakar 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.790
 the special she will still be 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.400
 consequent a little longer for the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.530
 motorcycles 373 km against 320 for trucks 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.610
 and cars not yet sand or 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.870
 dunes but seals but we will pass 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.040
 the three thousand meters of altitude 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.310
 we leave ourselves on these beautiful images 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.310
 present-day 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.450
 thereby 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.030
 the score one
