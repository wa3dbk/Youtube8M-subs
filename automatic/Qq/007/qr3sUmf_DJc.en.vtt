it<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.810> sort<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.290> slight<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> line<00:01:32.369> across

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it was sort of a slight a line across

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
it was sort of a slight a line across
and<00:01:33.090> we'll<00:01:33.210> square<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.960> sort<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> fades
