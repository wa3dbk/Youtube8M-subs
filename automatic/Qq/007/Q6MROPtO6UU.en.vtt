discussion about mad life's Thresh which

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
discussion about mad life's Thresh which
just<00:01:51.360> seemed<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.780> phenomenal<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.740> lot

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
just seemed to be phenomenal and a lot

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.050 
just seemed to be phenomenal and a lot
of<00:01:52.920> people<00:01:53.040> debating<00:01:53.460> whether<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.030> was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of people debating whether or not it was

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
of people debating whether or not it was
a<00:01:54.149> good<00:01:54.210> idea<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.600> us<00:01:55.590> maybe<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.890> should<00:01:56.009> have

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
a good idea to us maybe we should have

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
a good idea to us maybe we should have
banned<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.490> instead<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.969> letting<00:01:57.119> him<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.479> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
banned it instead of letting him have it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
banned it instead of letting him have it
do<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.189> reasonable

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
do you think that that's a reasonable

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.280 
do you think that that's a reasonable
thing<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.329> were<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.899> too<00:02:00.990> many<00:02:01.110> other

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
thing or were there just too many other

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.469 
thing or were there just too many other
things<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> need<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> van<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.909> it's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
things you need a van well it's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
things you need a van well it's
reasonable<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.500> should<00:02:04.530> have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
reasonable to say that we should have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.280 
reasonable to say that we should have
added<00:02:05.100> by<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> same<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:06.540> guys<00:02:06.600> the

Koreans they have so many strong
champions<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.610> hard<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.060> say<00:02:25.240> which<00:02:25.540> we

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
champions it's hard to say which we

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.210 
champions it's hard to say which we
should<00:02:25.930> abandon<00:02:26.230> nothing<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.770> retrospect

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
should abandon nothing in retrospect

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.980 
should abandon nothing in retrospect
obviously<00:02:27.790> because<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.300> lodged<00:02:28.450> sure<00:02:28.720> been

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
obviously because we lodged sure been

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.690 
obviously because we lodged sure been
reassured<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.650> something<00:02:30.070> differently<00:02:30.400> but

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
reassured that something differently but

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.730 
reassured that something differently but
how<00:02:31.330> thinkin<00:02:31.630> bands<00:02:31.900> were<00:02:31.990> necessarily<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
how thinkin bands were necessarily the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.520 
how thinkin bands were necessarily the
reason<00:02:33.100> why<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.250> lost<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.480> afterwards<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.290> saw

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
reason why we lost now afterwards we saw

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.680 
reason why we lost now afterwards we saw
the<00:02:35.590> Koreans<00:02:36.430> dominate<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.090> Chinese<00:02:37.450> does

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
the Koreans dominate the Chinese does

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.670 
the Koreans dominate the Chinese does
