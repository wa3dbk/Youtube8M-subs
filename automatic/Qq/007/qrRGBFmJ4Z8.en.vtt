the belt and if it's like any of my

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:56.209 
the belt and if it's like any of my
other<00:00:54.629> Tamiya<00:00:55.019> bills<00:00:55.319> let's<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.859> be<00:00:55.979> very

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
other Tamiya bills let's gonna be very

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.509 
other Tamiya bills let's gonna be very
smooth<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.679> gonna<00:00:58.799> start<00:00:59.069> working<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.459> our

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
smooth so I'm gonna start working on our

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.369 
smooth so I'm gonna start working on our
servo<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.659> off<00:01:00.929> here<00:01:01.139> we're<00:01:01.229> going<00:01:01.319> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
servo first off here we're going to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
servo first off here we're going to
build<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> servo<00:01:02.159> saver<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.999> is<00:01:03.179> a<00:01:03.329> three

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
build the servo saver so this is a three

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.310 
build the servo saver so this is a three
part<00:01:04.640> there's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> mounting<00:01:06.090> plate<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.990> horn

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
part there's a mounting plate the horn

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
part there's a mounting plate the horn
itself<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.960> screw<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.260> place<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.810> from

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
itself and screw that in place and from

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
itself and screw that in place and from
there<00:01:13.050> we<00:01:13.230> have<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.590> servo<00:01:13.920> mounting

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there we have the servo mounting

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.360 
there we have the servo mounting
brackets<00:01:14.730> need<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.120> screw<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.380> two

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
brackets need to screw those in so two

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.280 
brackets need to screw those in so two
screws<00:01:17.730> will<00:01:17.910> get<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.240> secure<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> now

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
screws will get that secure and now

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
screws will get that secure and now
we're<00:01:22.590> looking<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.790> body<00:01:24.120> posts<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
we're looking for our body posts and I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230 
we're looking for our body posts and I
should<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.690> realized<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.140> were<00:01:28.260> Chrome<00:01:29.240> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
should have realized they were Chrome so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.370 
should have realized they were Chrome so
we<00:01:30.330> have<00:01:30.420> four<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.750> these<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.080> have<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.320> pop<00:01:31.530> off

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
we have four of these we have to pop off

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.470 
we have four of these we have to pop off
and<00:01:34.380> those<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.830> just<00:01:35.010> gonna<00:01:35.160> go<00:01:35.370> on<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.790> the

else is on this kit alright and our
final<00:01:45.690> one<00:01:45.870> there<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.440> mount<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
final one there so now to mount the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
final one there so now to mount the
serval<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.250> place<00:01:51.680> two<00:01:52.680> screws<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.170> have

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
serval in place two screws and you have

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.920 
serval in place two screws and you have
that<00:01:55.560> secure<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.440> our<00:01:58.470> electronics

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
that secure so now on to our electronics

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
that secure so now on to our electronics
so<00:02:00.930> double-sided<00:02:01.650> tape<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.130> always<00:02:02.490> secure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so double-sided tape is always secure

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.570 
so double-sided tape is always secure
the<00:02:03.360> ESC<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.990> space<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the ESC in space and now for the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.110 
the ESC in space and now for the
receiver<00:02:09.769> same<00:02:10.769> thing<00:02:11.099> there<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.790> push<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
receiver same thing there just push it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.059 
receiver same thing there just push it
down<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.569> we're<00:02:12.659> secure<00:02:15.469> fit<00:02:16.469> all<00:02:16.650> our<00:02:16.680> leads

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
down and we're secure fit all our leads

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.930 
down and we're secure fit all our leads
through

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
through

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.870 
through
connect<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.360> our<00:02:18.510> servo<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
connect up our servo and now we're on to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880 
connect up our servo and now we're on to
the<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> guess<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.660> most<00:02:21.870> complicated<00:02:22.230> part<00:02:22.740> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the I guess the most complicated part of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.190 
the I guess the most complicated part of
the<00:02:22.980> build<00:02:23.160> will<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.640> trance<00:02:23.910> which<00:02:24.840> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the build will be the trance which is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.740 
the build will be the trance which is
pretty<00:02:25.500> simple<00:02:25.890> setup<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.600> our

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
pretty simple setup so we have our

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.170 
pretty simple setup so we have our
output<00:02:27.810> shaft<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> bevel<00:02:29.310> gear<00:02:32.180> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
output shaft we have a bevel gear and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.530 
output shaft we have a bevel gear and
now<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.810> trans<00:02:34.470> itself<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.820> two

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
now the trans itself so we have the two

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.870 
now the trans itself so we have the two
Center<00:02:36.960> gears<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.320> are<00:02:37.380> sitting<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.920> two

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
Center gears that are sitting on two

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.020 
Center gears that are sitting on two
bearings<00:02:39.740> now<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.800> three<00:02:41.130> spires<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.670> inside

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
bearings now the three spires go inside

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.370 
bearings now the three spires go inside
the<00:02:42.270> diff<00:02:42.480> itself<00:02:44.660> now<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> other<00:02:46.110> output

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
the diff itself now the other output

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.090

onto<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.320> chassis<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:48.030> these<00:03:48.180> two

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
onto the chassis so we have these two

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.420 
onto the chassis so we have these two
side<00:03:48.630> pieces<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:49.200> sure<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.560> call<00:03:49.830> them<00:03:50.160> but

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
side pieces not sure you call them but

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.150 
side pieces not sure you call them but
those<00:03:50.670> will<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.269> similar<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.530> guess<00:03:52.920> the

those will be similar to I guess the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.600 
those will be similar to I guess the

those<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.910> push<00:03:57.120> into<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.510> chassis<00:03:59.239> and<00:04:00.239> you

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
those just push into the chassis and you

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.880 
those just push into the chassis and you
get<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.570> better<00:04:00.780> angle<00:04:00.989> from<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.470> side<00:04:01.709> here

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
get a better angle from this side here

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.620 
get a better angle from this side here
sir<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.430> they<00:04:02.610> pushed<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.239> into<00:04:03.510> the
