00:00:00.034 --> 00:00:03.012
 Yeah, I really hope that I am on vacation every day!! 

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:04.021
 I think so too, little brother. 

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.075
 If we can come to the resort soon, it would be fine. 

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:09.046
 Are you referring to sailing? (Liu Ding treats the souer of the gnome apple as a schooner sailboat near the sound) 

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.017
 Hey, Liu Ding 

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:12.038
 What happened, gnome apple 

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:15.036
 You look a bit serious (stern is strict and serious, but there is a stern meaning, pun) 

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.018
 This guy doesn't know what a vacation is like? 

00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:19.072
 No, you can relax, but don't be like a pear. 

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.006
 He is really too relaxed (went overboard = too much, can be literally translated to run out of the boat) 

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.089
 Ah, finally you can enjoy this peace and quiet. 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.081
 Hey! Hey! Pear! Hey! 

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.065
 No, don't care about him, you are on vacation. 

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:31.083
 Hey, pear! Hey! Pear! 

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:33.032
 How? What are you doing? 

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:34.034
 Marco~ 

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.050
 No, you don't want to... 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.052
 Marco~ 

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.050
 Oh, that’s enough. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.031
 Marco Marco Marco Marco Marco Marco 

00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.033
 Poloboro 

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.025
 Can you let me alone now? 

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:44.042
 Hey! Hey! Pear! 

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.025
 What? 

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.018
 duck! 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.077
 Hey, I just haven’t seen it before, how are you? 

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:55.072
 I mean 

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:57.070
 Why do you want ducks made of rubber? 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.068
 Don't worry, there is nothing worthy of your pears to collapse (crackup = mental breakdown, but Liu Ding deliberately said "quackd up" quack is a duck call, laughing at the pears being scared by rubber ducks) 

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.098
 Look, there is a rope on the duck. 

00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:04.093
 I don't know where it is from... 

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:07.030
 The boat over there! 

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.065
 I think he is talking to us. 

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.081
 Yes, I have heard more of this. 

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:13.055
 Open fire! 

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.034
 Hey! You soaked my biscuits! 

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:19.066
 Yes, there is even worse behind! 

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.059
 Unless you bring my probe boat back! 

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:24.007
 Hey... Do you mean the duck? 

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.023
 Yes, my duck 

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:27.074
 Hey! Hey! Blueberry Beard Captain! Hey! 

00:01:27.074 --> 00:01:29.008
 Yes, it is me! 

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:31.029
 Hey... is this really your name? 

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.057
 Yes 

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.017
 Sooner or later, this will happen in the end. 

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:38.055
 I am the cruelest and most dangerous pirate in the Seven Seas. 

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.043
 Hey... are you referring to the bathtub? 

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:44.022
 Tell me now what treasures are on your deck. 

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.035
 Treasure? We have no treasures. 

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.052
 Are you an idiot? 

00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:49.010
 If you don’t have a treasure on board 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.021
 Why do you want to bring a navy Liuding? (naval orange=navel orange, a kind of willow but naval has a navy meaning) 

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.011
 Navel orange? 

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.065
 I am not the guy who looks like a navel. 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.072
 What the hell! Who opened the fire!? 

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:03.081
 Oh, sorry, I thought you just said fire. 

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.068
 I am talking about "Yarr"!!! (Emotional expressions used by ancient pirates, the meaning of expression is not fixed, depending on the situation) 

00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:08.019
 But the captain, this tells you that the fire is really like it. 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.019
 I... I mean... you both got off the boat!! 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.035
 Come on, brother! 

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:16.034
 You traitors! 

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:18.022
 That board is not for you to play. 

00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:20.000
 It is used to rob!! 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.061
 Hey! Hey! Moldy chin captain! 

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.078
 Do you know why you live on board? 

00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:24.001
 Why? 

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.049
 Because you are the mini size for travel. 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.093
 Oh no, I’m coming. 

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:30.040
 No one, fruit or vegetable 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.052
 Can make a fuss about my size! 

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:36.027
 Whether you are a navy or not, I have to cut your skin!! I am peeling faster than a septic sailor!! (Citrus can cure septicemia, so sick sailors will rush to peel and eat citrus) 

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:39.015
 Hey, happy with you (whatever floats your boat, as you are happy, literally means "follow your boat", pun) 

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:41.016
 Prepare for boarding attack!! 

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.024
 Hey, everyone? 

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:43.067
 The situation is not very good 

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.058
 I know, I hate being bored too! (Liu Ding treats boarding board as boring bored) 

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:48.022
 I told you that I should take a banana boat! 

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:51.010
 Prepare to fight, or else I will jump off the sea! 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.054
 Hey, everyone, I haven’t told you before, but... 

00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:54.096
 I can't swim. 

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:56.044
 Dude, we can't all swim. 

00:02:57.037 --> 00:02:58.067
 Hey! Hey! Blueberry! 

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:01.032
 I heard that your ship is going to be sold? (He said that on sail is homophonic with on sell, sail is a sail, on sell is to sell, pun) 

00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:04.029
 This guy is simply an idiot who doesn't understand sailing. 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.003
 What? At least I still know English letters. 

00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.039
 Unlike you can only remember "C" at most (Liu Ding is a joke, the pirates can't remember all the letters, because their time is spent on C [C and sea homophonic]) 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.048
 You are a slap in the middle of the pirate!! (This is a joke, the pirates can't remember all the letters, because their time is spent on C [C and sea homophonic]) 

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:15.006
 Open fire!! 

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.019
 Oh, I started to think that the captain of the beard he seems to be serious. 

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:19.019
 Don't worry, everyone. 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.041
 I have a small plan... 

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:24.012
 I think this idea is not very good, everyone. 

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:26.068
 Oh! Unfair! I also want to fly to the sky like a unicorn! 

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:28.081
 Sorry, only your size is just right. 

00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:29.074
 Don't worry, gnome apple 

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:32.016
 You can have a good time (have a blast, have a good time, but literally blast, explode) 

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:34.029
 How many times have I told you... 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.093
 It’s a small apple~~ 

00:03:37.093 --> 00:03:40.061
 Hey, throw him over the bow, right? 

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.068
 fight back! 

00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:45.058
 Captain...that's...that's... 

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.041
 I told you to open fire! Open fire! 

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.061
 That is... that is... 

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.082
 What are you talking about? 

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:53.010
 Swirl!! 

00:03:57.033 --> 00:04:00.032
 Hey, this holiday is really going to go down (going down the drain, refers to the bubble soup, the former work is abandoned but can be literally translated into the flow pipe, pun) 

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:12.037
 Well, it's actually pretty good (ducky, spoken is good, good, but duck is also a duck) 

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:14.074
 Ok, stop talking about your jokes. 

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:17.068
 Seriously, my head hurts. 

00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:22.092
 Yeah~ I just asked a new friend to come back to the kitchen with us. He said yes, yeah! 

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:24.022
 Hey, marshmallow 

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.010
 You should know the rubber duck, he 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.023
 It’s just rubber, right? 

00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:30.038
 Hey, what do you say, 梨, pear 

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:37.086
