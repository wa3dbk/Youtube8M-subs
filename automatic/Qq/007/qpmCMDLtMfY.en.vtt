00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
plastic tip and tail is gonna make it a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.040 
plastic tip and tail is gonna make it a
little<00:02:43.930> bit<00:02:44.110> lighter<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.790> stronger<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.959> when

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
little bit lighter and stronger so when

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
you're going to spin or in the POW it's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.010 
you're going to spin or in the POW it's
gonna<00:02:48.790> float<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.300> little<00:02:49.420> bit<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:49.870> it's

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
gonna float a little bit because it's

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.390 
gonna float a little bit because it's
lighter<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.680> fight<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:50.950> much<00:02:51.100> weight

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
lighter not have to fight as much weight

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.210 
lighter not have to fight as much weight
and<00:02:51.640> again<00:02:52.209> those<00:02:52.390> edges<00:02:52.810> stop<00:02:53.590> right<00:02:54.010> here

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
and again those edges stop right here

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.820 
and again those edges stop right here
and<00:02:54.459> wrap<00:02:54.670> into<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.270> core<00:02:55.630> give<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
and wrap into your core give them the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.560 
and wrap into your core give them the
edges<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> lot<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.430> extra<00:02:57.610> strength<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.420> I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
edges a lot of extra strength and I

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
edges a lot of extra strength and I
haven't<00:02:58.780> seen<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> pop<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> long<00:02:59.650> time

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.490 

and<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:03.550> we<00:03:03.640> got<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.820> little<00:03:03.970> AG<00:03:04.870> one<00:03:05.170> wood

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and then we got a little AG one wood

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.410 
and then we got a little AG one wood
core<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.310> that's<00:03:06.400> our<00:03:06.550> alter<00:03:06.940> genetic

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420
