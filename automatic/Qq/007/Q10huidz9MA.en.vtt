the spatula out and was trying to put it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.420 
the spatula out and was trying to put it
into<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.840> container<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:31.800> thick<00:00:32.219> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
into this little container how thick it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.090 
into this little container how thick it
was<00:00:32.870> on<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.170> top<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> foundation<00:00:35.070> that

was on the top of the foundation that
has<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.640> flip<00:00:35.910> top<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
less the same shade as the foundation so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
less the same shade as the foundation so
it's<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.090> meant<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.420> under-eye<00:00:42.780> brightening

or<00:00:43.379> anything<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.010> more<00:00:44.160> meant

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
or anything like that it's more meant

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760

only have one face to makeup everyday so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
only have one face to makeup everyday so
anyways<00:01:28.320> let<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> review

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
anyways let me get back with the review

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
anyways let me get back with the review
okay<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.560> said<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> spatula<00:01:32.369> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
okay so like I said it has a spatula so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
okay so like I said it has a spatula so
that's<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.090> cool<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.740> prefer<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that's pretty cool but I really prefer a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.440 
that's pretty cool but I really prefer a
pump<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
pump but I think that they have the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
pump but I think that they have the
spatula<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> formula<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.979> thick

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
spatula because the formula is so thick

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
spatula because the formula is so thick
that's<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> reason<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> maybe<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.259> pump<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that's the reason and maybe a pump it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.980 
that's the reason and maybe a pump it
would<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.070> stuck<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.710> my<00:01:44.240> washer<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.509> going

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
would get stuck and my washer is going

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.520 
would get stuck and my washer is going
crazy<00:01:46.200> I'll<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:49.200> Sephora

the demo

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.330 
the demo
let<00:02:11.120> me<00:02:11.210> open<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.570> little<00:02:12.500> baggie<00:02:12.740> oh<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
let me open this little baggie oh the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.120 
let me open this little baggie oh the
shade<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.700> was<00:02:13.850> matched<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.330> was<00:02:14.660> light<00:02:15.130> number

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
shade I was matched to was light number

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.570 
shade I was matched to was light number
three<00:02:16.670> which<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.150> was<00:02:17.270> really<00:02:17.540> shocked<00:02:17.960> because

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
three which I was really shocked because

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.010 
three which I was really shocked because
I'm<00:02:19.580> usually<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> light<00:02:20.480> I'm<00:02:20.660> usually<00:02:20.810> a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
I'm usually not a light I'm usually a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.620 
I'm usually not a light I'm usually a
medium<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.860> they<00:02:22.730> literally<00:02:23.150> don't<00:02:23.450> have

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
medium so they literally don't have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.720 
medium so they literally don't have
really<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> good<00:02:24.530> range<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.220> colors<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.670> think

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
really a good range of colors I think

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
really a good range of colors I think
there's<00:02:26.180> only<00:02:26.330> around<00:02:26.480> ten<00:02:26.870> colors<00:02:27.230> maybe

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
there's only around ten colors maybe

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.230 
there's only around ten colors maybe
I'll<00:02:28.100> put<00:02:28.370> how<00:02:28.490> many<00:02:28.550> shades<00:02:28.880> there<00:02:29.090> are

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
I'll put how many shades there are

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.200 
I'll put how many shades there are
exactly<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.470> felt<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.430> for<00:02:31.940> me<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> be

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
exactly here I felt like for me to be

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.820 
exactly here I felt like for me to be
light<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.810> means<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.200> there's<00:02:33.410> not<00:02:33.560> enough

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
light that means that there's not enough

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.610 
light that means that there's not enough
lighter<00:02:34.820> tones<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.870> people<00:02:36.170> who<00:02:36.290> are<00:02:36.410> more

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
lighter tones for people who are more

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.420 
lighter tones for people who are more
pale<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.370> that's<00:02:37.940> kind<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.450> downfall<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.680> let

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
pale so that's kind of downfall and let

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.220

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
super super thick it doesn't feel as

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
shocked at how thick the formula was so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
shocked at how thick the formula was so
I'm<00:02:53.840> gonna<00:02:53.990> go<00:02:54.110> ahead<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.350> apply<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.160> I'm

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
purchasing it down purchasing it down

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.480 
purchasing it down purchasing it down
like<00:04:23.940> later<00:04:24.180> down<00:04:24.509> the<00:04:24.539> road<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.400> adding<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
like later down the road and adding it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.980 
like later down the road and adding it
to<00:04:26.520> my<00:04:26.610> collection<00:04:26.729> just<00:04:27.360> because<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.660> really

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
to my collection just because I really

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.050 
to my collection just because I really
really<00:04:28.199> like<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.009> so<00:04:29.460> definitely<00:04:29.880> with<00:04:30.030> a

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
really like it so definitely with a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.909 
really like it so definitely with a
built-in<00:04:30.630> concealer<00:04:31.259> I<00:04:31.289> think<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.770> would<00:04:31.889> just

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
built-in concealer I think it would just

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.460 
built-in concealer I think it would just
give<00:04:32.250> even<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.090> more<00:04:33.330> flawless<00:04:33.570> coverage<00:04:34.169> if

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
give even a more flawless coverage if

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.499 
give even a more flawless coverage if
you<00:04:34.500> needed<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.039> extra<00:04:35.250> coverage<00:04:35.789> for<00:04:36.120> acne

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
you needed that extra coverage for acne

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.210 
you needed that extra coverage for acne
marks<00:04:36.660> or<00:04:36.930> anything<00:04:37.080> like<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.800> do

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
marks or anything like that I do

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.499 
marks or anything like that I do
definitely<00:04:38.669> recommend<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.300> for<00:04:39.449> people

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
definitely recommend this for people

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.589 
definitely recommend this for people
with<00:04:39.990> oily<00:04:40.289> combination<00:04:40.710> skin<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:42.090> also<00:04:42.479> if

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
with oily combination skin and also if

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.350 
with oily combination skin and also if
you<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> lot<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.260> problematic<00:04:44.220> areas<00:04:44.849> that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
you have a lot of problematic areas that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.149 
you have a lot of problematic areas that
you<00:04:45.479> need<00:04:45.659> a<00:04:45.690> full<00:04:45.990> coverage<00:04:46.260> I<00:04:46.680> think<00:04:46.740> that

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
you need a full coverage I think that

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:48.830 
you need a full coverage I think that
this<00:04:47.310> would<00:04:47.490> be<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.820> really<00:04:48.270> really<00:04:48.389> great

this would be a really really great

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.589 
this would be a really really great
foundation<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.740> also<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:50.849> creamy<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.449> it

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
foundation it also is so creamy that it

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.409 
foundation it also is so creamy that it
blends<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.260> really<00:04:52.289> nicely<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.490> I'm<00:04:54.240> not

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.629 
blends in really nicely and I'm not
really<00:04:54.570> sure<00:04:54.840> if<00:04:55.229> you're<00:04:56.070> people<00:04:56.340> with<00:04:56.460> dry
