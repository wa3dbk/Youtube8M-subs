00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.230
 grow and also have good support and 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.420
 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.269
 is a network that I believe and 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.340
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.640
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.890
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.370
 network business it offers a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.859
 minimum payment of $ 1 or is your 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.340
 car yields at least $ 1 per month 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.620
 You get that money something else. 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 network has a temporary contract of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900
 three months you can stay in the network 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.299
 for three months if you do not like it 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 just ask them they cancel 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.250
 your contract in case you want 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.400
 continue your contract is only one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.079
 year and finally it was something I think 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.000
 more interesting 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.579
 the network has a contract in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.349
 Portuguese and also a support in 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.160
 Portuguese for those who want more 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.410
 information on the network link and a video 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.919
