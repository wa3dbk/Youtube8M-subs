00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.320
 there everyone is blake turp then 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.450
 sorry for my disgusting box that 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.330
 is acting at the microphone waiting I think 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.240
 really that there is one he has in all 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.960
 case it did not last very long 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.250
 otherwise so in fact I make you very 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.900
 quickly these little videos because 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.490
 so I had misinterpreted actually 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.140
 an information so here is so if you 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.070
 went on ford stop at ounce before i 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.690
 do not know because maybe you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.460
 never go on the forum because 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.600
 that there are sometimes things a ground 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.230
 interesting enough while as 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.660
 by these the ball 06 operations of in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 does the future also that's the name of the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.480
 project for black ops 2 version made her 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.620
 for data one so I'm not going to say 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.810
 that it's for data one that it does 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.010
 because they are only partners 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.900
 after just remember now you 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.850
 translate all that they are only 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.670
 partner but good here 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.640
 personally it's someone like 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.480
 so npa the main developer who the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
 made 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470
 after I do not say it's him I say 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.079
 not that it's not him here I'm saying 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.070
 just good they are just partners 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.170
 so maybe they are two people 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.239
 different physically physically 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.430
 no idea finally if I know it 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.080
 personally but well ok we do not care 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.600
 because we're not really here to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.090
 to talk about it simply because in fact 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.030
 this is just so free pre pre alpha 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.200
 preview willis custom games puts in 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.850
 big what does it mean so 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 is a pre-pre alpha so already a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
 alfa it's before the beta before the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.760
 final version so if you want that's it 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.409
 and pre pre good alpha so that's it 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.799
 something already very very basic 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.770
 so a basically a little overview in 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.350
 only done with private matches 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.570
 it's less than the private image he's me 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.010
 seems from what I read so in 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.900
 celebration for the million 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.640
 users who have registered 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.830
 on our partner site on our 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960
 partner on our partner site 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.670
 strong delta one so indeed so we're going 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.409
 downstairs we were good I think reached 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.450
 the million game Friday night 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.830
 I do not know where they are 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.850
 million 1.1 million 10 and 17 thousand 15 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.710
 members which is still not bad 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.070
 of course it's not members 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 separated there are a lot of conchita us 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.519
 so we go out a small a common 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.529
 are we going out a version rather 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.060
 planned others after three days of 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:16.769
 group work 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.540
 testis so who is the name of the project 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.060
 done at the base it's not black ops of the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.650
 name was 6 like t5 for black ops 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 it seems to me I doubled 4th doubled 5th for 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.920
 a new 3 and so that's who you 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.280
 will allow to join steps 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 private 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.890
 I believe or at least matches 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.970
 matches by being invited by your friends 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.200
 I think it's actually his comeback 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.760
 private damage done in three minutes 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.859
 that is to say in fact you have to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.890
 be friends on this fort delta one for 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.959
 to be able to play between you so be careful 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.049
 however this version is bedi 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.790
 there is no support and we use to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.180
 our peril we will say that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940
 like that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.480
 that is, those with the rating 2 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.150
 on steam 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.440
 they do not say in any case if it's so 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.970
 we can play we will say side by side or 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.069
 if you have to make a file next to it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.019
 also here is that it may cause 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.239
 ban steamboat I do not know absolutely 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.500
 nothing finally at least it's not he knows 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.150
 not write it maybe it has been 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.449
 says somewhere but I have not seen so 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.269
 basically just what you do 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.099
 it's the limit if you want to play 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.930
 just put to preach if you 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.060
 have taken it out of course take 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.769
 your game copy it elsewhere and put 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.019
 and put the stuff of ford wing delta one 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.980
 so you will need a copy so 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.590
 of black ops 2 with preferably these 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.049
 dlc if you want to play on it 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.030
 below so it's not an obligation 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.549
 to help see we did not have 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.500
 again added a steam check 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.470
 so good after I do not know if you'll have 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.510
 see the legal game this shoe so 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.959
 added later to launch the zombie 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.359
 you have to launch the 6 m file 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.579
 these 6 mp pardon it must be executed with 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.840
 the zeddam parameter then simply that 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.010
 is what the good parameter zeddam 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.590
 personally I have not yet 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.049
 downloaded from the end six I have a bouquet 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.900
 here in fact it's just a piece of torrent 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.099
 but yeah actually if you want so 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.979
 throw him will just have to go so 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.540
 France in property will not even forgive 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.540
 finally make a shortcut 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.740
 create a short if voice the property is 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.320
 there in the target it will be even like 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.620
 drew students actually you're left of 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.130
 m 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 you apply ok here you will run to 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.890
 the limit maybe the trouble gets 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.270
 will launch I have not tested a little 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.200
 just inform you that there is some 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 thing I will do another video 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.990
 complementary when I have 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.120
 game download so I think from here 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.230
 three days 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.140
 also so you will need a tale 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.190
 on the site mentioned above so I 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.540
 be strong of the fight to wad wholesale so 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.000
 as if by chance you need an account on 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.460
 ford delta one good voila you see on 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.730
 is we agree I say what you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.140
 had said that it will not be anyway 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.700
 if it does, it will not be surfing delta 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.320
 one of which some paris is hiding a 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.460
 little bit as those in the six caches 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.990
 I think that for me there is now known 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 it is he who is behind all that and 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.890
 of course we can not leave 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.600
 one million accounts 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.160
 a million accounts is destroyed late 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:20.320
 to be lost earlier otherwise can yes so 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.910
 basically what you can really 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.590
 to let all of his 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.780
 accounts and after a little question 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.890
 kind of ironic ah well we can finally is 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.630
 what now brave father what 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.180
 in short we do not care is the English humor 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.670
 quite poorly translated so forums forums 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.320
 infoflash so that's actually it's 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.600
 a wine infoflash it's just a small 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.580
 forum the forum of showcase to know 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.070
 how to download the file you 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.590
 will have in the description the file 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.080
 torrent you can add for for 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.760
 download it to unload the stuff 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.460
 simply because in fact there there 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.840
 have to add something in front for 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.880
 that it download it directly in 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.230
 do you pay the torrent point and 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.810
 here you will have it will be a link 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.220
 megaupload or just the next 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.570
 updates will be posted here so 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.580
 stay alert while staying active at this 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.100
 page where here are the simply justice here 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.970
 so as I remember buggy version not 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.880
 of support 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.230
 so frankly even I do not know 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.690
 nothing I have not yet the I download it 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.500
 right now so here is take your trouble 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.090
 just wait for me 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.200
 I hope this video despite it being 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.190
 it's been there already for three days because 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.240
 that I actually understood 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.830
 instead that it is precisely a 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.480
 three-day version that was finally coming out 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.740
 after three days of work either it's 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.630
 a version for three days that 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.070
 was coming out here a little preview during 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.780
 three days and we do like his outings 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.680
 Friday Saturday Sunday I am 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.220
 returned today I saw the link 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.680
 at ea 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.350
 and there I actually reread yes after three 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.700
 working days so that's all hoping 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.270
 also not something that works to 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.490
 death etc 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.990
 but you can still always him 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.950
 try it then well we'll see me 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.170
 look for me I wish everyone a good 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.150
 good review weekend because it gets 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.150
 move closer to the next hi
