books book mins that's cool so it's on a
holographic<00:03:57.630> pidgeot<00:03:58.260> from<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.860> believe<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
holographic pidgeot from I believe that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.530 
holographic pidgeot from I believe that
is<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.800> set<00:04:02.070> is<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.490> fire<00:04:03.180> red<00:04:03.390> leaf

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
is a but what set is this fire red leaf

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140 
is a but what set is this fire red leaf
green<00:04:03.750> possibly<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.740> says<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.190> your<00:04:05.730> noona

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
green possibly so it says you your noona

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.350
