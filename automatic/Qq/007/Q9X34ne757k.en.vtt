00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 Hello, I want to do a little review 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:53.650
 about masks 3 it means they are with me 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.390
 different masks 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.730
 they have different series 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.160
 and that removes to and 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:13.300
 mean series 60 so they mean 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.310
 different there is 6100 6260 400 mean 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:22.260
 what is this size just different 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 there is washed away on the face contour with pulley scandal 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.009
 mask is not bad, I bought it first 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 but then I took another one this EDCTP 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.280
 mask 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:41.870
 filters prefilters i.e. all full 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:47.210
 Kit means after I took the 7500 series 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.240
 it means what is their difference but it is clear that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.750
 you can read on the website feature 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.230
 simply 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.680
 here the mask itself the front part goes 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.560
 Silicone, which is more soft here 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.150
 as if more fit 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.179
 more pleasant that is the temperature officially 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.330
 I can take it that is written that means 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.320
 filters 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.550
 they have both of these masks interchangeable 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.740
 that is, you can release if available 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.590
 spare sea ​​like I had with me 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:28.219
 there was this it was not these faithful 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:35.040
 stubs that is, it is disconnected but 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:37.769
 quickly out of charge this filter after all 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.099
 everyone will remember this kit fits 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:47.310
 and on this mask they are interrelated and between 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:49.939
 the series means but it's all as if nothing 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.040
 I terrible here too painted this Moscow 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.670
 small here is another material but in 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.799
 principle is okay too well 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.790
 everything new breathes in it is beautiful 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.290
 it filters the same way but personally 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.430
 for me the main difference is 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 direction exhale but with this mask y 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.670
 I had a story when I painted 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.410
 blue fig there if someone watched the video there 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.410
 there was a cant 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.239
 when I have condensation from this mask 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.130
 from here 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.390
 splashed as you exhale splashed dug 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.160
 during painting it was all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.930
 sand the degreaser and so on in 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:43.200
 general shoals chose but it was very 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.769
 that is unpleasant breath exhalation zone 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.440
 located frontally 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.989
 with a sharp exhale , I just splashed 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.519
 condensation from here and condensation is 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.730
 going like anyway here 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:04.739
 how could I not dramatically exhaled condensate 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.950
 It goes on to make a suit that is made 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.130
 exit down here it's on me as a 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.650
 the main difference and in principle it is possible 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.810
 use this quite a normal 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.790
 the place is nothing tougher and as it were on 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.609
 the touch is clear that silicone is of course softer 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.320
 but I am uncomfortable and this is not why 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.440
 the only negative is this way out 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.190
 will choose 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.190
 frontally 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.129
 then I want to say steadily 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.370
 so this mask is exactly oil respirator 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:44.050
 this is such a thing I have 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.349
 respirators 3m this one there are such 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.009
 there is just like gauze with this 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.819
 help 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.960
 ordinary this is exactly 3m ovsky 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:05:01.419
 respirator there such valve for exhalation 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:05.199
 apparently there is no such thing here 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:09.520
 respirator 3m Omsk further, but I like them 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.759
 would not use when working such 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.780
 lighter than u like painting 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.280
 I have this bought in the usual 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.800
 a hardware store ie for example 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.069
 if a 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.009
 good layer of putty or loose 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.680
 here I still want to use it when 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.009
 grouting dry very well 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.529
 also fly here but primed when 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:39.910
 I, too, in general, that is to get this 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:43.270
 fine filters 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.800
 I tried to breathe normally 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.830
 and as if in time primer I just 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.630
 removed the mask and tried to breathe that is 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.880
 in this smell mask even soil 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.630
 roughly speaking there was n't as soon as i wave 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.990
 scott face 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.600
 that is, I immediately knew what he was filtering 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.540
 very good despite the fact that this 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.730
 usual ordinary cheap mask again 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.160
 filter fell well and actually everything here 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.580
 such a small reviewer 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.960
 then by this stroke it lies to them 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.980
 here are three filters 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.500
 I do not regret them but it happens to me 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.840
 maxim if i let someone more beautiful 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.630
 big example 1 bow on the head two 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.970
 times we use now we change 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:37.720
 but someone closes in small ones 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:40.660
 made to my opinion on the channel he saw 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.760
 closes just respirators only 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.370
 not so usually wound to 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.760
 talk to the economy will sing filter 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.760
 I have 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.680
 I don’t do that 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.610
 this is the time when pikachu 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.540
 Well, such a small review is all that 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.430
 wanted to show 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:10.150
 but I want to say who is missing 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:12.040
 you leave before you understand and everything is beautiful 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.200
 specialized service centers 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.780
 denmark all forest spray booths so 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.730
 further who do not have enough money yet 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.820
 I strongly advise you to purchase this 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.190
 than paint without anything here 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.290
 such an ordinary hardware store any 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.930
 they are not there filters are replaceable and they have 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.320
 sold here take it quite its 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:38.740
 Lack of course not such a mask but quite 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:42.060
 enough it will build well and actually 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.270
 that's all thank you for your attention 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.680
 Take care of your health 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.360
 use individual means 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.020
 of protection 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.020
 good luck to all of you
