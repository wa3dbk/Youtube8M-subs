pictures<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:43.350> they<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.740> sort<00:03:44.070> all<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.340> these

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
pictures and they can sort all of these

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.660 
pictures and they can sort all of these
and<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.540> mean<00:03:45.860> great<00:03:46.860> idea<00:03:47.100> for<00:03:47.610> a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
and it's just I mean great idea for a
