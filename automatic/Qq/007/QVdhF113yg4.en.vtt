00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
so I've got 21 pots here I have 28

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.870 
so I've got 21 pots here I have 28
plants<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.810> will<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.590> will<00:02:16.130> only<00:02:16.310> plot<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.640> few

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
plants but I will I will only plot a few

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.510 
plants but I will I will only plot a few
up<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.830> video<00:02:19.100> because<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
up to to do for this video because you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.980 
up to to do for this video because you
don't<00:02:19.670> need<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.880> watch<00:02:20.030> me<00:02:20.209> plant<00:02:20.480> up<00:02:20.660> all<00:02:20.840> of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
don't need to watch me plant up all of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
don't need to watch me plant up all of
them

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
them

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.470 
them
so<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:26.350> seed<00:02:27.350> tray<00:02:27.770> oh<00:02:28.190> wow<00:02:29.180> they've

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
so with this seed tray oh wow they've

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.390 
so with this seed tray oh wow they've
got<00:02:29.600> some<00:02:29.810> nice<00:02:29.930> roots<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.740> here

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.730 

there's<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.490> big<00:02:34.700> hole<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.210> bottom<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.710> I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
there's a big hole in the bottom so I

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.950 
there's a big hole in the bottom so I
could<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.100> push<00:02:37.310> them<00:02:37.490> up<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:41.150> pardon

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
could just push them up actually pardon

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.560 
could just push them up actually pardon
me<00:02:42.140> I'm<00:02:42.320> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> grab<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> pencil<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> can<00:02:44.210> I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
me I'm going to grab a pencil so I can I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.120 
me I'm going to grab a pencil so I can I
could<00:02:45.050> poke<00:02:45.260> them<00:02:45.410> up<00:02:45.500> from<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.770> bottom<00:02:46.040> I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
could poke them up from the bottom I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.850 
could poke them up from the bottom I
don't<00:02:46.190> want<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.550> tear<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.850> at<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.420> root<00:02:47.600> system

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
don't want to tear it at the root system

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.780 
don't want to tear it at the root system
they're<00:02:48.860> still<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.310> young

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
they're still so young

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.120 
they're still so young
so<00:02:50.150> anyway<00:02:50.420> hold<00:02:51.020> up<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> moment<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.950> I'll

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
so anyway hold up for a moment and I'll

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.900 
so anyway hold up for a moment and I'll
be<00:02:52.250> right<00:02:52.400> back

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.680 

hey<00:02:55.910> there<00:02:56.120> got<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> pencil<00:02:56.750> eye<00:02:57.080> pen<00:02:57.560> actually

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
hey there got a pencil eye pen actually

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.110 
hey there got a pencil eye pen actually
so<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.840> will<00:02:59.990> make<00:03:00.110> life<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.440> lot<00:03:00.560> easier<00:03:01.120> just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
so this will make life a lot easier just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.800 
so this will make life a lot easier just
going<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.390> poke<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.840> up<00:03:03.050> from<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.320> bottom

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
going to poke this up from the bottom

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760 
going to poke this up from the bottom
grab<00:03:05.810> them<00:03:05.990> out<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:09.200> doesn't<00:03:09.440> really<00:03:09.530> have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
grab them out it doesn't really have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.040 
grab them out it doesn't really have
much<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.190> root<00:03:10.340> system<00:03:12.460> that's<00:03:13.460> alright

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
much of a root system that's alright

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.660 
much of a root system that's alright
just<00:03:15.050> going<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.290> stick<00:03:15.770> my<00:03:15.920> finger<00:03:15.950> down<00:03:16.430> in

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
just going to stick my finger down in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.720 
just going to stick my finger down in
there<00:03:17.890> I'm<00:03:18.890> going<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> try<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:21.610> support<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
there I'm going to try to support it the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.800 
there I'm going to try to support it the
best<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:24.820> try<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.880> keep<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.360> root<00:03:26.630> level

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
best I can try to keep the root level

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.440 
best I can try to keep the root level
the<00:03:27.080> same<00:03:27.320> height<00:03:28.130> as<00:03:28.160> vision<00:03:28.670> not<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
the same height as vision not in the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.110 
the same height as vision not in the
soil<00:03:29.780> here<00:03:32.890> they<00:03:33.890> seem<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.250> be<00:03:34.400> growing<00:03:34.790> about

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
soil here they seem to be growing about

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.930 
soil here they seem to be growing about
an<00:03:35.240> inch<00:03:35.450> down<00:03:38.140> make<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> little<00:03:39.380> hole<00:03:39.790> poke<00:03:40.790> it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
an inch down make a little hole poke it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.460 
an inch down make a little hole poke it
in<00:03:41.080> just<00:03:42.080> firm<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.500> soil<00:03:42.770> around<00:03:42.980> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.270 

easy-peasy

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.930 

ah

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.790 

these<00:03:57.510> really<00:03:57.810> don't<00:03:58.020> have<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> big<00:03:58.590> root

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
these really don't have a big root

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.340 
these really don't have a big root
system<00:03:59.160> I'm<00:03:59.340> surprised<00:03:59.760> at<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
system I'm surprised at that for the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.750 
system I'm surprised at that for the
amount<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.650> these<00:04:01.860> things<00:04:02.070> are<00:04:02.250> growing<00:04:02.460> I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
amount that these things are growing I

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.160 
amount that these things are growing I
thought<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.270> root<00:04:03.420> system<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:03.870> be<00:04:03.960> so

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
thought that the root system would be so

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.130 
thought that the root system would be so
much<00:04:04.350> larger<00:04:06.260> poke<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.410> down<00:04:07.530> in<00:04:07.770> there

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
much larger poke it down in there

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.840 
much larger poke it down in there
straighten<00:04:10.140> them<00:04:10.230> up<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:13.340> on<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.760> next

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
straighten them up and on to the next

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.280 
straighten them up and on to the next
one<00:04:16.670> this<00:04:17.670> is<00:04:17.820> one<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> first<00:04:18.299> ones<00:04:18.600> still

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
one this is one of the first ones still

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.430 
one this is one of the first ones still
see<00:04:19.790> it's<00:04:20.790> got<00:04:20.940> some<00:04:20.970> nice<00:04:21.269> white<00:04:21.690> roots<00:04:22.019> but

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
see it's got some nice white roots but

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.590 
see it's got some nice white roots but
not<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.100> lot<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> them<00:04:23.990> very<00:04:24.990> surprised

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
not a lot of them very surprised

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:39.900 
not a lot of them very surprised
make<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.630> hole<00:04:27.960> poke<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.680> down<00:04:28.830> in

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.280 

we're<00:04:40.450> just<00:04:40.540> going<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.720> repeat<00:04:41.050> this<00:04:41.230> process

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
we're just going to repeat this process

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
we're just going to repeat this process
for<00:04:42.040> all<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.280> them<00:04:42.990> I'll<00:04:43.990> pause<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.040> video<00:04:45.250> now

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
for all of them I'll pause the video now

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.880 
for all of them I'll pause the video now
and<00:04:45.670> I'll<00:04:46.660> come<00:04:46.930> back<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.260> I'll<00:04:47.320> have<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:47.740> of

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
and I'll come back and I'll have all of

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.970 
and I'll come back and I'll have all of
this<00:04:47.980> done<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:49.170> we'll<00:04:50.170> water<00:04:50.410> them<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:52.950> well<00:04:53.950> I

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
this done and we'll water them in well I

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.580 
this done and we'll water them in well I
got<00:04:54.250> everything<00:04:54.580> planted<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:56.170> turns<00:04:56.410> out

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
got everything planted and it turns out

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.550 
got everything planted and it turns out
that<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.800> had<00:04:56.980> 30<00:04:57.670> plants<00:04:57.970> not<00:04:58.300> 28<00:04:58.780> plants<00:04:59.230> some

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
that I had 30 plants not 28 plants some

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.050 
that I had 30 plants not 28 plants some
of<00:04:59.650> them<00:04:59.770> were<00:04:59.950> were<00:05:00.430> growing<00:05:00.760> out<00:05:00.880> at<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
of them were were growing out at the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.600 
of them were were growing out at the
bottom<00:05:01.420> of<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.990> tray<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.560> they<00:05:03.250> hadn't

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
bottom of the the tray and they hadn't

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.400 
bottom of the the tray and they hadn't
actually<00:05:03.790> come<00:05:04.210> up<00:05:04.240> through<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.990> surface

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
actually come up through the surface

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.410 
actually come up through the surface
like<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:06.040> one<00:05:06.280> here<00:05:06.670> there's<00:05:07.150> leaves

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
like this one here there's leaves

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.570 
like this one here there's leaves
hooking<00:05:08.020> around<00:05:08.140> but<00:05:08.560> they<00:05:08.890> haven't<00:05:09.430> reached

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
hooking around but they haven't reached

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.990 
hooking around but they haven't reached
the<00:05:09.730> surface<00:05:09.910> yet<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.720> planted<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:11.860> up

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
the surface yet so I planted that one up

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.880 
the surface yet so I planted that one up
one<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.120> them<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.300> broke<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.110> 29<00:05:14.410> plants

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
one of them I broke so I have 29 plants

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.330 
one of them I broke so I have 29 plants
all<00:05:14.980> together<00:05:15.280> which<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.240> fantastic<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:17.650> now

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
all together which is fantastic so now

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.920 
all together which is fantastic so now
I'm<00:05:18.520> going<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.820> water<00:05:19.300> these<00:05:19.540> in<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:21.930> while

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
I'm going to water these in and while

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.380 
I'm going to water these in and while
I'm<00:05:23.140> watering<00:05:23.530> it<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:23.950> I'm<00:05:24.640> going<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.210> be

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
I'm watering it in I'm going to be

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.550 
I'm watering it in I'm going to be
praying<00:05:25.690> for<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:26.110> bigger<00:05:26.320> home<00:05:27.570> so<00:05:28.570> that<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:28.990> can

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
praying for a bigger home so that I can

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.540 
praying for a bigger home so that I can
grow<00:05:29.950> these<00:05:31.920> because<00:05:32.920> I<00:05:32.950> don't<00:05:33.370> know<00:05:33.430> where

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
grow these because I don't know where

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.260 
grow these because I don't know where
I'm<00:05:33.670> going<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:33.880> put<00:05:33.970> all<00:05:34.030> of<00:05:34.150> them<00:05:36.270> I'll

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
I'm going to put all of them I'll

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.410 
I'm going to put all of them I'll
probably<00:05:38.550> grow<00:05:39.550> some<00:05:39.790> of<00:05:39.820> them<00:05:39.970> underneath<00:05:40.240> my

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
probably grow some of them underneath my

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.030 
probably grow some of them underneath my
grow<00:05:40.570> lights<00:05:40.840> I'll<00:05:41.110> probably<00:05:41.440> grow<00:05:41.740> some<00:05:42.010> of

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
grow lights I'll probably grow some of

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.630 
grow lights I'll probably grow some of
them<00:05:42.190> in<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> windowsills

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
them in the windowsills

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.220 
them in the windowsills
I'll<00:05:45.640> figure<00:05:45.940> something<00:05:46.300> out<00:05:46.480> give<00:05:46.990> me<00:05:47.050> some

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
I'll figure something out give me some

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.290 
I'll figure something out give me some
time<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:48.090> I'm<00:05:49.090> just<00:05:49.150> watering<00:05:49.540> these<00:05:49.720> in<00:05:49.900> well

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
time so I'm just watering these in well

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.000 
time so I'm just watering these in well
as<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.450> can<00:05:52.570> see<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.020> pink<00:05:53.350> elephant<00:05:53.500> is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
as you can see the pink elephant is

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.890 
as you can see the pink elephant is
really<00:05:54.400> no<00:05:54.550> longer<00:05:54.730> pink<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.510> more<00:05:55.780> of<00:05:55.840> a

updated<00:06:23.720> on<00:06:24.020> these<00:06:24.230> hopefully<00:06:25.220> they<00:06:25.370> all

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
updated on these hopefully they all

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.330 
updated on these hopefully they all
survive<00:06:26.050> like<00:06:27.050> I<00:06:27.199> said<00:06:27.440> the<00:06:27.650> root<00:06:27.919> systems

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
survive like I said the root systems

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.450 
survive like I said the root systems
aren't<00:06:28.669> as<00:06:28.760> big<00:06:28.910> as<00:06:29.030> I<00:06:29.150> thought<00:06:29.360> they<00:06:29.600> would<00:06:29.630> be

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
aren't as big as I thought they would be

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.050 
aren't as big as I thought they would be
but<00:06:32.199> that's<00:06:33.199> alright<00:06:33.560> these<00:06:34.100> these<00:06:34.669> plants

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
but that's alright these these plants

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.820 
but that's alright these these plants
tend<00:06:35.210> to<00:06:35.360> store<00:06:35.780> a<00:06:35.840> lot<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.229> moisture<00:06:36.590> in<00:06:36.770> the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
tend to store a lot of moisture in the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.210 
tend to store a lot of moisture in the
stems<00:06:37.669> so<00:06:38.510> root<00:06:38.960> systems<00:06:39.380> might<00:06:39.620> not<00:06:39.770> be<00:06:39.979> the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
stems so root systems might not be the

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.879 
stems so root systems might not be the
the<00:06:40.520> biggest<00:06:41.180> necessity<00:06:42.050> for<00:06:42.260> them<00:06:42.410> as<00:06:42.620> long

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
the biggest necessity for them as long

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.770 
the biggest necessity for them as long
as<00:06:43.010> the<00:06:43.100> leaves<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:43.610> the<00:06:43.669> stem<00:06:43.880> are<00:06:44.030> fine<00:06:44.270> I'm

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
as the leaves and the stem are fine I'm

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.159 
as the leaves and the stem are fine I'm
going<00:06:45.199> to<00:06:45.290> consider<00:06:45.590> them<00:06:45.770> healthy<00:06:47.169> until

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
going to consider them healthy until

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.340 
going to consider them healthy until
they<00:06:48.620> die<00:06:48.830> haha

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
they die haha

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.460 
they die haha
so<00:06:51.880> anyway<00:06:52.880> stay<00:06:53.180> tuned<00:06:53.419> for<00:06:53.690> more<00:06:53.870> updates

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
so anyway stay tuned for more updates

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.250 
so anyway stay tuned for more updates
there<00:06:54.650> will<00:06:54.919> be<00:06:54.950> more<00:06:56.050> happy<00:06:57.050> growing

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
there will be more happy growing

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.710 
there will be more happy growing
