00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.759
 today we talk about tomato purée 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.210
 because this is precisely the period 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.910
 best 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.030
 keep in mind that the decree law 157 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.170
 of 2004 reserved precisely the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.970
 denomination of tomato purée 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.670
 only to that product obtained from 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 direct pressing of fresh tomatoes 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 so you can't go wrong 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 on the contrary the products obtained with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 frozen tomato can no longer 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 use the denomination of passata 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 of tomato but must be 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.540
 marketed with national nations 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.790
 different as I don't know for example 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.059
 prepared for sauce or very tomato 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.059
 or all those tools here 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.940
 we say advertising that leads to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 think of tomato sauce but such 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 it's not the finished pulp products 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.719
 tomato can still be 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 derived from frozen raw material in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.699
 as much as this type of tomato 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 semi-finished product always made up of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 small octopus plus tomato juice 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 it is not regulated by law or by 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 regulations or specific regulations 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 be careful though if the packaging is in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.270
 metal, that is, in a jar, be careful 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 because on the outside they must not repeat not 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 there must be dents or 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.009
 bulges because these could 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.360
 give rise to rust when 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 bought a tomato puree 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 so prefer the packs in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.750
 glass bottles compared to others 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.490
 packs because you can check the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 color that gives indication of quality 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 it also allows you to check the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 consistency of the pass which must not 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.750
 to be but power or too much to what 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 in glass bottles they don't have to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.000
 be air bubbles and empty space 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 the cap should not be between the tomato 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.409
 excessive to the view for a long time 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.380
 important because it must oppose one 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 fair resistance to opening 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.180
 however to see if the pass of 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.829
 bottled tomato is absolutely 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.130
 integra that is not opened by 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.140
 no one just has to push the center of the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.210
 stopper if this is a click away 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.980
 means that he entered the area 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.860
 passed so it is no longer voted 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.050
 then discard it and maybe buy 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.210
 another package is always with the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.060
 test cap once the packaging 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.350
 it was opened by you of course it goes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.350
 stored in the refrigerator
