00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello, the company welcomes you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 producer developer jacks 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.309
 printers printbox3d 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.889
 in this video I will talk about the benefits 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 our new model printbox3d one let's start 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.920
 with that when we develop 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 guided by the principles that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.470
 modern 3d printer should be 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.770
 simple 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.539
 reliable and durable and accurate many 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 these features were missing from the printers 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 previous generations we used 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.230
 best engineers from the field of construction 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.989
 pages at machines robotics and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.480
 electronics and in the printer we reworked 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.649
 both mechanical elements and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 applied new technical solutions 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.620
 fundamental nature new 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 electronics and a fundamentally new approach 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 the first advantage we have to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 note that the plates are made in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 Russia and thanks to this you will 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.059
 provided with quality service 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.039
 warranty availability of spare consumables 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.500
 technical support materials 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.180
 learning that is a lot of this is not enough 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.239
 a printer that does not have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.650
 representative office in Russia 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.890
 now in order of technical 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.590
 Benefits Robust Frame Robust Frame 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.460
 made of 8mm aluminum then 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.530
 have this here we are all facing this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 the frame itself is very durable 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.869
 made of t-shaped design goal 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 on milled respectively 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 provides rigidity and accuracy 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.439
 thanks to this there is no 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.689
 backlash and and no printer maintains 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 transportation of moving from place to place 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.549
 the place is very important that is it is not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
 the designer is essentially due to such a frame 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.400
 and this approach to design 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.360
 such architecture 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.979
 printer is a desktop cnc machine 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.630
 second we applied a lot of new 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.340
 technical solutions that is, we do not 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530
 repelled by what we were 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.509
 reworked 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 analyzed the problems and 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.780
 accordingly applied new 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 technical solutions in the extruder 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.799
 the mechanism of pushing the thread in the system 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 heating and cooling 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.610
 control desk electronics and many 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.640
 other 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.190
 all this allowed us to make the printer more 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.130
 more accurate convenient and simple and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.160
 reliable naturally next important 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.200
 The moment is that when approaching 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.850
 the design of the printer was not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 principle of economy that is, we do not 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.680
 sought to replace the material with the most 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 Cheap we picked up the ones that 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.990
 will ensure maximum quality 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.390
 operation of the device that is most 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.390
 elements ranging from term sensors to hiccup 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.820
 There, ending with electronics, there are chips 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.160
 there are they very high class and 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.870
 correspond exactly to the machine cnc there 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.120
 than there any somehow 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.680
 designer items 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 most printer itself i 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.200
 we are about 20 there are elements of the body and 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.120
 various parts ie we produce 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 their own on high-precision CNC 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.870
 equipment that is it is milled and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170
 turning works 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.450
 thanks there is no plastic 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.220
 only metal luminello everything here 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 done precision it also 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.820
 affects the quality of work 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.440
 devices of its reliability that is there that 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:17.790
 there are all the items they are not plastic it 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.890
 all natural that affects you here 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 see the model and then the printer can 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.980
 print almost any type 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.370
 plastic that exists on 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.010
 moment of moment is important 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 what are the temperature modes of operation 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.209
 i.e. a powerful push system 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.680
 high pressure threads 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.969
 i.e 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.010
 plastics with any temperature 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.359
 modes can practically be 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.159
 used in this printer viz 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.180
 start by self spread pla 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.560
 which is safer and more efficient and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.829
 ending there high-temperature there 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.799
 nylon type plastics 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.540
 important point printing accuracy nozzle 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.060
 which is used on the printer but 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.040
 replaceable that is, you can wear 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.829
 absolutely any nozzles with different diameters 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.700
 holes i have basic variations this 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.620
 nozzle days there hole 0 3 millimeters 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.040
 precision nozzle 0 15 millimeter then 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.799
 there are 150 micron holes this again 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
 allowed by the fact that 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.579
 an extruder of this type works effectively 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.190
 no, that is essentially this part of it 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.740
 the basic know-how power of the printer that is with 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.650
 terms of technology thanks to not and 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.750
 as if we can already implement there and 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.320
 high-precision printing printing through 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.570
 small holes on the details no 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.699
 artifact gaps plastic shipped 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.870
 reliably and as if timely on the table 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.560
 summing up, that is, in these all 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.710
 elements allow you to get the very 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.970
 accuracy and convenience of the printer 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.979
 running on open source software 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.949
 ensuring that it comes in 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.570
 the kit can also be downloaded that is 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.250
 can be connected to completely different 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.470
 programs that support 3d 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.300
 print many of them in Russian 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.979
 we have already translated some 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.070
 have been translated ie it will all be 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.840
 very convenient and simple ie computer 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.310
 connects to the standard port and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.190
 after a small installation program 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.550
 you can exploit it thanks for 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.550
 Attention
