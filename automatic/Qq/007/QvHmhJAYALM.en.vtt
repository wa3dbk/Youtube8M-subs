00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
can you ever do ever try to repeat a

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.290 
can you ever do ever try to repeat a
favorite<00:00:40.589> background<00:00:41.039> it<00:00:41.699> seems<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.269> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
favorite background it seems like when I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.419 
favorite background it seems like when I
try<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.719> repeat<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.109> favorite<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.889> never<00:00:44.159> works

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
try and repeat a favorite it never works

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.709 
try and repeat a favorite it never works
out<00:00:44.579> quite<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> way<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.179> did<00:00:45.299> the<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.539> time

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
out quite the way it did the first time

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
out quite the way it did the first time
and<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.889> I<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:48.559> there's<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:49.679> real<00:00:49.859> rhyme<00:00:50.069> or

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and so I just there's no real rhyme or

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.129 
and so I just there's no real rhyme or
reason<00:00:50.339> I<00:00:50.549> don't<00:00:50.699> really<00:00:50.879> plan<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:52.109> I

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:52.139 
reason I don't really plan it I really I

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.979 
reason I don't really plan it I really I
really<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.979> feel<00:00:53.429> I<00:00:53.729> work<00:00:54.059> intuitively<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
really do feel I work intuitively and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
really do feel I work intuitively and
that<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.469> books<00:00:55.739> become<00:00:56.159> what<00:00:56.370> they're<00:00:56.519> going

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that my books become what they're going

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.969 
that my books become what they're going
to<00:00:56.760> become<00:00:57.199> when<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.229> get<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.619> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.799> point

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
to become when I get down to the point

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.500 
to become when I get down to the point
where<00:00:59.159> I'm<00:00:59.280> doing<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> actual<00:00:59.819> writing<00:01:00.389> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
where I'm doing the actual writing and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.689 
where I'm doing the actual writing and
some<00:01:00.659> things<00:01:00.839> like<00:01:00.929> that<00:01:01.049> then<00:01:01.889> it<00:01:02.219> becomes<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
some things like that then it becomes a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
some things like that then it becomes a
little<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.170> planned<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
little bit more planned out and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.930 
little bit more planned out and
methodical<00:01:04.620> but<00:01:05.190> doing<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.670> actual

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
methodical but doing the actual

up making for myself I always like the
best<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.820> I'll<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.900> first<00:01:43.280> that's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
best and I'll do that first that's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.890 
best and I'll do that first that's
normally<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.790> piece<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.750> WoW

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
normally the piece that's really the WoW

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.860 
normally the piece that's really the WoW
piece<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.670> try<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.000> work<00:01:48.420> backwards

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
piece and then I try and work backwards

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.790 
piece and then I try and work backwards
and<00:01:49.110> say<00:01:49.530> okay<00:01:50.370> this<00:01:51.060> piece<00:01:51.600> took<00:01:51.900> me<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.680> know

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
and say okay this piece took me you know

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.710 
and say okay this piece took me you know
seven<00:01:53.310> hours<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.510> kind

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
seven hours and I don't have that kind

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.649 
seven hours and I don't have that kind
of<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.230> what<00:01:55.860> step<00:01:56.220> can<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:56.670> either<00:01:57.240> speed

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of time so what step can I either speed

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410 
of time so what step can I either speed
up<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.229> another<00:01:58.560> product<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.280> what<00:01:59.909> step<00:02:00.210> can

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
up with another product or what step can

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.180 
up with another product or what step can
I<00:02:00.540> cut<00:02:01.080> out<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.440> eliminate<00:02:01.620> without

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
I cut out and eliminate without

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.340 
I cut out and eliminate without
affecting<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.760> overall<00:02:03.120> quality<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
affecting the overall quality and so I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.969 
affecting the overall quality and so I
kind<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> reverse<00:02:05.159> engineer<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
kind of reverse engineer and and then to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
kind of reverse engineer and and then to
a<00:02:08.459> lot<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> things<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.239> might<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.719> my

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
a lot of things that I might do in my

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.809 
a lot of things that I might do in my
home<00:02:10.019> studio<00:02:10.229> might<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> little<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.280> cost

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
home studio might be a little bit cost

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.930 
home studio might be a little bit cost
prohibitive<00:02:12.329> so<00:02:12.359> I<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.499> I<00:02:13.560> try<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:13.829> fine

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
prohibitive so I go and I try and fine

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
prohibitive so I go and I try and fine
really<00:02:15.630> nice<00:02:15.830> substitutions<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.190> work

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
really nice substitutions that will work

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.280 
really nice substitutions that will work
and<00:02:17.640> keep<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> cost<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> classes

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and keep the cost of the classes

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.780 
and keep the cost of the classes
affordable<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:20.250> great

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
affordable that's great

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.140 
affordable that's great
