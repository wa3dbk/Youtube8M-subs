beautiful<00:02:48.970> thing<00:02:49.180> would<00:02:49.989> would<00:02:50.350> make<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
beautiful thing would would make the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.550 
beautiful thing would would make the
sort<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.340> mash<00:02:51.670> infusion<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.020> then

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
sort of mash infusion like this and then

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.460 
sort of mash infusion like this and then
would<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.830> also<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.269> be<00:02:55.450> used<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.810> boil<00:02:56.200> up

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
would it also you be used to boil up

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.550 
would it also you be used to boil up
this<00:02:56.739> sweet<00:02:57.370> liquid<00:02:57.820> with<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.690> hops<00:02:59.019> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
this sweet liquid with the hops you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.680 
this sweet liquid with the hops you
throw<00:02:59.860> them<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.730> door<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.390> they

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
throw them in in the door there and they

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.410 
throw them in in the door there and they
would<00:03:01.870> give<00:03:02.050> bitterness<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.769> aroma<00:03:03.550> so<00:03:04.269> this

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
would give bitterness and aroma so this

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.840 
would give bitterness and aroma so this
is<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.750> mean<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.950> basis<00:03:06.550> of<00:03:06.700> all

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
is I mean this is a the basis of all

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.059 
is I mean this is a the basis of all
your<00:03:07.120> beer<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.080> see<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.440> extra

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
guarantee that the taste is same because

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.780 
guarantee that the taste is same because
