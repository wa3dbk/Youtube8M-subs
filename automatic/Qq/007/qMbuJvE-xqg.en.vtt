when<00:00:00.120> you<00:00:00.210> do<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.420> particular<00:00:00.810> squad<00:00:01.050> a

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
when you do this particular squad a

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.660 
when you do this particular squad a
limiting<00:00:02.010> factor<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.669> how<00:00:03.540> deep<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:04.020> can<00:00:04.230> go

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
limiting factor is how deep you can go

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.250 
limiting factor is how deep you can go
without<00:00:06.350> rotating<00:00:07.670> rotating<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:08.940> bad<00:00:09.269> if

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
without rotating rotating is not bad if

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
without rotating rotating is not bad if
you<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> rotate<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> go<00:00:11.280> down<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.599> all

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you have to rotate to go down and by all

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.720 
you have to rotate to go down and by all
means<00:00:14.330> do<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.790 

but<00:00:19.270> before<00:00:19.600> you<00:00:19.720> rotate<00:00:20.109> let's<00:00:20.350> go<00:00:20.500> over<00:00:20.710> the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
but before you rotate let's go over the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.589 
but before you rotate let's go over the
rotating<00:00:21.279> squad<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:22.150> reason<00:00:22.390> why<00:00:22.480> you<00:00:22.539> have

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
rotating squad the reason why you have

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.870 
rotating squad the reason why you have
to<00:00:22.720> rotate<00:00:22.960> is<00:00:23.259> because<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.650> need<00:00:23.830> one<00:00:24.490> leg<00:00:24.699> to

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
to rotate is because you need one leg to

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.640 
to rotate is because you need one leg to
go<00:00:25.000> through<00:00:25.210> what<00:00:25.300> they<00:00:25.330> call<00:00:25.650> external

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
go through what they call external

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.029 
go through what they call external
rotation<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.509> one-<00:00:28.509> oh<00:00:28.599> through<00:00:29.039> internal

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
rotation and one- oh through internal

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.519 
rotation and one- oh through internal
rotation<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:31.960> good

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
rotation this is good

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.860 
rotation this is good
why<00:00:32.800> because<00:00:33.220> anytime<00:00:33.430> I'm<00:00:34.239> going<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.660> turn

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
why because anytime I'm going to turn

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.549 
why because anytime I'm going to turn
left<00:00:35.170> I<00:00:35.500> got<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.550> externally<00:00:37.180> rotate<00:00:37.570> my<00:00:38.320> left

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
left I got the externally rotate my left

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.240 
left I got the externally rotate my left
foot<00:00:38.769> and<00:00:38.949> internally<00:00:39.640> rotate<00:00:40.000> my<00:00:40.540> right<00:00:40.780> foot

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
foot and internally rotate my right foot

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
foot and internally rotate my right foot
anytime<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:42.430> want<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.670> walk<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:43.089> the<00:00:43.180> right<00:00:43.330> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
anytime we want to walk to the right I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380 
anytime we want to walk to the right I
need<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:45.010> externally<00:00:45.489> rotate<00:00:45.519> my<00:00:45.910> right<00:00:45.940> foot

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
need to externally rotate my right foot

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.439 
need to externally rotate my right foot
and<00:00:46.949> then<00:00:47.949> internally<00:00:48.489> rotate<00:00:48.820> my<00:00:48.970> left<00:00:49.210> foot

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
and then internally rotate my left foot

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.590 
and then internally rotate my left foot
so<00:00:50.320> I<00:00:50.379> can<00:00:50.559> make<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> turn<00:00:50.980> we<00:00:51.640> do<00:00:51.789> rotation<00:00:52.420> all

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
so I can make a turn we do rotation all

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.510 
so I can make a turn we do rotation all
the<00:00:52.750> time<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.860> way<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.129> we<00:00:54.250> train

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
the time so the way that we train

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.000 
the time so the way that we train
ourselves<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.660> rotate<00:00:56.140> because<00:00:56.590> we<00:00:56.829> do<00:00:56.980> a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
ourselves to rotate because we do a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.369 
ourselves to rotate because we do a
rotating<00:00:57.609> squat<00:00:57.879> first<00:00:58.210> but<00:00:58.809> we<00:00:58.930> call<00:00:59.140> these

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
rotating squat first but we call these

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.540 
rotating squat first but we call these
ABC<00:01:00.039> squats<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.600> direction<00:01:02.140> be<00:01:02.260> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
ABC squats this direction be a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.310 
ABC squats this direction be a
misdirection<00:01:03.550> being<00:01:03.879> B<00:01:04.059> and<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:05.019> direction

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
misdirection being B and this direction

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.789 
misdirection being B and this direction
being<00:01:05.619> C<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:08.310> Hey

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.740 

see

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.670 

see<00:01:17.640> notice<00:01:18.640> one<00:01:19.450> side<00:01:19.480> internally<00:01:20.290> rotates

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
see notice one side internally rotates

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.410 
see notice one side internally rotates
and<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.070> other<00:01:21.220> side<00:01:21.400> externally<00:01:22.060> rotates

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
and the other side externally rotates

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.440 
and the other side externally rotates
this<00:01:22.990> will<00:01:23.230> help<00:01:23.380> us<00:01:23.590> develop<00:01:24.250> an<00:01:24.820> external<00:01:25.330> my

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
this will help us develop an external my

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.300 
this will help us develop an external my
internal<00:01:25.900> rotation<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.680> we<00:01:26.860> need<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.160> order

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
internal rotation that we need in order

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:38.020 
internal rotation that we need in order
to<00:01:27.430> do<00:01:27.640> our<00:01:28.500> overhead<00:01:29.850> squat

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.600 

now<00:01:38.510> on<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.780> next<00:01:38.930> exercise

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.970 

after<00:01:43.270> going<00:01:43.450> over<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.630> ABC<00:01:44.200> squats<00:01:44.500> we're

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
after going over the ABC squats we're

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.530 
after going over the ABC squats we're
going<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.190> go<00:01:45.280> over<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.640> internal<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
going to go over the internal and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to go over the internal and
external<00:01:46.630> rotational<00:01:47.590> squats<00:01:47.830> they<00:01:48.520> look<00:01:48.730> a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
external rotational squats they look a

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.160 
external rotational squats they look a
little<00:01:48.970> crazy<00:01:49.180> like<00:01:49.510> I'm<00:01:49.660> most<00:01:49.870> of<00:01:49.960> them<00:01:50.050> like

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
little crazy like I'm most of them like

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.000 
little crazy like I'm most of them like
the<00:01:50.290> Funky<00:01:50.620> Chicken

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
the Funky Chicken

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.530 
the Funky Chicken
but<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.610> thing<00:01:51.790> about<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.120> is<00:01:52.180> we<00:01:52.360> want<00:01:52.510> to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
but the thing about it is we want to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.180 
but the thing about it is we want to
make<00:01:52.660> sure<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.900> we<00:01:53.020> train<00:01:53.260> functionally<00:01:53.830> we

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
make sure that we train functionally we

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.650 
make sure that we train functionally we
want<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.430> train<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.790> same<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.180> way<00:01:55.330> that<00:01:55.510> we

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
want to train the same that way that we

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.050 
want to train the same that way that we
move<00:01:55.870> in<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.500> real<00:01:56.770> world<00:01:57.070> environment<00:01:57.700> so

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
move in the real world environment so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.460 
move in the real world environment so
we're<00:01:58.180> going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.330> internally<00:01:58.780> rotate<00:01:58.810> one

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
we're going to internally rotate one

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.620 
we're going to internally rotate one

let me show you something if I'm playing

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.270 
let me show you something if I'm playing
baseball<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.140> thing<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.769> before

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
baseball the one thing that I do before

baseball the one thing that I do before
I<00:02:20.459> hit<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> ball<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.590> internally<00:02:22.590> rotate<00:02:22.980> this

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
I hit the ball I internally rotate this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.559 
I hit the ball I internally rotate this
foot<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.640> order<00:02:26.849> for<00:02:26.940> me<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> hit<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> ball
