ones<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.850> they<00:02:44.940> work<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.269> the

them the one I did it on was this one
over<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.750> basically<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.590> dead

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
over here this is basically just a dead

end tunnel there's nothing down here is
what<00:02:59.940> we're<00:03:00.060> trying<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.269> do<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> gonna<00:03:00.630> get<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
what we're trying to do is gonna get a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320 
what we're trying to do is gonna get a
car<00:03:01.080> down<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.350> we're<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> flip<00:03:03.269> it

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
car down here we're going to flip it

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.180 
car down here we're going to flip it
over<00:03:03.570> right<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.350> we're<00:03:04.590> gonna<00:03:04.680> jump<00:03:05.040> on

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
over right here and we're gonna jump on

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.370 
over right here and we're gonna jump on
the<00:03:05.370> car<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.570> your<00:03:06.750> head<00:03:06.930> pops<00:03:07.170> up

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the car and then your head pops up

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.259 
the car and then your head pops up
through<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> ceiling<00:03:07.830> they<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.610> kill<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.060> if

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
through the ceiling they can kill you if

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.320 
through the ceiling they can kill you if
you<00:03:09.299> get<00:03:09.510> down<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:10.070> but<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.940> they're<00:03:12.120> above

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
you get down here but if they're above

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.479 
you get down here but if they're above
ground<00:03:12.570> they<00:03:12.780> don't<00:03:12.959> see<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> at<00:03:13.320> all<00:03:13.489> it's

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
ground they don't see it at all it's

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.830 
ground they don't see it at all it's
pretty<00:03:14.700> cool<00:03:17.180> all<00:03:18.180> right<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:18.570> I'm<00:03:18.690> getting

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
pretty cool all right now I'm getting

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.600 
pretty cool all right now I'm getting
the<00:03:19.019> car<00:03:19.230> down<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.620> tunnel<00:03:19.860> they<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.519> be

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the car down this tunnel they can be

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.500 
the car down this tunnel they can be
tricky<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:23.730> takes<00:03:24.060> longer<00:03:24.390> than

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
tricky right here it takes longer than

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.230 
tricky right here it takes longer than
it<00:03:24.690> probably<00:03:24.870> should<00:03:25.130> sometimes

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.740 

this<00:03:28.690> car<00:03:28.930> comes<00:03:29.110> back<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.560> hit<00:03:29.740> your<00:03:29.920> ass<00:03:29.980> and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
brings across a mat this bitch all right

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.460 
brings across a mat this bitch all right
I<00:03:42.580> finally<00:03:42.880> got<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.120> car<00:03:43.360> halfway<00:03:43.840> down<00:03:44.200> here

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
I finally got this car halfway down here

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.590 
I finally got this car halfway down here
now<00:03:44.620> goon<00:03:44.920> squad<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.340> over<00:03:45.520> there<00:03:45.670> kicking<00:03:46.480> it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
now goon squad is over there kicking it

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.960 
now goon squad is over there kicking it
to<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> right<00:03:46.960> side<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.430> can<00:03:48.550> get<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.760> fully

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
to the right side so we can get it fully

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.230 
to the right side so we can get it fully
under<00:03:50.250> now<00:03:51.250> there's<00:03:51.460> a<00:03:51.520> wall<00:03:51.760> bang<00:03:52.030> right

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
under now there's a wall bang right

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.970 
under now there's a wall bang right
there<00:03:52.330> too<00:03:52.660> sometimes<00:03:53.200> it'll<00:03:53.440> push<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.830> all

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
there too sometimes it'll push it all

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.680 
there too sometimes it'll push it all
the<00:03:54.010> way<00:03:54.160> through<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:54.730> you'll<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.300> above

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
the way through and you'll be up above

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.140 
the way through and you'll be up above
ground<00:03:56.100> but<00:03:57.100> usually<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.640> sticks<00:03:57.880> your<00:03:58.000> head

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
ground but usually just sticks your head

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.180 
ground but usually just sticks your head
through<00:04:00.180> all<00:04:01.180> right<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.500> jump<00:04:02.830> up<00:04:02.920> on<00:04:03.070> this

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
through all right so you jump up on this

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.860 
through all right so you jump up on this
car<00:04:03.430> when<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.820> there<00:04:04.000> did<00:04:04.240> you<00:04:04.270> got<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.630> stand

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
car when it's there did you got to stand

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.170 
car when it's there did you got to stand
up<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.110> be<00:04:05.320> doing<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.710> and<00:04:06.370> then<00:04:07.000> you'll<00:04:07.150> be

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
up to be doing it and then you'll be

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.410 
up to be doing it and then you'll be
bouncing<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.310> should<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.670> look<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.180> see<00:04:10.360> how

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
bouncing and should you look up see how

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.900 
bouncing and should you look up see how
it's<00:04:10.540> starting<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.870> push<00:04:11.020> me<00:04:11.200> through<00:04:14.910> claim

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
it's starting to push me through claim

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.300 
it's starting to push me through claim
it<00:04:16.060> takes<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.450> minute<00:04:16.750> get<00:04:17.650> your<00:04:17.830> guy<00:04:17.950> he'll

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
it takes a minute get your guy he'll

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.250 
it takes a minute get your guy he'll
quit<00:04:18.520> bouncing<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.370> shoot<00:04:21.670> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.420 

certain<00:04:26.260> areas<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.710> are<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:27.010> good<00:04:27.190> for

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
certain areas that are really good for

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.600 
certain areas that are really good for
it<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.470> figure<00:04:29.770> them<00:04:29.920> out<00:04:29.950> as<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.370> as<00:04:30.580> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
it and you figure them out as you as you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:43.550 
it and you figure them out as you as you
practice<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.930> it<00:04:35.350> did<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.740> sort<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.040> good

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.510 

all<00:04:44.560> right<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:44.890> we're<00:04:44.980> we<00:04:45.220> got<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.460> other

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
all right so we're we got the other

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.000 
all right so we're we got the other
tunnel<00:04:45.940> will<00:04:46.030> trying<00:04:46.270> this<00:04:46.390> one<00:04:46.600> out<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.830> see

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
tunnel will trying this one out and see

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.610 
tunnel will trying this one out and see
he<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:48.190> popped<00:04:48.580> right<00:04:48.730> through<00:04:49.620> right

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
he just popped right through right

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
he just popped right through right
through<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.030> floor<00:04:52.030> over<00:04:52.390> there<00:04:52.420> I'm<00:04:52.870> pretty

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
through the floor over there I'm pretty

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.920 
through the floor over there I'm pretty
sure<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.320> does<00:04:53.500> work<00:04:53.710> on<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:54.010> one<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:57.780> was<00:04:58.780> also

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
sure it does work on this one I was also

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.540 
sure it does work on this one I was also
thinking<00:04:59.110> there's<00:04:59.770> like<00:04:59.890> this<00:05:00.070> little<00:05:00.220> lot

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
thinking there's like this little lot

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.390 
thinking there's like this little lot
that<00:05:01.210> gate<00:05:01.480> over<00:05:01.750> there<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:02.170> some<00:05:02.860> steps<00:05:03.160> going

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
that gate over there to some steps going

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.340 
that gate over there to some steps going
down<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.790> might<00:05:03.910> be<00:05:04.060> able<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.270> go<00:05:05.080> through

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
down you might be able to go through

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.189 

basically<00:06:42.610> what<00:06:42.759> you<00:06:42.879> do<00:06:43.029> is<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.839> come<00:06:44.050> behind

basically what you do is you come behind

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.360 
basically what you do is you come behind
it<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:45.399> then<00:06:46.330> you<00:06:46.449> jump<00:06:47.019> up<00:06:47.199> there<00:06:47.259> and<00:06:47.709> you

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
it and then you jump up there and you

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.600 
it and then you jump up there and you
can<00:06:48.519> slide<00:06:48.849> up<00:06:49.269> the<00:06:49.509> tail<00:06:49.779> and<00:06:50.399> then<00:06:51.399> you<00:06:51.519> get

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
can slide up the tail and then you get

can slide up the tail and then you get
on<00:06:51.729> the<00:06:51.849> back<00:06:56.430> alright<00:06:57.430> so<00:06:57.580> if<00:06:57.669> they're

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
on the back alright so if they're

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.179 
on the back alright so if they're
humping<00:06:58.089> the<00:06:58.149> horses<00:06:58.689> but<00:06:58.959> for<00:06:59.319> about<00:06:59.529> five

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
humping the horses but for about five

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:01.589 
humping the horses but for about five
minutes<00:07:00.490> it's<00:07:00.729> a<00:07:00.879> really<00:07:00.999> not<00:07:01.120> that<00:07:01.240> hard<00:07:01.389> of<00:07:01.509> a

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
minutes it's a really not that hard of a

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.269 
minutes it's a really not that hard of a
jump<00:07:01.870> I<00:07:02.080> mean<00:07:02.379> it's<00:07:02.499> probably<00:07:02.740> the<00:07:02.919> hardest

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
jump I mean it's probably the hardest

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.519 
jump I mean it's probably the hardest
part<00:07:03.399> of<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.759> glitch<00:07:03.969> but<00:07:04.330> it's<00:07:05.199> really<00:07:05.379> not

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:05.529 
part of the glitch but it's really not

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.049 
part of the glitch but it's really not
too<00:07:05.589> bad<00:07:05.889> you<00:07:06.009> just<00:07:06.039> got<00:07:06.219> to<00:07:06.249> sort<00:07:06.430> of<00:07:06.580> grind<00:07:06.849> it

instead<00:07:24.620> of<00:07:24.830> set<00:07:24.949> the<00:07:24.980> camera<00:07:25.340> down<00:07:26.470> you<00:07:27.470> can

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
instead of set the camera down you can

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.430 
instead of set the camera down you can
jump<00:07:27.800> up<00:07:27.919> here<00:07:28.310> I<00:07:28.930> thought<00:07:29.930> it<00:07:30.260> would<00:07:30.320> be

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
jump up here I thought it would be

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.900 
jump up here I thought it would be
really<00:07:30.590> cool<00:07:30.740> if<00:07:30.979> you<00:07:31.340> could<00:07:31.460> just<00:07:31.520> keep

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
really cool if you could just keep

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.080 
really cool if you could just keep

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
running right here see there's a barrier

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.150 
running right here see there's a barrier
looks<00:07:35.090> like<00:07:35.270> you<00:07:35.419> can<00:07:35.630> but<00:07:36.229> you<00:07:36.260> can't<00:07:36.380> and<00:07:37.070> it

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 
looks like you can but you can't and it

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.700 
looks like you can but you can't and it

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
sucks with its put so pretty good

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.680 
sucks with its put so pretty good
sniping<00:07:40.070> spot<00:07:40.340> I<00:07:40.550> mean<00:07:40.729> you<00:07:40.790> can<00:07:40.940> go<00:07:40.970> sit<00:07:41.570> right

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.690

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590 
over there still a decent spot thought

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.939

it was pretty cool can also drop down on

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:55.659 
it was pretty cool can also drop down on
onto<00:07:51.949> that<00:07:53.830> can't<00:07:54.830> really<00:07:54.919> walk<00:07:55.130> around<00:07:55.460> there

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:55.669

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.150
