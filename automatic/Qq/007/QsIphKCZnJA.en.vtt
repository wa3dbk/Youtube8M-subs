buyer of aquariums is the designer look

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.679 
buyer of aquariums is the designer look
that<00:00:20.939> they<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:22.289> an<00:00:22.439> acrylic<00:00:22.710> tank<00:00:23.689> and

that they have is an acrylic tank and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.880 
that they have is an acrylic tank and
you<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> UM<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:28.320> tube<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
you can see the UM the tube in the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.240 
you can see the UM the tube in the
middle<00:00:29.840> it's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> lift<00:00:31.170> tube<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> bubbles

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
middle it's a lift tube for the bubbles

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
middle it's a lift tube for the bubbles
which<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.149> part<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> filtration<00:00:34.050> system

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
which is part of the filtration system

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.020 
which is part of the filtration system
and<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:37.469> intelligent<00:00:38.129> light<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.820> has

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and the intelligent light that this has

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.340 
and the intelligent light that this has
is<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:40.460> nice<00:00:41.460> interesting<00:00:42.180> feature<00:00:42.540> because

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is a nice interesting feature because

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.910 
is a nice interesting feature because
you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.620> set<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:45.300> length<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.140> daylight<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
you can set the length of daylight that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.010 
you can set the length of daylight that
you'd<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> aquarium<00:00:49.039> from<00:00:50.039> 8<00:00:51.020> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you'd like with this aquarium from 8 to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.250 
you'd like with this aquarium from 8 to
16<00:00:52.829> hours<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.379> five<00:00:55.980> hour

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
16 hours and as little as a five hour

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
16 hours and as little as a five hour
daylight<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.890> automatically<00:00:59.489> shuts<00:00:59.820> off

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
daylight and it automatically shuts off

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.130 
daylight and it automatically shuts off
and<00:01:00.449> goes<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:01.460> blue<00:01:02.460> LED<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and goes into blue LED like kind of a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
and goes into blue LED like kind of a
moonlight<00:01:04.710> effect<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.549> bubbles<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
moonlight effect the bubbles that you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240 
moonlight effect the bubbles that you
see<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> middle<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:10.100> part<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
see in the middle are part of the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
see in the middle are part of the
filtration<00:01:11.729> system<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.990> absorbs<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
filtration system and this absorbs the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.170 
filtration system and this absorbs the
waste<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> aquarium<00:01:18.150> from<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> fish<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
waste and the aquarium from the fish and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
waste and the aquarium from the fish and
here's<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.390> sponge<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.090> waste<00:01:25.049> goes

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
here's the sponge that the waste goes

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.550 
here's the sponge that the waste goes
into<00:01:26.270> well<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.340> pulls<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.689> water<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
into well this pulls the water and the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429 
into well this pulls the water and the
waste<00:01:31.740> down<00:01:32.040> into<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> substrate<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.439> which

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
waste down into the substrate here which

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.649 
waste down into the substrate here which
are<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> combination<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:37.400> ceramic

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
are a combination of the ceramic

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
are a combination of the ceramic
material<00:01:39.740> which<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:40.950> porous<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
material which is very porous and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.770 
material which is very porous and
provides<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:43.430> biological<00:01:44.430> substrate<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
provides a biological substrate the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
provides a biological substrate the
tough<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.229> merely<00:01:46.590> decorative<00:01:46.920> rocks<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
tough is merely decorative rocks that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.319 
tough is merely decorative rocks that
were<00:01:47.970> added<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
were added and right now I'm using just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.429 
were added and right now I'm using just
plastic<00:01:51.720> plants

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
plastic plants

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.359 
plastic plants
I<00:01:52.979> may<00:01:53.189> change<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.360> using<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.530> live<00:01:55.740> plants

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I may change this using some live plants

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.910 
I may change this using some live plants
which<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.790> help<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> balance<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.640> water

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
which will help to balance the water

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
which will help to balance the water
chemistry<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.219> look<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.520> by<00:02:02.909> absorbing

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
chemistry will look better by absorbing

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
chemistry will look better by absorbing
nutrients<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.350> preventing<00:02:04.799> algae<00:02:05.219> from

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
nutrients and preventing algae from

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.429 
nutrients and preventing algae from
growing

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
growing

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.390 
growing
