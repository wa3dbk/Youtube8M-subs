the wrong reason in my prediction video

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
from it mmm basically the early rounds

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.999 
from it mmm basically the early rounds
it<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.200> forth<00:01:10.440> i<00:01:10.830> had

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
it was a lot of back and forth i had

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.950 
it was a lot of back and forth i had
trout<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.940> round<00:01:12.210> Canelo<00:01:12.720> in

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
trout one in the first round Canelo in

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.760 
trout one in the first round Canelo in
the<00:01:13.170> second<00:01:13.920> round<00:01:14.360> third<00:01:15.360> rounds<00:01:16.110> could<00:01:16.680> have

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the second round third rounds could have

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.109 
the second round third rounds could have
went<00:01:16.890> either<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.190> fourth<00:01:18.090> room<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:19.170> thought

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
went either way fourth room I thought

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.310 
went either way fourth room I thought
trout<00:01:21.119> might<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.450> pulled<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:24.320> from

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
trout might have pulled it out but from

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
trout might have pulled it out but from
what<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.590> saw<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.190> looked<00:01:26.399> like<00:01:26.520> Austin<00:01:27.119> trout

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
what I saw it looked like Austin trout

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
what I saw it looked like Austin trout
definitely<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.200> rounds<00:01:28.789> that<00:01:29.789> were

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
definitely one more rounds that were

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
definitely one more rounds that were
rounds<00:01:30.300> when<00:01:30.420> Canelo<00:01:30.930> Alvarez<00:01:31.289> basically

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
rounds when Canelo Alvarez basically

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.430 
rounds when Canelo Alvarez basically
just<00:01:32.310> took<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> round<00:01:32.880> off<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:34.110> would<00:01:34.229> tell

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
just took the round off that would tell

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.109 
just took the round off that would tell
him<00:01:34.649> he<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.039> laying<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.580> ropes<00:01:35.789> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
him he was just laying on the ropes just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
him he was just laying on the ropes just
bobbing<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> weaving<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.110> throwing<00:01:37.470> no

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
bobbing and weaving and I throwing no

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
bobbing and weaving and I throwing no
punches<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:38.600> which<00:01:39.600> shows<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
punches back which shows me that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.279 
punches back which shows me that
Canelo's<00:01:41.720> stamina<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
Canelo's stamina that's not what it

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.200 
Canelo's stamina that's not what it
should<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:44.580> it<00:01:44.789> was<00:01:44.910> because<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
should be now maybe it was because of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
should be now maybe it was because of
those<00:01:45.390> body<00:01:45.660> shots<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.170> he<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.380> getting<00:01:46.500> hit

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
those body shots that he was getting hit

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.169 
those body shots that he was getting hit
with<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:48.560> what<00:01:49.560> lost<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:50.099> for<00:01:50.459> Canelo<00:01:50.789> in<00:01:51.060> my

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
with but what lost it for Canelo in my

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.580 
with but what lost it for Canelo in my
opinion<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.720> he<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.990> wasn't<00:01:52.200> busy<00:01:52.560> enough

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
opinion was he just wasn't busy enough

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
opinion was he just wasn't busy enough
he<00:01:53.280> gave<00:01:53.520> rounds<00:01:53.940> away<00:01:55.190> he<00:01:56.190> threw<00:01:57.179> less

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
he gave rounds away he threw less

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.729 
he gave rounds away he threw less
punches<00:01:57.929> than<00:01:58.130> trout<00:01:59.300> and<00:02:00.349> I<00:02:01.349> think<00:02:01.560> another

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
punches than trout and I think another

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.919 
punches than trout and I think another
reason<00:02:01.979> why<00:02:02.190> he<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.459> getting<00:02:02.700> tired<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.690> cuz

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
reason why he was getting tired was cuz

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.809 
reason why he was getting tired was cuz
cannella<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.709> missing<00:02:05.069> a<00:02:05.099> lot<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.369> shots<00:02:05.550> see

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
cannella was missing a lot of shots see

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.940 
cannella was missing a lot of shots see
when<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.330> when<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> boxing<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.709> when<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
when you when you boxing and when you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029 
when you when you boxing and when you
throw<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> punch<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.599> miss<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.590> takes<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
throw a punch and you miss that takes a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.890 
throw a punch and you miss that takes a
lot<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> more<00:02:11.760> energy<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.750> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
lot of more energy out of you then if

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.740 
lot of more energy out of you then if
you<00:02:13.020> land<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.349> punch<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.450> from<00:02:15.599> all

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you land a punch and I think from all

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.150 
you land a punch and I think from all
those<00:02:15.870> shots<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.410> he<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.620> missing<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
those shots that he was missing that

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.059 
those shots that he was missing that
drained<00:02:17.430> his<00:02:17.580> energy<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:21.590> basically<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.920> me

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
drained his energy and basically see me

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.199 
drained his energy and basically see me
and<00:02:23.160> my<00:02:23.220> dad<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.610> were<00:02:23.700> watching<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.060> fight

basically gave himself no credit he

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.020 
basically gave himself no credit he
basically<00:02:58.469> just<00:02:58.560> said<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:59.280> Canelo<00:02:59.640> was<00:02:59.909> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
basically just said that Canelo was the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.970 
basically just said that Canelo was the
better<00:03:00.239> man<00:03:00.359> that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.920 

and<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.129> he<00:03:04.280> will<00:03:04.430> be<00:03:04.459> back<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.060> he<00:03:05.629> wants<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and that he will be back and he wants a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.410 
and that he will be back and he wants a
rematch<00:03:06.109> but<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.549> was<00:03:07.700> trout<00:03:08.000> i'm<00:03:08.150> going<00:03:08.329> to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
rematch but if I was trout i'm going to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.410 
rematch but if I was trout i'm going to
told<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.170> truth<00:03:09.379> in<00:03:09.650> because<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.879> trout

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
told the truth in because I know trout

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.440 
told the truth in because I know trout
knows<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:11.870> he<00:03:11.959> won<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.349> fight<00:03:12.969> but<00:03:13.969> I<00:03:14.239> guess

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
knows that he won that fight but I guess

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.259 
knows that he won that fight but I guess
maybe<00:03:15.219> maybe<00:03:16.219> he<00:03:16.430> didn't<00:03:16.609> want<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> crowd<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
maybe maybe he didn't want the crowd the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.129 
maybe maybe he didn't want the crowd the
boom<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> guess<00:03:18.170> maybe<00:03:18.439> he<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:18.680> decided<00:03:19.280> to

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
boom so I guess maybe he just decided to

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.080 
boom so I guess maybe he just decided to
to<00:03:21.139> just<00:03:21.170> give<00:03:21.620> condone<00:03:22.280> all<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.609> credit<00:03:22.969> even

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
to just give condone all the credit even

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.899 
to just give condone all the credit even
though<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.540> my<00:03:23.659> opinion<00:03:24.219> if<00:03:25.219> I<00:03:25.430> was<00:03:25.700> awesome

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
though in my opinion if I was awesome

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.360 
though in my opinion if I was awesome
child<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.359> would<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.629> said<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.099> was

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
118 109 for Canelo that's ridiculous I

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.940 
118 109 for Canelo that's ridiculous I

even<00:04:12.459> though<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.580> predict<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.239> Canelo<00:04:13.599> will

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
even though I predict that Canelo will

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.469 
even though I predict that Canelo will
win<00:04:14.140> in<00:04:14.500> my<00:04:14.950> prediction<00:04:15.430> video<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:17.260> didn't<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
win in my prediction video it didn't I

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.870 
win in my prediction video it didn't I
mean<00:04:19.560> he<00:04:20.560> won<00:04:20.769> but<00:04:21.040> he<00:04:21.070> he<00:04:21.310> shouldn't<00:04:21.639> have<00:04:21.669> one

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
mean he won but he he shouldn't have one

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.100 
mean he won but he he shouldn't have one
