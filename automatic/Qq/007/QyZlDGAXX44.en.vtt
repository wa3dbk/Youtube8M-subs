these rails here they are actually
floating<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.049> there<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.190> minecarts

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
floating and there is some minecarts

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.689 
floating and there is some minecarts
actually<00:00:18.330> repeatedly<00:00:18.920> going<00:00:19.920> across<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
want to do this is is you first off want

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
want to do this is is you first off want
to<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> rails<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
to get the rails you want to get a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
to get the rails you want to get a
minecart<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.439> either<00:00:31.619> a

absolute like you you got to hit the
bottom<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.540> double<00:01:33.869> tall<00:01:34.079> grass<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.650> this

bottom of the double tall grass for this

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340 
bottom of the double tall grass for this
to<00:01:34.950> work<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:36.060> it'll<00:01:37.020> actually

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to work and if you don't it'll actually

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
to work and if you don't it'll actually
mess<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> track<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> track<00:01:38.939> will

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mess up the track and the track will

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
mess up the track and the track will
fall<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> again

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fall but you can actually do it again

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
fall but you can actually do it again
you<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> repeat<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you just have to repeat you know the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.850 
you just have to repeat you know the
steps<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> glitch<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.210> anyways

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
steps to this glitch but now anyways

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.770
