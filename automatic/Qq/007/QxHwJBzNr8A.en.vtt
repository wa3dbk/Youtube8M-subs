00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the end it was good so I think that we

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.550 
the end it was good so I think that we
missed<00:02:50.550> only<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:50.910> goal<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.360> with<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.260> vault

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
missed only one goal and with one vault

just<00:03:46.350> one<00:03:46.560> win<00:03:46.799> will<00:03:47.070> open<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.030> minds<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:50.360> it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
just one win will open the minds and it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.199 
just one win will open the minds and it

it<00:04:01.350> will<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.739> much<00:04:01.920> easier<00:04:01.950> for<00:04:02.459> them<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.640> play

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and to win the games so I know that it's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.490 
and to win the games so I know that it's
always<00:04:09.360> difficult<00:04:09.570> when<00:04:09.900> you're<00:04:10.200> starting

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
always difficult when you're starting

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.830 
always difficult when you're starting
new<00:04:11.160> season<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.959> lot<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.140> new<00:04:13.290> players<00:04:13.549> but<00:04:14.840> for

new season a lot of new players but for

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.500 
new season a lot of new players but for
this<00:04:16.080> time<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.739> show<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.060> thing

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
this time of the show I think this thing

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.420 
this time of the show I think this thing
will<00:04:18.690> be<00:04:18.870> better<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.229> better<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.890> we'll<00:04:20.130> go

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
will be better and better and we'll go

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.450 
will be better and better and we'll go
