00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
without having to do a lot of

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.590 
without having to do a lot of
unnecessary<00:00:59.339> work<00:01:01.729> if<00:01:02.729> this<00:01:02.939> kerf<00:01:03.330> weather

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
unnecessary work if this kerf weather

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
unnecessary work if this kerf weather
strip<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> old<00:01:04.320> which<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> brand<00:01:05.369> new

strip is old which this is brand new

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
strip is old which this is brand new
then<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.720> would<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.080> best<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.619> ahead<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then it would be best to go ahead and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.560 
then it would be best to go ahead and
replace<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.960> because<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.290> hard<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> adjust

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
replace it because it's hard to adjust

not<00:03:16.740> sealing<00:03:17.190> all<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.610> way<00:03:17.730> against<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.240> door

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
not sealing all the way against the door

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.860 
not sealing all the way against the door
but<00:03:19.440> if<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.710> were<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.060> push<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.270> door<00:03:21.480> closed

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
just a little bit more which means

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.690 
just a little bit more which means
adjusting<00:03:27.710> just<00:03:28.710> in<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> structure<00:03:29.490> for

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
adjusting just in the structure for

adjusting just in the structure for
either<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:31.140> deadbolt<00:03:31.560> or<00:03:31.830> your<00:03:31.980> regular

either the deadbolt or your regular

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.860 
either the deadbolt or your regular
latch<00:03:32.550> which<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.090> would<00:03:33.270> be<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.690> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
latch which this would be the one to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.410 
latch which this would be the one to
adjust<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.460> have<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> adjust<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.210> one

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
adjust and you have to adjust this one

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.470 
adjust and you have to adjust this one

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
to fit that but let's say that you can't

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.240 
to fit that but let's say that you can't
move<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.840> any<00:03:39.990> more<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.940> we<00:03:41.940> want<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.240> fix<00:03:42.450> that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
move it any more and we want to fix that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.530

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.480 
stick it back in in other words you've
got<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.490> little<00:04:02.820> gap<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:04.670> between<00:04:05.670> your<00:04:07.490> your

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
got a little gap in between your your

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.460 
got a little gap in between your your
jamb<00:04:08.820> stop<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.540> your<00:04:09.720> weather<00:04:10.500> strip

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.460 

we<00:04:17.470> close<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.919> door<00:04:18.100> we<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.400> not<00:04:18.579> adjusted

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
we close the door we have not adjusted

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.800 
we close the door we have not adjusted
we<00:04:20.470> have<00:04:20.650> not<00:04:20.829> adjusted<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.430> locks<00:04:21.810> or

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
we have not adjusted the locks or

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.670 
we have not adjusted the locks or
anything<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.840> we<00:04:25.990> fixed<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.780> air<00:04:28.960> gap<00:04:29.289> at<00:04:29.620> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
anything but we fixed the air gap at the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.379 
anything but we fixed the air gap at the
top<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.729> now<00:04:30.759> we<00:04:30.970> have<00:04:31.300> no<00:04:32.789> no<00:04:33.789> light<00:04:34.030> coming

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
top so now we have no no light coming

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.600 
top so now we have no no light coming
into<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.750> bottle<00:04:35.229> top<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.740> no<00:04:36.100> light<00:04:36.310> coming

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
into the bottle top and no light coming

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.189 
into the bottle top and no light coming
in<00:04:36.789> at<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.000> bottom<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:37.630> that's<00:04:37.870> going<00:04:38.139> to

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
in at the bottom so that's going to

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.120 
in at the bottom so that's going to
pretty<00:04:38.440> much<00:04:38.530> seal<00:04:38.979> our<00:04:39.220> weather<00:04:39.400> strip<00:04:39.820> but
