00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
sections as big clumps right look at how

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.470 
sections as big clumps right look at how
this<00:00:12.740> is<00:00:12.950> radiating<00:00:13.519> out<00:00:13.730> like<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.209> but

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
this is radiating out like this but

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.630 
this is radiating out like this but
really<00:00:14.929> that's<00:00:15.110> like<00:00:15.349> one<00:00:15.559> big<00:00:15.799> shape<00:00:16.340> through

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
really that's like one big shape through

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.939 
really that's like one big shape through
there<00:00:16.820> another<00:00:17.510> one<00:00:17.750> other<00:00:18.320> one<00:00:18.440> through<00:00:18.650> here

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
there another one other one through here

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.340 
there another one other one through here
so<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.940> shapes<00:00:20.270> are<00:00:20.480> varied<00:00:20.840> all<00:00:21.020> through

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
so the shapes are varied all through

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.420 
so the shapes are varied all through
here<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.770> they're<00:00:21.890> all<00:00:22.010> going<00:00:22.190> different

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
here and they're all going different

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.510

kind of grows out like that then at the
same<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.870> my<00:03:27.170> part<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:28.250> my<00:03:28.430> hair<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:29.030> can

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actually mass that out so it now when I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830 
actually mass that out so it now when I
start<00:03:33.080> sculpting<00:03:33.380> out<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.910> way<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.660> big

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
start sculpting out this way it's a big

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.470 
start sculpting out this way it's a big
part<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.769> hair<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.519> could<00:03:37.880> decrease

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
part in the hair so I could decrease

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.500 
part in the hair so I could decrease
that<00:03:38.540> just<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.200> little<00:03:39.410> bit<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.700> look<00:03:41.299> at<00:03:41.390> where

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
that just a little bit so look at where

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.150 
that just a little bit so look at where
the<00:03:41.600> center<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.019> look<00:03:42.470> where<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.709> part<00:03:42.980> is

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
the center is look where the part is

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.479 
the center is look where the part is
right<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.060> then<00:03:44.660> also<00:03:44.989> think<00:03:45.650> about<00:03:45.739> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
right and then also think about the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.880 
right and then also think about the
direction<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.150> hair<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.720> you've<00:03:48.170> got<00:03:48.200> this

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
direction of the hair so you've got this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.400 
direction of the hair so you've got this
that<00:03:49.160> comes<00:03:49.340> down<00:03:49.549> here<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.630> hair<00:03:50.870> style

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
that comes down here is the hair style

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.620 
that comes down here is the hair style
going<00:03:51.739> back<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.100> way<00:03:52.310> does<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.549> start<00:03:52.940> here

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
going back this way does it start here

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.199 
going back this way does it start here
and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:53.840> come<00:03:54.500> out<00:03:54.860> now<00:03:55.459> remember<00:03:55.730> if<00:03:56.060> it

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
and then come out now remember if it

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.390 
and then come out now remember if it
starts<00:03:56.239> here<00:03:57.110> this<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.739> going<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:57.980> lay<00:03:58.130> over

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
starts here this is going to lay over

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.910 
starts here this is going to lay over
top<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.730> all<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.420> stuff<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.410> really<00:04:00.650> when

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
top of all this stuff so really when

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.800 
top of all this stuff so really when
you're<00:04:01.040> doing<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.280> hairstyle<00:04:01.820> it's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.510> little

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
you're doing a hairstyle it's a little

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.080 
you're doing a hairstyle it's a little
counterintuitive<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.859> terms<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.880> should

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
counterintuitive in terms of you should

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.759 
counterintuitive in terms of you should
be<00:04:05.209> starting<00:04:05.600> from<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> bottom<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.440> head

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.170 

so<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.799> should<00:04:10.250> be<00:04:10.400> starting<00:04:10.820> at<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.940> bottom

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so you should be starting at the bottom

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.210 
so you should be starting at the bottom
and<00:04:12.880> then<00:04:13.880> layering<00:04:14.299> over<00:04:15.260> top<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.950> come

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and then layering over top as you come

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.009 
and then layering over top as you come
up<00:04:16.250> over<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.180> way<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:18.049> hair<00:04:19.900> feels<00:04:20.900> like

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
up over so that way the hair feels like

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.750 
up over so that way the hair feels like
it's<00:04:21.260> actually<00:04:21.560> getting<00:04:21.769> layered<00:04:22.130> over<00:04:22.400> top

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's actually getting layered over top

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.460 
it's actually getting layered over top
of<00:04:22.789> it<00:04:23.000> if<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.390> start<00:04:23.630> from<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.870> top<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.110> try

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
of it if you start from the top and try

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.409 
of it if you start from the top and try
and<00:04:24.530> work<00:04:24.710> your<00:04:24.830> way<00:04:24.890> down<00:04:24.979> it<00:04:25.850> doesn't<00:04:26.270> work

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
and work your way down it doesn't work

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.450 
and work your way down it doesn't work
so<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.110> can<00:04:27.200> get<00:04:27.289> some<00:04:27.470> kind<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.740> nicer<00:04:28.100> soft

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
so you can get some kind of nicer soft

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.000 
so you can get some kind of nicer soft
smaller<00:04:29.030> stuff<00:04:29.419> happening<00:04:30.380> underneath<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
smaller stuff happening underneath and

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.460 
smaller stuff happening underneath and
then<00:04:31.180> come<00:04:32.180> over<00:04:32.210> top<00:04:32.630> with<00:04:32.870> some<00:04:33.200> bigger

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
then come over top with some bigger

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.360 
then come over top with some bigger
pieces<00:04:36.039> and<00:04:37.039> change<00:04:37.700> this<00:04:38.000> change<00:04:38.419> my<00:04:39.140> vocal

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
pieces and change this change my vocal

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.439 
pieces and change this change my vocal
a<00:04:41.810> work<00:04:42.810> big<00:04:43.350> too<00:04:44.190> small<00:04:44.370> I'm<00:04:44.940> gonna<00:04:45.090> get<00:04:45.300> go<00:04:45.419> a

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
a work big too small I'm gonna get go a

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.140 
a work big too small I'm gonna get go a
little<00:04:45.630> smaller<00:04:48.139> /<00:04:49.139> here<00:04:49.820> maybe<00:04:50.820> around<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
little smaller / here maybe around the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.240 
little smaller / here maybe around the
face<00:04:51.389> i'm<00:04:51.660> going<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.870> go<00:04:51.990> little<00:04:52.860> smaller

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
face i'm going to go little smaller

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.610 
face i'm going to go little smaller
strokes<00:04:53.760> but<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:54.870> i'm<00:04:55.229> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.410> come<00:04:55.590> over

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
strokes but then i'm going to come over

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.879 
strokes but then i'm going to come over
top<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:58.370> this<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.580> more<00:05:00.229> again<00:05:01.229> sculptural

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
top and this is more again sculptural

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:16.519 
top and this is more again sculptural
hair<00:05:12.830> and

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529

anything<00:05:17.009> in<00:05:17.449> I'm<00:05:18.449> going<00:05:18.569> to<00:05:18.659> go<00:05:18.749> back<00:05:18.779> to<00:05:18.959> that

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:19.109 
anything in I'm going to go back to that

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:25.489 
anything in I'm going to go back to that
point<00:05:21.649> and<00:05:22.649> remember<00:05:23.009> hair<00:05:23.399> is<00:05:23.519> layered<00:05:24.499> so

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:25.499 
point and remember hair is layered so

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.229 
point and remember hair is layered so
pay<00:05:26.219> attention<00:05:26.249> the<00:05:26.729> next<00:05:26.909> time<00:05:27.029> you<00:05:27.089> get<00:05:27.209> a

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:27.239 
pay attention the next time you get a

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.939 
pay attention the next time you get a

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:40.159 
haircut and see how they layer your hair
they<00:05:29.369> cut<00:05:29.639> it<00:05:29.669> from<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:29.969> bottom<00:05:30.299> here<00:05:30.509> up<00:05:39.169> so

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
they cut it from the bottom here up so

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.299 
they cut it from the bottom here up so
I'm<00:05:40.229> going<00:05:40.379> to<00:05:40.409> take<00:05:40.589> away<00:05:40.829> a<00:05:40.859> little<00:05:41.069> bit<00:05:41.159> of

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
I'm going to take away a little bit of

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:59.700 
I'm going to take away a little bit of
the<00:05:41.369> mask<00:05:41.609> here

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.100 

strokes<00:06:00.160> especially<00:06:00.730> for<00:06:00.940> hair<00:06:01.150> kind<00:06:01.990> of

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
strokes especially for hair kind of

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.920 
strokes especially for hair kind of
create<00:06:02.890> other<00:06:03.250> strokes<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:04.630> know<00:06:04.660> as<00:06:04.900> you

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
create other strokes you know as you

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.830 
create other strokes you know as you
could<00:06:05.320> have<00:06:05.410> mash<00:06:05.620> these<00:06:05.860> together<00:06:09.600> but<00:06:10.600> think

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
could have mash these together but think

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:25.290 
could have mash these together but think
of<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.080> as<00:06:11.230> hair<00:06:11.770> clumps<00:06:16.470> come<00:06:17.470> back<00:06:17.650> here<00:06:24.300> just

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
of it as hair clumps come back here just

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.590 
of it as hair clumps come back here just
came<00:06:25.540> back<00:06:25.690> here<00:06:26.260> and<00:06:26.470> then<00:06:26.650> and<00:06:27.550> change<00:06:28.540> your

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
came back here and then and change your

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.950 
came back here and then and change your
brush<00:06:28.840> stroke<00:06:29.140> size<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:33.600> then<00:06:34.600> if<00:06:34.720> you<00:06:34.810> want

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
brush stroke size and then if you want

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.210 
brush stroke size and then if you want
to

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
to

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.190 
to
shape<00:06:35.640> later<00:06:35.880> on<00:06:36.060> go<00:06:36.330> back<00:06:36.510> down<00:06:36.960> to<00:06:36.990> your

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
shape later on go back down to your

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.400 
shape later on go back down to your
lower<00:06:37.410> level<00:06:37.760> go<00:06:38.760> down<00:06:38.790> here<00:06:39.480> pull<00:06:39.870> it<00:06:39.990> out<00:06:40.140> and

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
lower level go down here pull it out and

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:48.410 
lower level go down here pull it out and
then<00:06:41.990> go<00:06:42.990> back<00:06:43.020> up<00:06:43.440> and<00:06:43.740> refine<00:06:46.880> so<00:06:47.880> it's<00:06:48.300> my

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
then go back up and refine so it's my

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.110 
then go back up and refine so it's my
little<00:06:48.570> hair<00:06:48.810> demo
