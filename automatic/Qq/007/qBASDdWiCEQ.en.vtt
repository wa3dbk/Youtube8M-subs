when I'm walking in the woods or when I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.109 
when I'm walking in the woods or when I

something in that spot and I placed a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
something in that spot and I placed a
compass<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.689> looks<00:01:36.810> pretty

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
compass and I don't know it looks pretty

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
compass and I don't know it looks pretty
good<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.450> end<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.950> wrist

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
good on the other end I have a wrist

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
good on the other end I have a wrist
sling<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.960> when<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.259> casting<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> don't

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
