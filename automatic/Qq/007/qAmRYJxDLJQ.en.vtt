00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
inside the egg will fall out and it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
inside the egg will fall out and it's
gonna<00:01:14.400> trigger<00:01:14.670> though<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.390> system

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
gonna trigger though in your system

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
gonna trigger though in your system
