00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
on a different texture pack and this is

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.370 
on a different texture pack and this is
the<00:02:48.350> Lego<00:02:49.040> one<00:02:49.340> which<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:49.940> pretty<00:02:50.930> cool<00:02:51.140> like

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
the Lego one which it's pretty cool like

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.910 
the Lego one which it's pretty cool like
the<00:02:51.470> crafting<00:02:51.830> table<00:02:51.890> says<00:02:52.310> Lego<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.920> it's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the crafting table says Lego on it it's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.910 
the crafting table says Lego on it it's
pretty<00:02:55.190> much<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.530> that's<00:02:57.650> kind<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
pretty much but I think that's kind of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.840 
pretty much but I think that's kind of
thing<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.700> looks<00:02:58.850> kind<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.150> cool<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.850> yeah

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
thing that looks kind of cool and yeah

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.330 
thing that looks kind of cool and yeah
it's<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.300> actually<00:03:02.630> really<00:03:02.780> cool<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:04.280> a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
it's it's actually really cool it's a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.220 
it's it's actually really cool it's a
glass<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> doors<00:03:05.000> look<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.300> lot<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.810> lot<00:03:06.080> of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
glass in the doors look a lot a lot of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.650 
glass in the doors look a lot a lot of
like<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.820> whenever<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.150> go<00:03:08.630> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
like and then I think whenever I go to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.600 
like and then I think whenever I go to
like<00:03:08.900> Mary<00:03:09.110> texture<00:03:09.380> ow<00:03:09.500> we're<00:03:10.100> texture<00:03:10.430> packs

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610

like Mary texture ow we're texture packs
like<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.209> think<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> grass<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.410> stuff

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
like this I think the grass and stuff

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.130 
like this I think the grass and stuff
always<00:03:12.890> looks<00:03:13.220> weird<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:14.840> like<00:03:14.959> really

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
always looks weird and it's like really

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.560 
always looks weird and it's like really
