00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
and in the performance so far

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.990 
and in the performance so far
we're<00:03:47.950> struggling<00:03:48.250> right<00:03:48.549> now<00:03:48.579> we<00:03:48.760> had<00:03:48.969> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
we're struggling right now we had a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720 
we're struggling right now we had a
great<00:03:49.269> start<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:49.780> season<00:03:50.340> 14<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.489> three

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
great start to the season 14 and three

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.130 
great start to the season 14 and three
and<00:03:51.879> then<00:03:52.060> since<00:03:52.299> then<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.810> know<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> think

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
and then since then you know I think

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.590 
and then since then you know I think
we've<00:03:53.230> been<00:03:53.349> under<00:03:53.469> 500<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.299> tough<00:03:55.299> for<00:03:55.329> us<00:03:55.569> but

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
we've been under 500 so tough for us but

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.700 
we've been under 500 so tough for us but
you<00:03:56.660> know<00:03:56.780> any<00:03:57.110> time<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.440> go<00:03:57.560> through

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
you know any time you go through

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.060 
you know any time you go through
difficult<00:03:57.920> times<00:03:58.310> an<00:03:59.240> opportunity<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.080> come

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
difficult times an opportunity to come

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.800 
difficult times an opportunity to come
back<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.580> be<00:04:01.670> better<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.240> hopefully<00:04:02.570> we'll

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
back and be better so hopefully we'll

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.180 
back and be better so hopefully we'll
figure<00:04:03.200> some<00:04:03.410> things<00:04:03.440> out<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:03.950> I'll<00:04:04.070> just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
figure some things out and I'll just

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.010 
figure some things out and I'll just
make<00:04:04.370> us<00:04:04.490> hungry<00:04:04.640> go<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.450> every<00:04:05.690> night<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.870> we

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
make us hungry go out every night and we

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.880 
make us hungry go out every night and we
want<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> fight<00:04:06.440> for

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
want to fight for

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.100 
want to fight for
birds<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.580> victories<00:04:08.970> but<00:04:09.210> we<00:04:09.690> take<00:04:09.900> things

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
birds and victories but we take things

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.570 
birds and victories but we take things
for<00:04:10.290> granted<00:04:10.319> every<00:04:10.800> cut<00:04:10.980> corners<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.490> I

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
for granted every cut corners and I

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.770 
for granted every cut corners and I
think<00:04:11.790> we're<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.060> good<00:04:12.209> enough<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.540> one<00:04:12.569> too

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
think we're not good enough for one too
