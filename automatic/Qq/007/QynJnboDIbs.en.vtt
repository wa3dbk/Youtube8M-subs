00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
I got mooned and I just thought that was

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.420 
I got mooned and I just thought that was
the<00:05:22.110> weirdest<00:05:22.500> thing<00:05:22.650> in<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.800> world<00:05:23.010> she<00:05:23.280> just

the weirdest thing in the world she just

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.850 
the weirdest thing in the world she just
tells<00:05:23.640> it<00:05:23.730> casually<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:25.110> know<00:05:25.230> because

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
tells it casually and you know because

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.560 
tells it casually and you know because
there<00:05:26.070> are<00:05:26.190> shooting<00:05:26.580> stars<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.210> know<00:05:27.270> I've

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
there are shooting stars and I know I've

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.320 
there are shooting stars and I know I've
heard<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.050> I've<00:05:28.170> never<00:05:28.320> seen<00:05:28.590> one<00:05:28.800> and

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
heard of that I've never seen one and

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.220 
heard of that I've never seen one and
there<00:05:30.330> are<00:05:30.450> people<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.810> get<00:05:30.990> hit<00:05:31.110> by

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
lightning but one of the chances of

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.780 
lightning but one of the chances of
actually<00:05:33.000> seeing<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:34.290> apparently<00:05:34.980> cuz<00:05:35.700> I

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
actually seeing and apparently cuz I

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
actually seeing and apparently cuz I
thought<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.180> there<00:05:36.270> was<00:05:36.360> something<00:05:36.540> people

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
thought that there was something people

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.510 
thought that there was something people

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
Lauren Graham seemed to see it mooned

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.750 
Lauren Graham seemed to see it mooned
all<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.090> time<00:05:42.300> she<00:05:42.540> said<00:05:42.570> just<00:05:43.730> people<00:05:44.730> just

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760

all the time she said just people just
moon<00:05:45.300> her<00:05:45.600> and<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.250> don't<00:05:47.250> I've<00:05:47.400> never<00:05:47.700> been

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
moon her and I don't I've never been

moon her and I don't I've never been
wound<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.450> then<00:05:48.570> she<00:05:48.780> starts<00:05:49.050> telling<00:05:49.320> me

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
wound and then she starts telling me

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.620 
wound and then she starts telling me
that<00:05:49.560> there<00:05:49.710> are<00:05:49.740> different<00:05:50.100> types<00:05:50.130> of

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
that there are different types of

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.940 
that there are different types of
mooning<00:05:51.630> like<00:05:51.990> there's<00:05:52.230> different<00:05:52.380> which<00:05:52.800> I

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
mooning like there's different which I

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.290 
mooning like there's different which I
didn't<00:05:53.220> know<00:05:53.250> either<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.760> perhaps<00:05:54.120> all

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
didn't know either and perhaps all

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.020 
didn't know either and perhaps all
enlighten<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:54.960> if<00:05:55.800> someone<00:05:56.310> moves<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.850> when

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
enlighten you if someone moves you when

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.740 
enlighten you if someone moves you when
the<00:05:57.150> windows<00:05:57.480> up<00:05:57.780> it's<00:05:58.230> called<00:05:58.530> pressed<00:05:58.920> ham

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.020 

and<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.740> thought<00:06:05.920> well<00:06:06.130> my<00:06:06.280> windows<00:06:06.700> are<00:06:06.850> tinted

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
and I thought well my windows are tinted

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.550 
and I thought well my windows are tinted
it'd<00:06:07.270> probably<00:06:07.420> be<00:06:07.660> trust<00:06:07.930> him<00:06:08.110> on<00:06:08.260> right<00:06:10.560> and

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
it'd probably be trust him on right and

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.100 
it'd probably be trust him on right and
if<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:11.920> window<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.370> down<00:06:12.550> make<00:06:13.390> sure<00:06:13.600> it's<00:06:13.840> a<00:06:13.930> but

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
if a window is down make sure it's a but

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.390 
if a window is down make sure it's a but
before<00:06:14.260> you<00:06:14.500> start<00:06:14.560> yelling<00:06:14.830> at<00:06:15.130> a<00:06:15.160> guy

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.640 

I've<00:06:19.910> never<00:06:20.210> been<00:06:20.449> wound<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:21.169> then<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.410> thought

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
I've never been wound and then I thought

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.530 
I've never been wound and then I thought
what<00:06:21.770> have<00:06:21.979> been<00:06:22.160> sort<00:06:22.490> of<00:06:22.669> I<00:06:22.820> mean<00:06:22.970> a<00:06:23.240> half

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
what have been sort of I mean a half

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.360 
what have been sort of I mean a half
moon<00:06:23.840> duh<00:06:24.080> because<00:06:24.410> when<00:06:24.650> someone<00:06:24.979> has<00:06:25.130> those

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
moon duh because when someone has those

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.879 
moon duh because when someone has those
low-rise<00:06:25.850> pants<00:06:26.240> and<00:06:26.570> they're<00:06:26.889> squatting

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
low-rise pants and they're squatting

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.890 
low-rise pants and they're squatting
over<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.610> then<00:06:28.729> so<00:06:29.030> that's<00:06:29.210> a<00:06:29.300> half<00:06:29.479> moon<00:06:29.720> I

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
over and then so that's a half moon I

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.430 
over and then so that's a half moon I
assume<00:06:30.229> and<00:06:30.470> if<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:31.490> farmer<00:06:31.910> is<00:06:32.090> is<00:06:32.660> on<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:32.990> you

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
assume and if a farmer is is on the you

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.409 
assume and if a farmer is is on the you
know<00:06:33.560> bending<00:06:34.340> down<00:06:34.490> to<00:06:34.729> get<00:06:34.880> a<00:06:34.910> crop<00:06:35.210> or

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
know bending down to get a crop or

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.340 
know bending down to get a crop or
something<00:06:35.810> I'd<00:06:35.930> be<00:06:36.080> a<00:06:36.110> Harvest<00:06:36.500> Moon<00:06:38.139> and<00:06:39.139> then

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
something I'd be a Harvest Moon and then

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.570 
something I'd be a Harvest Moon and then
I<00:06:39.440> thought<00:06:39.650> well<00:06:39.740> what<00:06:39.919> if<00:06:40.010> you<00:06:40.100> fall<00:06:40.250> in<00:06:40.310> love

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
I thought well what if you fall in love

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.980 
I thought well what if you fall in love
with<00:06:40.729> someone<00:06:40.940> who<00:06:41.270> moons<00:06:41.479> you<00:06:41.660> that<00:06:41.840> would<00:06:41.960> be

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
with someone who moons you that would be

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:52.159 
with someone who moons you that would be
a<00:06:42.050> total<00:06:42.380> eclipse<00:06:42.530> of<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.800> heart

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.899 

but<00:06:52.409> how<00:06:52.620> does<00:06:52.680> that<00:06:52.830> happen<00:06:53.159> people<00:06:53.639> have<00:06:53.669> it

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
but how does that happen people have it

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:59.450 
but how does that happen people have it
has<00:06:54.090> anybody<00:06:54.389> been<00:06:54.569> wound<00:06:54.870> here<00:06:55.229> have<00:06:55.439> you

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.920
