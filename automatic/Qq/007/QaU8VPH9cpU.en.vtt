and you know it's not something i want
to<00:05:05.600> see<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.750> know<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.110> want<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.380> see<00:05:06.470> her<00:05:06.530> team

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.900 
to see you know I want to see her team
coming<00:05:06.950> out<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.310> coming<00:05:07.490> out<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.700> gates

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
coming out and coming out of the gates

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.580 
coming out and coming out of the gates
but<00:05:08.090> they<00:05:08.240> scored<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:08.960> woke<00:05:09.140> us<00:05:09.260> up<00:05:09.380> and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
but they scored it and it woke us up and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.530 
but they scored it and it woke us up and
I<00:05:09.740> thought<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:10.070> took<00:05:10.729> over<00:05:10.850> large<00:05:11.180> parts<00:05:11.390> of

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
I thought we took over large parts of

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.670 
I thought we took over large parts of
that<00:05:11.630> period<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.960> thought<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.229> third<00:05:12.380> pair<00:05:12.560> is

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
that period I thought the third pair is

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.810 
that period I thought the third pair is
their<00:05:12.800> best<00:05:12.919> period<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.370> know<00:05:13.430> we<00:05:13.550> had<00:05:13.669> a<00:05:13.700> lot

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
their best period you know we had a lot

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.280 
their best period you know we had a lot
of<00:05:13.850> chances<00:05:14.270> calls<00:05:14.570> keep<00:05:14.750> what<00:05:14.900> made<00:05:15.050> some<00:05:15.200> big

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
of chances calls keep what made some big

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.320 
of chances calls keep what made some big
saves<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.770> know<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.070> need<00:05:16.280> some<00:05:16.850> chances<00:05:17.270> uh

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330
