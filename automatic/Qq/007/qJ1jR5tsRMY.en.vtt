you catch the flu or anything like that
your<00:04:20.169> lymph<00:04:20.440> nodes<00:04:20.709> are<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.949> first<00:04:21.220> thing

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
your lymph nodes are the first thing

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.089 
your lymph nodes are the first thing
that<00:04:21.430> gets<00:04:21.669> in<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:23.020> what<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.199> do<00:04:23.349> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.949> lay

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
that gets in so what you do if you lay

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.430 
that gets in so what you do if you lay
the<00:04:24.370> stomach<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.240> lay<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.229> small

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
the stomach on the lay the small

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.469 
the stomach on the lay the small
intestine<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.010> stomach<00:04:27.340> got<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.300> we

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
intestine on the stomach got like we

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.240 
intestine on the stomach got like we
call<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.870> Kathryn<00:04:29.289> worldwide<00:04:29.680> fireworks

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
call it the Kathryn worldwide fireworks

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.460 
call it the Kathryn worldwide fireworks
so<00:04:31.090> if<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.449> there's<00:04:31.750> two<00:04:31.900> ways<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.320> lay

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
so if you there's two ways you can lay

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.740 
so if you there's two ways you can lay
it<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:33.099> way<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.990> way<00:04:35.169> now<00:04:36.419> that's<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
it that way and that way now that's that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.200 
it that way and that way now that's that
way<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.349> wrong<00:04:38.530> way<00:04:38.849> because<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:40.000> can't

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
way is the wrong way because you can't

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.520 
way is the wrong way because you can't
see<00:04:40.389> anything<00:04:40.570> well<00:04:40.870> actually<00:04:40.990> they're<00:04:41.349> there

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
see anything well actually they're there

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.260 
see anything well actually they're there
but<00:04:42.039> you<00:04:42.190> can't<00:04:42.430> really<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.849> him<00:04:42.909> if<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.090> lay

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
but you can't really see him if you lay

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.560 
but you can't really see him if you lay
it<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.510> other<00:04:43.659> way

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
it the other way

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.420 
it the other way
they<00:04:45.170> actually<00:04:46.210> jump<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.360> at<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.690> okay

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
they actually jump out at you okay

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.610 
they actually jump out at you okay
and<00:04:50.360> what<00:04:50.510> you're<00:04:50.630> looking<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.200> anything
