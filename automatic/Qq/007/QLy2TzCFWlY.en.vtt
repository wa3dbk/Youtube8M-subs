00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.529
 jr 字 betting ticket 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.529
 Name method 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.679
 Hello everyone 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 It is off the beaten path raw method is Sakai today is yes joint 2 c to be held in Tokyo 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.660
 To think so please enjoy and want to expect here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660
 Hmm 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.040
 We would like to expect with it in Kyodo News Cup 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.800
 a Joint communication cup of last year gold ship and deep brillante are 12 and after that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.490
 It's because these two classics won 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 Well last year the other party was bad 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.610
 It Nde Hana is likely to aim this year along the trend I of this race but I feel say 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.410
 I think the Fu that I want take a quick attack 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.300
 8 and of the very strong and has the first day regular but points that I'm in this race 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.440
 It is mentioned as a feature 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:11.420
 It Is Ya Classic skirmish because careful to have this before performance 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.630
 Since the trial strategy almost used as a routine means the future by all means is not limited to this base also 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 I would like to keep in mind that it will be a race that looks forward to classics 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 Naturally, there is a tendency to forget about the previous achievements horses 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.540
 It's not a pre-war battle or trial 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 To wind Tteyuu horse, such as a mile proven here I do trivial Well Classic Dechotto 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.450
 And take a handful degree to one before 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.400
 Because there are many to bring, it is unexpected that there is speed like this before 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 There is a tendency that it is easy to happen that the child can be forced into force 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.700
 There is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.400
 this 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.550
 The race does not leak to the example 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.990
 The other is that horses with dart pedigree tend to be strong 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.100
 Well that I do as a mother father Misupuro-based Gold Allure production piece is worrisome if continuously 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.160
 There was also 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.840
 Horses that have likely pedigree able to run even I went so dirt 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.880
 It is one point to pay attention to this, and there is a track record mile and dart pedigree 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.880
 Well, I think that this is the target 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.870
 So I think this year but I want to make this Manbonunefu a favorite 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.099
 Mother and father storm cat Dirt pedigree horse has cleared 9 points and the results are quite new horse 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.920
 The win was a mile 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:22.080
 The Dart pedigree I mentioned earlier this year just that I had made a good run with a special made before 2 runs 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.430
 And it is preferable to aim at these two points of mileage achievement 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.750
 I'm thinking I just want to keep this simple. 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.980
 Likely around to become Well clearly the No. 1 popular But I is not say what happens to what extent popular 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.250
 Nja little I abduction interesting in that it's going to be on the other hand is a Well that sense Nde 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.290
 I think it seems like there is no joint communication cup this year 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.290
 Man also ぇ I want to make this a favorite 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.530
 Then, it is the 12 race final ace of Kyoto on Sunday because it is the attention ama horse pickup 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.280
 It is a top flyer I want to take up here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.670
 Recently in various places, it has been a bit under and it's actually secret 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.180
 There is also a place that is a bit overheard , but the Storm Cat boundary is very auscultated 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.470
 Ne 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:14.410
 I'm very bland it is as big feature is say this Storm Cat type 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.430
 The liquid crystal is fragile , and if you think that it has run, it will run suddenly and the screen will remain quite 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.550
 Even though you Irun 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.470
 If you put it back 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.420
 One other strange pedigree it is it when there is a possibility to come catch-up body blended but one-stroke suddenly 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.350
 Because it is a big feature 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.390
 It is surprising to say that it is a storm cat system dry ground that has lost the previous run in such a sense. 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.740
 I what to say and are often anxious 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.540
 I would like you to keep control as a pedigree principle but this top flyer 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.170
 It is a Storm Cat-based production frame may say a statue of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.890
 It is a birthplace of Liberty, but I lost a lot to 10 previous races, though 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.640
 I think that there is a feature of this line that the pong and recoil from such cases 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.349
 I will 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:54.030
 Although the previous race development was obviously severe, it has stopped around the old age 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.049
 Well, the popularity that I had in the front as a goal is not as bad as it is for western use and for what use 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.530
 I think 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.240
 Only the last arrival order person 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.020
 If you're going to be a child, it's a fight that can be rolled back, so this is where you want to win by all means 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.910
 See you 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:11.660
 It is only necessary to run away if it is a port . 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.660
 I want to expect to run away with this true two-stroke witch Fujita 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.840
 Yup 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.770
 Next week hey-this year's first central g 1 February stakes will be held now central 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.750
 dotty strong 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:34.970
 The place where such as Nihon Piro Awards Roman Legend Urban come does not go out 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.560
 I think the challenge to try it Well that match the pedigree basis in the fact that Karendura tee 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.860
 I basically not many more Toka thickness in particular 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.210
 But I'm not buying the basics right 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.870
 I think it is a place I want to pay attention to even if I leave the betting ticket what kind of run is shown 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.740
 I will 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.110
 I would like to disclose the forecast of the major February stakes including the area 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.760
