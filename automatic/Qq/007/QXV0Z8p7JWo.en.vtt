sky that's beaming these things down and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.749 
sky that's beaming these things down and
we<00:02:08.539> pick<00:02:08.750> them<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:09.379> somehow<00:02:10.369> I

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
we pick them up and that's somehow I

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.900 
we pick them up and that's somehow I
think<00:02:10.940> what<00:02:11.690> into<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.440> know<00:02:12.910> but

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
think what into a we just know but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.050 
think what into a we just know but
medical<00:02:14.420> intuition<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.349> should<00:02:15.769> be<00:02:16.400> accurate

medical intuition you should be accurate

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
medical intuition you should be accurate

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you say are practicing today well if you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.890 
you say are practicing today well if you
look<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> internet<00:02:23.500> millions<00:02:24.500> but

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
personally refer you to how does one

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.990 
personally refer you to how does one
train<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.569> be

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
train to be

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.690 
train to be
the<00:02:33.120> medical<00:02:33.480> intuitive<00:02:34.250> well<00:02:35.250> Carolyn<00:02:35.580> I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the medical intuitive well Carolyn I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.600 
the medical intuitive well Carolyn I
started<00:02:36.150> training<00:02:36.570> people<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.650> concept

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
started training people in this concept

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.460 
started training people in this concept
about<00:02:39.120> six<00:02:39.990> or<00:02:40.140> seven<00:02:40.440> years<00:02:40.680> ago<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:42.470> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
about six or seven years ago and you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.970 
about six or seven years ago and you
have<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.190> least<00:02:44.220> gross<00:02:44.760> anatomy<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
have to know at least gross anatomy and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.280 
have to know at least gross anatomy and
basic<00:02:46.980> physiology<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.600> teach<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.050> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
basic physiology so we teach that and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.720 
basic physiology so we teach that and
then<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.500> practice<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
then we practice and it's really a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.520 
then we practice and it's really a
question<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.420> practice<00:02:51.660> practice<00:02:52.440> practice

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
question of practice practice practice

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.050 
question of practice practice practice
and<00:02:54.260> we<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> check<00:02:56.040> sheet<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> diagnostic

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
and we have a check sheet a diagnostic

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.840 
and we have a check sheet a diagnostic
check<00:02:57.090> sheet<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.620> put<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.460> part<00:02:59.760> of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
check sheet and you can put what part of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.330 
check sheet and you can put what part of
the<00:02:59.910> body<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.510> affected<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.530> then<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.040> all

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the body is affected in then we have all

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.550 
the body is affected in then we have all
the<00:03:02.550> major<00:03:02.790> physiological<00:03:03.290> disorders<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the major physiological disorders and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.000 
the major physiological disorders and
that's<00:03:05.160> how<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.459> make<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> diagnosis<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.010> most

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
that's how you make a diagnosis and most

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.190 
that's how you make a diagnosis and most
people<00:03:08.310> will<00:03:08.430> practice<00:03:08.970> now<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.990> best

over<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.350> years<00:04:04.380> where<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.220> suspected<00:04:06.209> they

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
over the years where I suspected they

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.930 
over the years where I suspected they
had<00:04:06.600> cancer<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.799> could<00:04:08.010> not<00:04:08.190> diagnose<00:04:08.670> it

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
had cancer but we could not diagnose it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.620 
had cancer but we could not diagnose it
and<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.840> medical<00:04:10.200> intuitive<00:04:11.299> told<00:04:12.299> me<00:04:12.420> in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
and a medical intuitive told me in

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.009 
and a medical intuitive told me in
advance<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.320> cancer<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.280> we<00:04:14.660> worked<00:04:15.660> with

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
advance this is cancer so we worked with

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.900 
advance this is cancer so we worked with
the<00:04:16.560> patient<00:04:17.040> over<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.400> next<00:04:17.609> two<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.790> three

months until we could find the proper
diagnosis<00:04:21.140> I've<00:04:22.140> had<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:23.130> number<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.910> cases

and<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.200> be<00:04:40.229> tremendously<00:04:41.190> helpful<00:04:41.310> as

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
and so it can be tremendously helpful as

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.740 
and so it can be tremendously helpful as
an<00:04:42.000> adjunct

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
an adjunct

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.220 
an adjunct
but<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:44.240> general<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.450> think<00:04:45.479> medically

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
but in general I think medically

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.580 
but in general I think medically
-<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.620> must<00:04:47.130> work<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:48.200> cooperation<00:04:49.200> with<00:04:49.380> a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
- it is must work in cooperation with a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.670 
- it is must work in cooperation with a
licensed<00:04:50.190> person<00:04:50.910> so<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.990> diagnosis

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
licensed person so that the diagnosis

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.860 
licensed person so that the diagnosis
can<00:04:52.860> be<00:04:52.920> confirmed<00:04:53.040> when<00:04:53.730> they<00:04:53.880> make<00:04:54.090> one<00:04:54.330> in

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
can be confirmed when they make one in

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.810 
can be confirmed when they make one in
your<00:04:55.050> book<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.500> call<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.770> medical<00:04:56.190> intuition<00:04:56.700> a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
your book you call a medical intuition a

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.460 
your book you call a medical intuition a
science<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.510> soul<00:04:57.690> what<00:04:58.020> do<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.200> mean<00:04:58.320> by

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
science of the soul what do you mean by

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.960 
science of the soul what do you mean by
that<00:04:58.730> well<00:04:59.730> I<00:05:00.090> think<00:05:00.420> all<00:05:01.410> intuition<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.910> a

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that well I think all intuition is a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.260 
that well I think all intuition is a
science<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.840> soul<00:05:04.250> because<00:05:05.250> basically<00:05:05.580> it

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
science of the soul because basically it

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.050 
science of the soul because basically it
is<00:05:06.480> tuning<00:05:07.140> into<00:05:07.380> your<00:05:07.590> higher<00:05:08.160> self<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.910> get

is tuning into your higher self to get

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.930 
is tuning into your higher self to get
this<00:05:09.240> information<00:05:09.600> if<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:10.950> don't<00:05:11.280> get<00:05:11.580> rid<00:05:11.910> of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
this information if you don't get rid of

this information if you don't get rid of
your<00:05:12.240> own<00:05:12.420> personality

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
your own personality

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.920 
your own personality
it's<00:05:14.100> going<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.640> bleed<00:05:14.850> through<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.480> whatever

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
it's going to bleed through in whatever

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.890 
it's going to bleed through in whatever
you<00:05:16.140> see<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.400> best<00:05:17.790> medical<00:05:18.690> intuitive

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
you see and the best medical intuitive

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.570 
you see and the best medical intuitive
and<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.350> course<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> best<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.040> all<00:05:20.160> time<00:05:20.400> was

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
and of course the best of all time was

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.160 
and of course the best of all time was
Edgar<00:05:20.730> Cayce<00:05:21.120> no<00:05:21.810> question<00:05:22.230> about<00:05:22.290> it<00:05:23.150> but

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
Edgar Cayce no question about it but

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.110 
Edgar Cayce no question about it but
even<00:05:25.170> he<00:05:25.410> was<00:05:25.440> cautioned<00:05:26.220> not<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.430> do<00:05:26.760> as<00:05:26.910> many

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
even he was cautioned not to do as many

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.680 
even he was cautioned not to do as many
as<00:05:27.210> he<00:05:27.480> was<00:05:27.630> doing<00:05:27.990> because<00:05:28.830> if<00:05:29.190> they<00:05:29.690> overdo

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
as he was doing because if they overdo

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.180 
as he was doing because if they overdo
it<00:05:30.720> they're<00:05:31.350> not<00:05:31.470> going<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.710> be<00:05:31.830> as<00:05:31.920> accurate

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
it they're not going to be as accurate

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.660 
it they're not going to be as accurate
and<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:33.690> think<00:05:34.140> it's<00:05:34.320> extremely<00:05:34.980> important

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
and so I think it's extremely important

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.240 
and so I think it's extremely important
not<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.270> just<00:05:36.630> hang<00:05:37.020> out<00:05:37.230> and<00:05:37.410> try<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.680> read<00:05:37.920> 50

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
not to just hang out and try to read 50

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.370 
not to just hang out and try to read 50
people<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.760> day<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.300> way<00:05:39.420> some<00:05:39.630> physicians

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
people a day so the way some physicians

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.620 
people a day so the way some physicians
try<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.680> see<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:41.190> can't<00:05:41.880> imagine<00:05:42.240> seeing<00:05:42.390> 50

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
try to see I can't imagine seeing 50

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.200 
try to see I can't imagine seeing 50
patients<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.350> day<00:05:43.400> what<00:05:44.400> can<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.610> person<00:05:44.790> hope

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
patients in a day what can a person hope

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.570 
patients in a day what can a person hope

intuition really should be at home you

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.620 
intuition really should be at home you
should<00:05:51.060> start<00:05:51.660> by<00:05:52.050> knowing<00:05:52.460> yourself

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
should start by knowing yourself

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.810 
should start by knowing yourself
learning<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:55.350> get<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.770> feedback<00:05:56.160> from<00:05:56.640> your

that<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.700> doesn't<00:06:00.120> fester<00:06:00.660> and<00:06:00.840> become<00:06:01.110> a

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
that it doesn't fester and become a

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.680 
that it doesn't fester and become a
serious<00:06:01.620> illness<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:02.790> every<00:06:03.360> day<00:06:03.540> of<00:06:03.660> your
