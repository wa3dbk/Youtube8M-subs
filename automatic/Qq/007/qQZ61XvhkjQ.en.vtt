00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello, let's take a look at trackmania 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.849
 2 well i on 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.870
 That's what my colleague Victor has 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 looked at and logitech men 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.600
 trackmania katrin style with funky 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 stretch in the trackmania universe many 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.380
 will certainly be the first 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 sign for example kenya nations 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.310
 forever because I practically use it now 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.660
 third extension for trackmania 2 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 okay by extension that is, there was 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 others just before the first choice 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 Canyon was moderately desert 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 and the second was now stadium that was 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.000
 this stadium look from track nations 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.190
 forever and because it's practically like that now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.190
 green valleys alm meadows and so on 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.240
 what's more different than at stadium 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.580
 for example, here is also actually 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.870
 the small drawback of the game because there is 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.360
 not really many 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.750
 innovations up to the as said the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.610
 new environment the graphics would be that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.120
 yes polished up as you can see here 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.640
 can 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.220
 the night rides are already doing a lot 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.140
 in comparison to studies but im 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.970
 it is that one and all 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.020
 same game only with another 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.370
 surface can be said that way 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.869
 that is the basic package of gameplay 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.300
 the same as going to the stadiums 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.619
 If you bought one has certain stretch 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.670
 and modes and so on and that's in 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.950
 principle the same exactly from 65 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.650
 singleplayer stretch have a total 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.130
 extensive online mode replay title 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.010
 is again on board and a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 stretch editor where you stretch individual 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.740
 Build could share with the community 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.079
 can 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.759
 exactly the city billion and the beautiful one 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.140
 classic trackmania stretch dieter 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.090
 I played that 1 1 there it was 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.799
 already a big component and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.810
 was also a big part of the people wants 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.270
 I say and see as usual 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.340
 out 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.509
 right so you have as you here as well 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.490
 you can already see different ones 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.469
 possibilities it again with everything 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.489
 on board of loopings ski jumps 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.769
 start goal yes of course that can be 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.660
 The whole thing can also be played 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.670
 can also upload tracks from the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 the community rate is under load 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.530
 play and the whole then of course 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 also online 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.350
 and now the rallye is different 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.660
 only visually I tell others stretch 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.730
 the more beautiful landscape 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.990
 look or is there even more 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.800
 Kind of playful differences 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.990
 that's what I say 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 So you have as you just saw 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.430
 has the damage model of the vehicle is 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.300
 back on board that's a canyon 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.100
 already then was omitted in the stadium 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 and there's practically back in now 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.430
 Berlin 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.620
 so if your cracked crash 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.660
 for example , it could happen 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.600
 that the bonnet falls off or the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.280
 rear spoiler and yes such stories 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.110
 But also the physics of physics has that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 of course no impact because it is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.480
 yes no limits month but always 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 still playing you've just got the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.110
 physics approached differs 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.760
 how about the other two yes 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.570
 the controls are a bit different 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.920
 So nation has done so many times 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.540
 try this a bit more 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 to be more precise while I personally 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.840
 have to say that something has failed 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760
 because just the braking maneuvers in the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.980
 curves as soon as you open a bit 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.440
 the brake occurs immediately that 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.430
 the vehicle breaks and one um 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.810
 meet each other 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.180
 Of course you lose of course 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.180
 control and the best time is then 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.080
 course there 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.400
 that was a fright my only one 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.710
 principle similar there one had also the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.880
 There are three different types of trails 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.110
 three different cars and those have 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.280
 So easy to distinguish is also 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.900
 again the case in the sense 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.850
 within these three packages one man 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.850
 he can buy, so to speak, right 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.000
 trackmania valley is now the third 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 package that came last week on the fourth 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.190
 july for 1999 about steam or 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.800
 via the official platform 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.160
 buying mania planet what is the cost 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.650
 other packages i know from stadium that 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.180
 it costs nine euro 99 at canyon 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.130
 I do not really say that now 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.260
 to say exactly but I think that costs 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.910
 even around ten euros 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.709
 That's why I can not really 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
 understand why ubisoft now here 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.910
 again draufgepackt ten euros I did 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.710
 well you have a bit now 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.470
 better graphics and the beautiful environment 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.080
 but now I say the game principle 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.300
 and from the changes I find here is 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.630
 just not justified by old days 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 here 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.290
 it would be for fans this whole package 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.570
 otherwise, or for the sake of 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.210
 parade from stretch graphics correctly 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.740
 and all the others I advise to know 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.910
 or you continue to study 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.910
 everything also on board
