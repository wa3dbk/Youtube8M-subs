00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
but I would imagine that they do kind of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.040 
but I would imagine that they do kind of
need<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.180> have<00:01:35.210> them<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:35.570> some<00:01:35.750> sort<00:01:35.870> of<00:01:35.960> a

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
need to have them as some sort of a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.840 
need to have them as some sort of a
common<00:01:36.380> enemy<00:01:36.500> like<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.010> don't<00:01:37.250> they're<00:01:37.820> not

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
common enemy like they don't they're not

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.870 
common enemy like they don't they're not
fans<00:01:38.180> of<00:01:38.390> spider-man's<00:01:38.870> mr6<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:40.730> know

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
fans of spider-man's mr6 so you know

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.790 
fans of spider-man's mr6 so you know
what<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.030> mean<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.330> could<00:01:41.540> kind<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:41.840> that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
what I mean I could kind of see that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.230 
what I mean I could kind of see that
happening<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.340> don't<00:01:43.550> think<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.729> statistics

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
happening I don't think the statistics

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880 
happening I don't think the statistics
are<00:01:44.510> banding<00:01:44.960> together<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.290> fight<00:01:45.530> against

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
are banding together to fight against

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.580 
are banding together to fight against
neighborhood<00:01:46.190> hunger<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:46.940> yeah<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.659> think<00:01:47.900> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
neighborhood hunger so yeah I think I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.820 
neighborhood hunger so yeah I think I
think<00:01:50.080> sinister<00:01:51.080> sakes<00:01:51.320> will<00:01:51.409> probably<00:01:51.740> be

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
think sinister sakes will probably be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.410 
think sinister sakes will probably be
like<00:01:52.010> spider-man<00:01:52.340> will<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.850> peripheral

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
like spider-man will be the peripheral

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.480 
like spider-man will be the peripheral
as<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:53.960> like<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.920> flip<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.250> roles

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
as in like if you just flip the roles

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.940 
as in like if you just flip the roles
it'll<00:01:56.150> be<00:01:56.240> like<00:01:56.390> oh<00:01:56.570> he's<00:01:56.810> like<00:01:57.049> Doc<00:01:57.380> Ock<00:01:57.650> or

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it'll be like oh he's like Doc Ock or

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.710 
it'll be like oh he's like Doc Ock or
he's<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:58.460> electro<00:01:59.090> or<00:01:59.180> he's<00:01:59.360> like<00:01:59.540> the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
he's like electro or he's like the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.170 
he's like electro or he's like the
lizard<00:01:59.990> he'll<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.620> in<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.950> few<00:02:01.490> scenes<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
lizard he'll be in a few scenes and the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.789 
lizard he'll be in a few scenes and the
rest<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.570> will<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.750> formation<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.620> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
rest of it will be the formation of the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.130 
rest of it will be the formation of the
