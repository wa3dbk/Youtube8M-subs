hey guys we're looking at a couple of my

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.419 
hey guys we're looking at a couple of my
old<00:00:04.319> sea<00:00:04.710> fishing<00:00:05.190> weights<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:07.010> one's<00:00:08.010> three

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
old sea fishing weights here one's three

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.249 
old sea fishing weights here one's three
ounces<00:00:09.500> and<00:00:10.500> ones<00:00:10.769> four<00:00:11.190> ounces<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
ounces and ones four ounces and the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.860 
ounces and ones four ounces and the
reason<00:00:13.469> we're<00:00:13.799> looking<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.190> them<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
reason we're looking at them is in the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.279 
reason we're looking at them is in the
comments<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:16.920> cars<00:00:18.109> somebody<00:00:19.109> was

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
comments on one of my cars somebody was

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
comments on one of my cars somebody was
saying<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.100> make<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.460> gravity

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
saying they have to make a gravity

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.470 
saying they have to make a gravity
powered<00:00:21.480> car<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> weight<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> mass

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
powered car and the weight or the mass

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.400 
powered car and the weight or the mass
they're<00:00:24.779> allowed<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> use<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.800> 200<00:00:26.550> grams<00:00:27.410> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
they're allowed to use is 200 grams to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.640 
they're allowed to use is 200 grams to
drive<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> car<00:00:29.340> forwards<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:31.199> I've<00:00:31.500> had<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
drive the car forwards so I've had a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.340 
drive the car forwards so I've had a
quick<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.279> calculator<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.570> or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
quick look at my calculator here or

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.880 
quick look at my calculator here or
conversion<00:00:35.100> calculator<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> tells<00:00:37.710> me

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
conversion calculator and it tells me

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.510 
conversion calculator and it tells me
that<00:00:38.010> 200<00:00:38.700> grams<00:00:39.379> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> equivalent<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:42.140> 7.05

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
that 200 grams is the equivalent of 7.05

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.290 
that 200 grams is the equivalent of 7.05
479<00:00:44.520> 23<00:00:45.390> 9<00:00:45.629> ounces<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:48.230> 3<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> 4<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.890> 7<00:00:50.300> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
479 23 9 ounces so 3 and 4 is 7 that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
479 23 9 ounces so 3 and 4 is 7 that
should<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.719> close<00:00:51.960> enough<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> 200<00:00:53.010> grams<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
should be close enough to 200 grams to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
should be close enough to 200 grams to
make<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> these<00:00:54.600> cars<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> we'll<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.820> what

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
make one of these cars so we'll see what

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.529 
make one of these cars so we'll see what
we<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:58.550> right<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.760> make<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.210> gravity<00:01:01.050> car

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
we can do right to make this gravity car

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
we can do right to make this gravity car
I'm<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> modify<00:01:04.350> my<00:01:04.949> rubber<00:01:05.339> band

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
I'm just going to modify my rubber band

that'll make it nice and quick and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 
that'll make it nice and quick and
simple<00:01:12.530> just<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> test<00:01:13.920> whether<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> actually

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
simple just to test whether it actually

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.039 
simple just to test whether it actually
works<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.930> wheels<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.710> CD's<00:01:20.369> with

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.630 

there<00:03:13.400> we<00:03:13.490> go<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:14.360> my<00:03:15.640> gravity<00:03:16.640> powered

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
there we go that's my gravity powered

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.010 
there we go that's my gravity powered

lead weight quick summary what we've

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.370 
lead weight quick summary what we've
done<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.260> we've<00:03:36.440> erected<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:37.130> tripod<00:03:37.790> on<00:03:38.200> top<00:03:39.200> of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
done is we've erected a tripod on top of

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.730 
done is we've erected a tripod on top of
my<00:03:39.880> rubber<00:03:40.880> band<00:03:41.180> powered<00:03:41.630> car<00:03:42.140> number<00:03:42.560> eight

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
my rubber band powered car number eight

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.490 
my rubber band powered car number eight
which<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.610> one<00:03:43.730> nice<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.360> use<00:03:44.810> as<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:45.020> testbed

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
which is the one nice I use as a testbed

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.420 
which is the one nice I use as a testbed
for<00:03:45.709> all<00:03:46.100> of<00:03:46.280> my<00:03:46.840> modifications<00:03:47.840> or<00:03:48.709> most<00:03:49.310> of

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
for all of my modifications or most of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.920 
for all of my modifications or most of
my<00:03:49.550> modifications<00:03:53.260> as<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.350> pulley<00:03:55.540> that's<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.900> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
my modifications as a pulley that's on a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.340 
my modifications as a pulley that's on a
piece<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:57.950> bent<00:03:58.310> paper<00:03:58.730> clip<00:04:02.860> my<00:04:03.860> two<00:04:03.920> weights

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
piece of bent paper clip my two weights

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.940 
piece of bent paper clip my two weights
I've<00:04:06.350> put<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.740> bottom<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:08.620> pop<00:04:09.620> bottle

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
I've put the bottom of a pop bottle

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.620 
I've put the bottom of a pop bottle
there<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.670> catch<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.120> weight<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:11.600> they

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
there just to catch the weight so they

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.770 
there just to catch the weight so they
don't<00:04:11.900> fall<00:04:12.080> on<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.410> floor<00:04:13.720> potentially<00:04:14.720> you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
don't fall on the floor potentially you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.870 
don't fall on the floor potentially you
could<00:04:14.810> let<00:04:15.140> them<00:04:15.290> fall<00:04:15.530> on<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.860> floor<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.400> let

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
could let them fall on the floor and let

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.330 
could let them fall on the floor and let
the<00:04:17.000> car<00:04:17.180> run<00:04:17.209> over<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.140> might<00:04:18.340> find

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
the car run over and but you might find

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.490 
the car run over and but you might find
the<00:04:19.580> wheels<00:04:19.850> get<00:04:20.239> stuck<00:04:20.540> on<00:04:20.570> them<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.230> i

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the wheels get stuck on them so i

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.730 
the wheels get stuck on them so i
thought<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.859> was<00:04:21.919> neater<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.430> catch<00:04:22.640> them

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
thought it was neater to catch them

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.159 
thought it was neater to catch them
that's<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.919> very<00:04:25.070> simply<00:04:25.750> wraps<00:04:26.750> around<00:04:26.930> a

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
that's it very simply wraps around a

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.800 
that's it very simply wraps around a
pulley<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.680> back<00:04:27.919> there<00:04:28.220> pulley<00:04:28.820> around<00:04:29.690> a

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
pulley on the back there pulley around a

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.969 
pulley on the back there pulley around a
peg<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.560> back<00:04:30.710> there<00:04:32.560> wind<00:04:33.560> up<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.830> back

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
peg on the back there wind up the back

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.600 
peg on the back there wind up the back
axle<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.940> actually<00:04:35.120> wind<00:04:35.540> up<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.280> string<00:04:37.280> or

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
axle so actually wind up the string or

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.170 
axle so actually wind up the string or
so<00:04:37.910> I've<00:04:38.000> used<00:04:38.300> here<00:04:38.660> I've<00:04:38.900> used<00:04:39.970> fishing<00:04:40.970> line

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
so I've used here I've used fishing line

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.400 
so I've used here I've used fishing line
and<00:04:43.810> we've<00:04:44.810> got<00:04:44.990> five<00:04:45.229> meters<00:04:45.710> out<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.190> I

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
and we've got five meters out of it I

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.320 
and we've got five meters out of it I
think<00:04:48.410> I'll<00:04:48.530> do<00:04:48.680> another<00:04:48.800> one<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.160> these<00:04:52.330> made

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
think I'll do another one of these made

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.020 
think I'll do another one of these made
from<00:04:53.630> scratch<00:04:54.080> rather<00:04:54.800> than<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.550> modifying

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
from scratch rather than just modifying

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.900 
from scratch rather than just modifying
this<00:04:56.330> car<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.950> want<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.160> prove<00:04:58.430> whether<00:04:58.669> it

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
this car I just want to prove whether it

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.830 
this car I just want to prove whether it
worked<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.570> clearly<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.710> works<00:05:01.479> so<00:05:02.479> we'll<00:05:02.660> see

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
worked and clearly it works so we'll see

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.620 
worked and clearly it works so we'll see
if<00:05:02.870> we<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.110> do<00:05:03.200> another<00:05:03.380> one
