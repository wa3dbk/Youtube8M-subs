 Subsequently, good, because of the aldeas, the cholar production 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.919
 It is however 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.150
 almost instantly the man who decides to thunder 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:13.839
 well green light 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.559
 there is an audio 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.189
 how good is it circulating on the internet 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.460
 is more let's give the opportunity to be the people so that this one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 I heard yesterday we're going to comment on this agreement 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 he was in danger 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.900
 taylor marlon annual 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.880
 but the good the bad 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.250
 magnan 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 the team very good 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.460
 but also because 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.510
 the best time 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 but he did not succeed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 in a place in the workshop group 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.400
 side on the moon but that after day 5 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
 in rural surroundings golborne 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.900
 to achieve an opinion 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 jonathan demme 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.740
 good morning and is aware that the audio 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.960
 p if we listen carefully the last p that speaks and you are you are not 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.120
 Juan Tenorio the hollies a little unhappy with one not 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.640
 they do not agree with that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.890
 with that devotion as 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 of course I do not agree this was an arbitrary description and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.980
 unilateral 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.740
 more than anything never said this is the problem is the only way 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.710
 to be able how easy they think we are as we will see how we correct 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 there was never an opportunity for anything simply 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.710
 they said 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.760
 Rubalcacaba and it's over and they said it's a lot 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.600
 said raul 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.549
 then I did not agree could disappear overnight 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.280
 group in which to invest your illusions your work 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.779
 your effort your discipline 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.169
 no time to live several years of his life 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.979
 it is because someone says this ended portillo form the group and goodbye 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.819
 until tomorrow that goes well for you as it can not be something 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.059
 that one can give a lot to talk about 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 but I did not have another because 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.049
 everyone accepted it 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.839
 because there was an improvement agreement that is something that we have been few know 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.619
 but so that I could affect 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.459
 when leaving mcallen and leave in peace to luzbel 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.680
 the agreement agreements because nobody absolutely nobody neither he nor I neither 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.759
 no one 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.469
 they did not respect a torrent 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.869
 that Arturo did not respect, of course, that they were not 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:58.419
 yes but the promoter program 'live miranda' varela discussion was told 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.830
 with him good me nor the cougars 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.610
 in addition arturo illia out of course by his own decision was also 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.890
 he did not have his concept of the difficult field there were four magical groups was not for 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.970
 nothing a trojan 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.889
 and the man 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.279
 i only know that deal go with support has respected so far truth 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.109
 same respect as a word 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.789
 you have the keyword 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:25.829
 of course, of course 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.339
 that audio you p 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.309
 they recorded him who was in the French pantheon 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:35.019
 in the program d there rock pop how was that part 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.609
 If it was a savings program we had several locations in 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.009
 the issue of the products out there by peralvillo on an abandoned bus 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.159
 for on the street 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.329
 the point seemed like a good idea 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.019
 do the farewell 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.049
 in an old car like that until here came to 1 this was the idea of ​​a car 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:55.949
 old 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.389
 and you the locations in the French courtyard that by the way circulate in 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.599
 but it is not a precept of the death of the estuary will also lend for what 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.779
 aims to preserve the complete 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.639
 six were the shots that 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.299
 Quique that could not be crystallized in a single program to conclude 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.069
 but they were taken advantage of to complete other programs 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.739
 and that was the key no víctor ide 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.689
 from the eye eagle's nest 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.370
 if it happened later 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.840
 everyone disintegrates 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.920
 the way to your house you said balloon and each one 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.759
 expensive canteen and to take a beer of courage or what you wanted 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.610
 a look 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.410
 I still remember as if it was yesterday not in the French pantheon what happened 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.990
 it was not the affirmation of felipe ortiz well the french pantheon was the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.379
 burial of his level of course I hope to see him 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.389
 since ending in the location 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.740
 in the French patio 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.349
 of a strong discussion among all of us mainly before rowing there was 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.999
 I heard 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.520
 practically 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 there they went to raul said up here came a cd 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.759
 i what this one 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.219
 ellis cultivated i little the rich roll where 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.009
 the pact what I just commented to you 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.460
 the one of not using the name of Miguel 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.740
 and everything so that just as he died in the French pantheon he referred to tournaments 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.479
 atp 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.210
 and there he was buried but you someone revived him one day 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.960
 circulating through the streets of my city and a large poster that said the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.330
 man's return will go 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.340
 and I said obiols live I have not failed I already have a group that 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.509
 guatemala can not give 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.349
 I'm not aware of this return 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.649
 villa later it was he who informed me that these proposals should 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.649
 brand new singer 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.189
 look at my opinion 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.330
 blood alley 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.180
 my opinion is up to now 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.180
 that there are no longer few 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.719
 there is no longer a group of 1 plus it brings with quotes out there that are counted 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.559
 behind behind the stage with the current one level that to the small groups 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.240
 of tickets the musicians 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.199
 because he is not given what is promised 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.879
 and for that reason today to the Colombian but good that cry I will have to ask him 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:23.000
 arturo ui week in some interview and stop and it's little for the mind in 2000 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.839
 popular that do not have clear 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:31.039
 Yes, of course, but the former player of the north allows others to proceed and a shackle 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.219
 of 911 to start clear 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.340
 and what is good then 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.020
 if indeed the blowout has a disc but that was the grave where it comes 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.710
 any disc 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.689
 the former pivot 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.800
 the abdomen and another police 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.979
 unofficial is already apocryphal idea is an invented story 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.339
 I remember that on some occasion with walls 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.080
 in the tracks 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.460
 name very bad news very badly recorded I fell but well I tell you they are 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.469
 of the things you will have to talk with arturo ui sharma 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.520
 because allow 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.129
 Bad recordings made 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:09.529
 with the name of a band 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:13.279
 because he has written history and of course how much you are part of his 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.319
 history and what the people informed the people who read 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.610
 the people who try sarver
