00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.709
 juncker 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.679
 in the same way 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.490
 we turn ten years old and with that yes it is years increases the commitment that we have 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.529
 what to do 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.539
 so 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.999
 that it seemed Shi'a we see something really of the latest technology 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.349
 let's travel together in a toyota prius a vehicle whistles 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.950
 recently presented in Argentina something of that but furor in the world 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.790
 and believe me, what comes 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.780
 we are going 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 start up 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.760
 you can go 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.409
 and please listen to the roar 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.409
 electric motor 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.439
 very weird in all my years of devotion to one of that year's leader 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.480
 it seems really incredible 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.030
 proven to be tired about what alternative fuels are 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.510
 the car stops shown we have talked about hybrid cars 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.410
 but noted by 2007 at which time we are driving something that is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.440
 directly related to this case is a toyota prius 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.970
 that your opportunity a couple of years ago in japan for orchestra the argentina 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.160
 market 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.830
 i will comply or not stop I do it causes that another matter was voicing 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.670
 magnificent and apart from manifest electric commission I do not know whose fruits 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 At first sight it looks like a brook togas cat can pass and even when the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310
 engine works the engine of víctor manuel reyna muleña 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.270
 also extremely silent 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 economically very good has everything you can ask author to have 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.869
 you will feel comfortable 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.669
 if you add to that 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.749
 the issue of what served 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.339
 and I can tell you until now 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.339
 on Thursday in the fourth city acceleration test of drainage 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.559
 concord 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:24.180
 the goal adam a consumption of this drug in the 27 + 5 kilometers 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 per liter that is one thing versus the terrain of what I was doing was science 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.599
 fiction 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.319
 for a gasoline engine 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.489
 18 comas 5 kilometers per liter chile would be talking about a vehicle that the 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.629
 impasse of docks in the second furnace that is not maximum 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.189
 31 400 kilometers per hour 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:50.459
 has everything you can ask for a car 18 with more than five kilometers per liter very 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.989
 few gasoleros 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.480
 very few can say that you have consumption and if you can not take it back 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.880
 a very special connection 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.610
 the president of the ladies protocols and stabilized a certain speed here 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.990
 we are talking about an average an average consumption 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.939
 of city that is where they are normally consumed most 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.479
 and route 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.229
 urban percent 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.779
 suburban p 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:19.349
 really an average of consumption 18 point five kilometers per liter of everything 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.979
 that has been giving me so far 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.169
 this the third generation 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.199
 these vehicles in the previous period 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.360
 He recalled that the United States 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.399
 sold as lollipops 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.399
 the time to put there are only one and a half million vehicles 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.579
 if they have demand what can not meet the external demand 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.969
 despite being a success 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.209
 really gives all lights 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.029
 cole replication of this 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.299
 or how can it be that a vehicle consumatum a vehicle analyst 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.609
 wins with a hybrid engine on one side internal combustion engine and the 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.919
 Electric motor combined to drive the vehicle 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.559
 what you lost to make those investments or stop 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.729
 that the conventional vehicle casino lost it 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.669
 I understand what it is if I prevent it recovers never again here if it recovers 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.689
 you have to recover the accumulated and then lusa 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.650
 this engine turns on the internal combustion engine turns on and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.950
 exclusively 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.080
 when it is necessary if you do not feel it therefore you do not consume 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.629
 I show you how the whole sequence is first juventus 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.919
 bonomo the driver euros to stay and bright there until they were given 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.610
 life that are extremely interesting 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.719
 we do not start 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.829
 with the automatic box I put what generates the first special powel bring 

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.809
 I put it in motion and it was commented in braille 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:53.120
 and I'm just going to release the brake pedal 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.570
 chemicals start again and if you observe the flow that is showing in 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.080
 the battery diagram 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.690
 goes to the electric motor and the electric motor goes to the rust they start to spin 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.039
 and the naphtha engine while discussing how it is composed up to now 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.729
 he took it for granted 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.719
 I remind you that all this is saving fuel I went to brake look what 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.719
 it happens immediately the flow was reversed 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.380
 up there because the brake starts charging the battery again be the same 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.069
 according to the first mayor 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.520
 again I am feeding you decide your engine and so far my dear friend 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
 after being a miserable drop of fuel 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.850
 begins to understand how in the advantage between the incredible field advantage that 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.309
 until this electrical mode protects I know what happens when he asserted 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:49.849
 when he asserted right now the thing changed the engine is driving 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.210
 to the wheels 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.349
 directly is sending energy have also generated 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210
 is taking also required battery 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.129
 if so, penance, a gender module was required 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.580
 but it accelerated more than what happens 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.629
 right there the two are working bogota ap rolando pointed 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.150
 Well, they are criminal 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.139
 and the other one is the one that has to recover energy which effectively if 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:18.710
 this 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.339
 From the beginning 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.449
 of example he took spoke of this he delivered the eu as the laundry what 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:25.879
 good to go back 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:30.539
 that combination of who regained Bogota Sep 21 in the Senate 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.310
 psp of the motor tín charges electricity that sector assured 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:39.349
 that the ones that really left us the hybrid vehicle produced a 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.249
 energy recovery that allows you to develop in this case 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.210
 practices of the banana sector and experimenting 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.619
 18 as possible 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:50.020
 kilometers per liter 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.100
 and this is not the fantasy country that's what come January 10 this is 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:55.159
 what is going to come 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.860
 this is an example to follow 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.119
 I really wanted to share with you because 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.810
 it's an experience 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.189
 here in Argentina and India is the first hybrid vehicle 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.439
 arrives in the country 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.209
 but what is surprising when you experience it, you really think that 

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:13.069
 This works 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.400
 it works without errors 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.410
 and you think about the technology that lac is involved in the complexity of 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.789
 development that implies for it to work 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.789
 it has occurred in series they gave the touch 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:26.699
 precisely to not believe it
