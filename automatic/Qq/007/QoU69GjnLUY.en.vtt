00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
for their water-based gloves reasons why

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.590 
for their water-based gloves reasons why
our<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.109> soft<00:00:19.529> latex<00:00:20.130> when<00:00:21.029> dampened

the<00:01:08.010> gloves<00:01:08.280> before<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.450> start<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the gloves before we start using this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.060 
the gloves before we start using this
type<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> latex

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
type of latex

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.410 
type of latex
you<00:01:11.189> should<00:01:11.369> always<00:01:11.580> dampen<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you should always dampen it with a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
you should always dampen it with a
little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> water<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.220> means<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
little bit of water this just means a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
little bit of water this just means a
latex<00:01:15.030> does<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.240> rough<00:01:15.600> away<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.840> quickly<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
latex does not rough away as quickly and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
latex does not rough away as quickly and
then<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.950> improve<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> lifespan<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> your

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
then can improve the lifespan of your

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.370 
then can improve the lifespan of your
gloves<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> only<00:01:21.000> big<00:01:21.210> disavow<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
gloves the only big disavow with this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
gloves the only big disavow with this
glove<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> latex<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.570> soft

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
glove is that because the latex is soft

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
glove is that because the latex is soft
the<00:01:25.320> durability<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:26.250> degrade<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.850> lot

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the durability will degrade a lot

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
the durability will degrade a lot
quicker<00:01:27.390> than<00:01:27.600> any<00:01:27.869> other<00:01:28.049> type<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> latex<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
quicker than any other type of latex you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
quicker than any other type of latex you
should<00:01:29.850> always<00:01:30.030> keep<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> bottle<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.869> water

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
should always keep a bottle of water

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.920 
should always keep a bottle of water
nearby<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.250> add<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.640> latex<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.420> it
