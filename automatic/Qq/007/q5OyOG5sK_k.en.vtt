00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.889
 it was about five or six 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.990
 years ago when I last pokémon 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.220
 I had wanted to play again 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.230
 play yellow edition 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.759
 but I had the exact reason for that 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.060
 I did not feel like it 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.340
 to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.689
 I saw that still an old score 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.880
 was available and I wanted to see where 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.919
 I had stopped then 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.610
 actually a very ordinary team in 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:36.309
 blumberg and pikachu kiki on water in 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.860
 ohligs and catchy strangely 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 There is something wrong with the gait 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.269
 Nickname was just a friend 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.039
 besides, then grinned against how not 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.609
 otherwise he was his facial expression 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.890
 angry 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.269
 that was a bit scary but me 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.069
 thought that might just be a bug 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.630
 or I just have the sport once 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.550
 had his memory 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.170
 after a few seconds the game stopped 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.920
 under screen began to rush 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.590
 suddenly there was a text on the picture you 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 left me alone 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.489
 You said I'm a friend and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 After all these years you think it is 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 everything okay 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 after that the gameboy crashed and the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.659
 screen got black ran 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 chills on the back 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.319
 I have never seen such a bug 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.740
 I mean that could only one bank 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.039
 his 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 I mean it's a game of the game boy 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.250
 did not want to start anymore 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.100
 but no matter because it was time anyway 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.810
 to quit because I had to go to school 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.429
 but somehow everything was done to me 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 all in a funny purple 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.590
 Hue as I opened the room door 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.569
 grabbed me scare the entire 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.209
 environment was devastated as if the house was 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.890
 ancient stairs are down and 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.659
 my mother asked what happened 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.209
 but she did not know how 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649
 i had a problem or something 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.640
 was going on 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.330
 maybe I was just too 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.800
 tired and made what to me 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 I finally got on my way 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.450
 to school more specifically on the way 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.189
 to the bus stop 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.899
 everything was normal again 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.880
 only I had the feeling as if me and 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.469
 the one pursued in school 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.840
 Arrived I sat on my bench and 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.579
 is understood in the teacher to me but 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.229
 not a single word and when he stopped 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.690
 Everyone has to talk to me 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.310
 I almost had a heart attack because 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.099
 all my classmates bloodshot 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.569
 eyes had some spitting blood and me 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.200
 again saw everything in this purple 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.019
 hue 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.849
 I ran out of the schulz always has 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.540
 out of school was free 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.910
 it is no different 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.470
 all the people around me are watching me 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.900
 with the same look and the whole 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.830
 world was bathed in violet i knew 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.180
 not something was going on 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.430
 I ran as fast as I could 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.630
 home even my mother is just like that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.700
 bad like everyone else 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.140
 But I wanted to know what's going on and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.650
 I told her everything had happened 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.420
 was 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.980
 then she grabbed me and we drove to 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 gave a doctor's appointment any pills 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.549
 short time after taking the pills 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.230
 everything was normal again 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.269
 I thought I really had one 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.380
 problem so it has nothing to do with the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.480
 pokémon game to do 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.950
 but when I went to sleep in the evening 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.970
 I heard the whole time was the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.880
 screaming out of the game 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.889
 over and over again I always got 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.630
 more scared and I started to scream 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.269
 After that everything went black and me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.160
 I lost consciousness when I woke up 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.910
 was in some cell and I had 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.489
 a jacket on 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.319
 When I asked what was going on, they told me 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.900
 that I had killed my mother and 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.459
 would have laughed again stands the doctors 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.760
 left the room and suddenly stood 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.230
 something written on the wall with blood 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.440
 Now you finally feel like me 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.440
 feel whole time 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.440
 lonely
