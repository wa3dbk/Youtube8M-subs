focus on your analysis so look at the
sample<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.629> think<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.620> story<00:00:46.890> teaches

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
sample I think this story teaches

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
sample I think this story teaches
readers<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> narrator<00:00:48.450> cannot<00:00:48.780> always<00:00:49.050> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
readers that a narrator cannot always be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.520 
readers that a narrator cannot always be
trusted<00:00:49.879> that's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> sample<00:00:51.180> sentence<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
trusted that's the sample sentence you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
trusted that's the sample sentence you
should<00:00:52.710> drop<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.570> sentence

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
should drop the I think so your sentence

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.560 
should drop the I think so your sentence
just<00:00:55.260> says<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.920> story<00:00:56.399> teaches<00:00:56.820> readers

that the narrator cannot always be

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
that the narrator cannot always be
trusted<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> take<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.500> take

sentences<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.430> fanboys<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.570> academic

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sentences with fanboys in academic

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
sentences with fanboys in academic
writing<00:01:20.689> rule<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:24.299> should<00:01:24.330> avoid

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
writing rule three you should avoid

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.830 
writing rule three you should avoid
using<00:01:25.470> contractions<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:26.909> least<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.479> fewer

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
using contractions or at least use fewer

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.859 
using contractions or at least use fewer
contractions<00:01:28.619> than<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> might<00:01:29.100> normally<00:01:29.130> use

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
contractions than you might normally use

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
contractions than you might normally use
so<00:01:31.070> contractions<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.310> words<00:01:32.670> made<00:01:33.119> from<00:01:33.420> two

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so contractions are words made from two

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
so contractions are words made from two
other<00:01:33.750> words<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.170> contraction<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> word<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
other words a contraction is a word that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.359 
other words a contraction is a word that
is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> shortened<00:01:36.030> form<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:37.049> words<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.130> here

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
is a shortened form of two words so here

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.120 
is a shortened form of two words so here
comes<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.729> examples<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
comes some examples the first one is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.480 
comes some examples the first one is
couldn't<00:01:41.640> instead<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.460> try<00:01:44.460> to

avoid using couldn't instead use could

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.030 
avoid using couldn't instead use could
not<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.850> should've<00:01:48.390> instead<00:01:49.140> use

not also don't use should've instead use
should<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.259> said<00:01:52.320> there's<00:01:52.649> some

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
should have now like I said there's some

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.859 
should have now like I said there's some
exceptions<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:54.000> contractions<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.720> used

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
exceptions so some contractions are used

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.630 
exceptions so some contractions are used
more<00:01:55.140> often<00:01:55.320> than<00:01:55.590> others<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.009> can't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
more often than others like can't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.480 
more often than others like can't
instead<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> cannot<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
instead of cannot you just you have to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
instead of cannot you just you have to
use<00:01:59.729> your<00:01:59.939> own<00:02:00.060> judgment<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> mostly

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
use your own judgment here and mostly
