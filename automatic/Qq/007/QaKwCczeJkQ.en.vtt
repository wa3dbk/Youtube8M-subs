00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.730
 hello very good to all that such as 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.740
 we are and well then in this video os 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.110
 I will teach how to deactivate the control 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.759
 of user accounts or said of another 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.640
 way how to deactivate these wise people that 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.890
 do not come out if we want to allow it to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
 open a program run an application 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.509
 etc 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 I'll give you an example if we do 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.410
 this here run single this is the one that 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.879
 I say this this kind of notices that we 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.309
 they always come out that we want to execute as 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.550
 administrator or we have to access the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.949
 team we leave this this notice of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 user account and well then in this 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.129
 video I will show you how to remove this notice 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 so they do not warn us anymore and we're already 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.500
 tired so let's go to it we're going to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.290
 start control panel and let's go to the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.949
 control of a user account 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.240
 or user account and we will change in 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 configuration of user accounts 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 also called as uac 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.780
 and here you do not get a bar that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.990
 The more we go up, the more we will go 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.390
 warn and we will put it here to the minimum 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.049
 and this is the only warning we are going to 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.729
 have the last one selected if in the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.960
 if you have us administrators then 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 they are going to ask for an account 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.020
 administrator or a password and once 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 done this already will have finished 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 check it right button functions 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 as an administrator because there we have already been 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.340
 open without asking for any permission 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.520
