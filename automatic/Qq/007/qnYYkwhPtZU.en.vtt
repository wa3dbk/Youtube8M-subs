00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.660 
to go to put it together I put all of my
pieces<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.550> lap<00:00:30.650> with<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.480> seam<00:00:34.550> going<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
pieces on my lap with the seam going the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
pieces on my lap with the seam going the
same<00:00:35.880> direction<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.719> I've<00:00:36.930> got<00:00:36.960> fuzzies<00:00:37.500> on

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
same direction so if I've got fuzzies on

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
same direction so if I've got fuzzies on
this<00:00:37.770> side<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> fuzzies<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.090> them

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this side the fuzzies are on all of them

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.260 
this side the fuzzies are on all of them
so<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:41.129> grain<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so that all of my grain is going the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
so that all of my grain is going the
same<00:00:42.510> way<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.100> pieces<00:00:44.430> up

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.520 
my welt if it was going into a washable
slipcover<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.070> cut<00:02:57.370> my<00:02:57.810> welt<00:02:58.810> cover<00:02:59.260> at

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
slipcover because I cut my welt cover at

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.190 
slipcover because I cut my welt cover at
one<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.920> three<00:03:00.160> quarters<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.690> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
one and three quarters this is a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.730 
one and three quarters this is a
quarter-inch<00:03:02.560> welt<00:03:03.690> when<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> fold<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.290> over<00:03:05.440> I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
quarter-inch welt when I fold it over I

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:22.960 
quarter-inch welt when I fold it over I
get<00:03:06.340> exactly<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.300> half<00:03:07.600> inch<00:03:07.840> seam<00:03:08.110> allowance

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.449 

so<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.269> use<00:03:24.690> my<00:03:25.549> zipper<00:03:26.549> foot<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:28.860> make<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.220> welt

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
so I use my zipper foot to make my welt

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.559 
so I use my zipper foot to make my welt
with<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:31.159> know<00:03:32.159> many<00:03:32.640> people<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.269> actually

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
with I know many people can actually

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.089 
with I know many people can actually
make<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.959> welt<00:03:34.170> as<00:03:34.409> they<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.830> on<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
make the welt as they put it on the

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.729 
make the welt as they put it on the
pillow<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:36.659> simply<00:03:37.110> don't<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.379> enough

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
pillow and I simply don't have enough

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.470 
pillow and I simply don't have enough
control<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:38.910> always<00:03:39.180> make<00:03:39.299> my

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
control to do that so I always make my

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.830 
control to do that so I always make my
well<00:03:39.780> for<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:43.760> finger<00:03:44.760> press<00:03:45.030> open<00:03:45.480> all<00:03:45.629> my

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
well for I finger press open all my

00:03:45.840 --> 00:04:05.240 
well for I finger press open all my
scenes<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.599> found<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.109> an<00:04:04.560> old<00:04:04.829> milk

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
scenes and I found that in an old milk

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.839 
scenes and I found that in an old milk
crate<00:04:05.579> with<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.390> stick<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.140> works<00:04:08.040> great<00:04:08.400> for

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
crate with a stick in it works great for

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:16.219 
crate with a stick in it works great for
a<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:09.510> big<00:04:10.470> roller<00:04:10.739> welt<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.959> move<00:04:16.139> it

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
a a big roller welt you can move it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:35.610 
a a big roller welt you can move it
anyplace

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:51.629 

I<00:04:49.800> can't<00:04:50.800> think<00:04:51.040> that's<00:04:51.190> enough<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:51.460> the

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
I can't think that's enough for the

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.150 
I can't think that's enough for the
project
