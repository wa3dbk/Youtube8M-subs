00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.180
 but it gets three and falls 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.939
 with the unboxing of the yes tell me 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.840
 ordered things from the plan studied 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.940
 slot as well as persistently ordered with it 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.579
 We could have to share the shipment 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:44.300
 also shared the thriller and yes I had 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.620
 Although asked soon two months ago 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.350
 but I need a few more now 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.199
 things for new boxes now on 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.559
 be witness and yes what do you see then 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.809
 I'll say so with my times 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 ask and the things I do 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.559
 put on together around the 25th 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 But euro so the dollar has twelve in 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.720
 remembered is new stripe but euro around 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.680
 the person stood the 25 persons piece of paper 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
 to be there too 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.490
 sorry for sent so late going 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.740
 So here's everything in there money is already 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:38.660
 we thank hear us hear again we 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.970
 us on skype then now to the things 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.350
 I ordered and that is the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.260
 once a delta squad command post 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.910
 I think is very cool I did not have 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.580
 Let's see who are now so she has 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:58.550
 not as a cash register by itself then one 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.470
 decay like a sports camp and you can do it 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.710
 guess how kind the oldest one 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.000
 fixed also still holds a completely 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.050
 white reality also such a command 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.379
 helm what the result is yes 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.099
 that I'll say it will be another 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.269
 I do not say anything more now 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.250
 maybe some already know me 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.010
 already said that make 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.110
 then I got in friend 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.140
 So friebis not only here 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.330
 I get it so I have a son 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 red as they got here I had 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 actually a macro bino cola sight 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.910
 put in red that is a bit stupid now 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.480
 because I do not do that much with it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.840
 can 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.370
 but well, it can happen 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 I think so too 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.220
 happened that the HMi have confused 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.580
 have the times but in time 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.430
 Not noticed does not appear that way 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.600
 bad does not depend on i can 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
 has me as she is already 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.040
 funds made from the brown visor 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.420
 That's why I only wanted to go through one 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.810
 But replacing the right one is not like that 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.010
 bad then that's really a sand 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.080
 green phase 1 should be like in now 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 Detectives one 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.690
 yes this is monument phase a phase 1 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 brown on sight and once this 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.290
 brown hair that already three or 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.700
 four times but that's not bad 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.560
 can you for clown and so on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.880
 use 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.260
 So as I said that with the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720
 confusion of the visor is not 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.890
 bad 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.200
 the other is all right 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.880
 I think it's cool that's why I ordered 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.700
 this one thank you and thick but 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.430
 recommendation of a clown to news yes he 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.660
 has for his box though he is now too 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.069
