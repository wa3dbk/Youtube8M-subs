00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
know when I do have a bad diet I'm

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.359 
know when I do have a bad diet I'm
pretty<00:01:54.639> much<00:01:54.849> just<00:01:54.909> depressed<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.369> think

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
pretty much just depressed so I think

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.190 
pretty much just depressed so I think
it's<00:01:57.520> chemical<00:01:58.029> to<00:01:58.149> be<00:01:58.270> honest<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:58.840> what<00:01:59.079> we

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
it's chemical to be honest with what we

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.109 
it's chemical to be honest with what we
eat<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.679> I'm<00:02:00.039> gonna<00:02:00.189> keep<00:02:00.429> off<00:02:00.579> it's<00:02:00.759> just<00:02:00.849> not

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
eat so I'm gonna keep off it's just not

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.419 
eat so I'm gonna keep off it's just not
worth<00:02:01.299> it<00:02:01.450> or<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.899> sports<00:02:02.349> lauter<00:02:02.709> spot<00:02:03.039> well
