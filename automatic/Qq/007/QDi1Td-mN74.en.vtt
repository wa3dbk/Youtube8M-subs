00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860 

it's<00:00:00.120> manageable<00:00:01.790> and<00:00:02.790> as<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.570> see<00:00:03.600> there

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
it's manageable and as you can see there

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.539 
it's manageable and as you can see there
the<00:00:03.990> unicorns<00:00:04.529> they're<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:04.980> there<00:00:05.400> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
the unicorns they're really there the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.760 
the unicorns they're really there the
hardest<00:00:05.970> part<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.109> level<00:00:07.500> because

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hardest part of this level because

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.700 
hardest part of this level because
they're<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.840> fast<00:00:09.840> compared<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.440> yellow

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
they're so fast compared to yellow

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.980 
they're so fast compared to yellow
monsters<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.550> they<00:00:12.030> also<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.809> highest

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
monsters and they also have the highest

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.150 
monsters and they also have the highest
HP<00:00:14.240> whereas<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.690> flowers<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.289> really

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
HP whereas the flowers just really

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
HP whereas the flowers just really
really<00:00:17.340> weak<00:00:17.640> um<00:00:20.420> compared<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.830> both<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
really weak um compared to both the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
really weak um compared to both the
teddy<00:00:23.609> bear<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.480> unicorn<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:27.230> as<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
teddy bear and the unicorn but as you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
teddy bear and the unicorn but as you
can<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.730> pretty<00:00:30.269> simple<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
can see right here it's pretty simple I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.220 
can see right here it's pretty simple I
think<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> without<00:00:32.930> good<00:00:33.930> gear

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
think you can do this without good gear

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.610 
think you can do this without good gear
at<00:00:34.500> least<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> trash<00:00:35.160> clearing<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
at least the trash clearing on so if you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.139 
at least the trash clearing on so if you
don't<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.890> good<00:00:37.950> gear<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.550> always<00:00:38.910> just

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
don't have good gear you can always just

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
don't have good gear you can always just
go<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> find<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> chests<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:43.010> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
found the chests even though you can

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090

kill<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> jam<00:00:49.020> impacts<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
kill the jam impacts because you go you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.779 
kill the jam impacts because you go you
can<00:00:50.250> always<00:00:50.370> lower<00:00:51.379> cam<00:00:52.379> impacts<00:00:52.800> away<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
can always lower cam impacts away to a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.880 
can always lower cam impacts away to a
spot<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> single<00:00:56.640> spot<00:00:57.890> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
spot where it to like a single spot but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
spot where it to like a single spot but
the<00:00:59.070> trash<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> thinking<00:00:59.789> pretty<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.210> clear<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the trash I thinking pretty much clear I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.740 
the trash I thinking pretty much clear I
can<00:01:00.809> clear<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.559> MF<00:01:02.039> gear<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.239> with

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
can clear it with my MF gear on and with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.310 
can clear it with my MF gear on and with
that<00:01:03.899> i<00:01:03.960> only<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.379> 16<00:01:04.979> k<00:01:05.159> damage<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that i only have like 16 k damage but I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.090 
that i only have like 16 k damage but I
mean<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> slow<00:01:08.460> works<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> it's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
mean the slow works so good that it's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
mean the slow works so good that it's
really<00:01:11.430> no<00:01:11.580> problem<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.150> clear<00:01:12.360> any<00:01:12.780> trash<00:01:15.170> but

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
really no problem to clear any trash but

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
really no problem to clear any trash but
obviously<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> champ<00:01:17.280> acts<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
obviously it's the champ acts that are

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.570 
obviously it's the champ acts that are
hardened<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.240> even<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.540> build<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
hardened here and even with this build I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.620 
hardened here and even with this build I
all<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.820> obviously<00:01:24.210> can't<00:01:24.689> take<00:01:24.900> any<00:01:25.049> hit<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
all I obviously can't take any hit so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.590 
all I obviously can't take any hit so
when<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.960> fast<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.860> they're<00:01:28.979> unicorns

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
when they have fast and they're unicorns

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
when they have fast and they're unicorns
then<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.259> hard<00:01:31.560> because

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
then they're really really hard because

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.819 
then they're really really hard because
then<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:33.380> run<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
then they just you know run right up to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.490 
then they just you know run right up to
you<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:34.979> kill<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.630> which<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you and kill you which is one of the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
you and kill you which is one of the
reasons<00:01:37.829> why<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.280> teleport<00:01:39.140> with

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
reasons why i have teleport with

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
reasons why i have teleport with
fracture<00:01:41.990> um<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.490> keep<00:01:45.000> on

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fracture um so I'm just gonna keep on

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
fracture um so I'm just gonna keep on
going<00:01:45.390> until<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.659> find<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> champ<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> show

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
going until I find a champ back to show

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.889 
going until I find a champ back to show
you<00:01:46.860> guys<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.240> go<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.659> right

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you guys and there we go it's right

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.980 
you guys and there we go it's right
there<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.490> has<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.420> nut<00:01:51.750> back

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
there so this one has a lot nut back

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.030 
there so this one has a lot nut back
which<00:01:52.590> doesn't<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.130> affect<00:01:53.460> anything<00:01:53.930> um

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
which doesn't really affect anything um

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.719 
which doesn't really affect anything um
and<00:01:56.040> plate<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> frozen<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> waller<00:01:58.729> I'm

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and plate and frozen and waller I'm

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
and plate and frozen and waller I'm
pretty<00:02:01.670> standard<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.540> hard<00:02:03.890> since<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
pretty standard not that hard since it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.469 
pretty standard not that hard since it
doesn't<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.369> teleport<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
doesn't have teleport to get up to you

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
doesn't have teleport to get up to you
it<00:02:06.570> doesn't<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.840> fast<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.350> has<00:02:07.530> its<00:02:07.740> normal

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it doesn't it fast so has its normal

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
it doesn't it fast so has its normal
movement<00:02:08.729> speed<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.929> even<00:02:10.110> has

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
movement speed and it even has

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.309 
movement speed and it even has
wall-to-wall<00:02:11.330> itself<00:02:12.330> out<00:02:12.510> sometimes

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
wall-to-wall itself out sometimes

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890 
wall-to-wall itself out sometimes
um<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.819> frozen<00:02:15.329> can<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.659> a<00:02:15.689> bit<00:02:15.870> tricky

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
um the frozen can be a bit tricky

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
um the frozen can be a bit tricky
sometimes<00:02:16.379> with<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.890> walls<00:02:17.069> if<00:02:17.459> they<00:02:17.870> manage

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
sometimes with the walls if they manage

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.239 
sometimes with the walls if they manage
to<00:02:18.900> get<00:02:19.139> you<00:02:19.260> stuck<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:20.010> between<00:02:20.400> walls<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.239> a

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.249 
to get you stuck in between walls but a

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.920 
to get you stuck in between walls but a
pretty<00:02:23.249> manageable<00:02:23.579> as<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:23.969> can<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:24.299> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pretty manageable as you can see and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.399 
pretty manageable as you can see and
we'll<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.219> double<00:02:26.609> slow<00:02:26.849> from<00:02:27.090> marking<00:02:27.510> Hydra

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
we'll the double slow from marking Hydra

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.879 
we'll the double slow from marking Hydra
and<00:02:29.389> Blizzard<00:02:30.389> works<00:02:30.659> really<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.650> well<00:02:33.889> as

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
and Blizzard works really really well as

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.640 
and Blizzard works really really well as
you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.099> see<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:36.230> any<00:02:37.230> trouble

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you can see it is not really any trouble

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
you can see it is not really any trouble
for<00:02:37.829> me<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.099> do<00:02:38.219> this<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.659> wouldn't<00:02:39.989> matter

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
for me to do this and it wouldn't matter

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.190 
for me to do this and it wouldn't matter
if<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.530> had<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:41.159> 30<00:02:41.849> k<00:02:42.180> less<00:02:42.450> damage<00:02:42.870> they

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
if I had like 30 k less damage they

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.039 
if I had like 30 k less damage they
would<00:02:43.379> still<00:02:43.590> die<00:02:43.829> eventually<00:02:44.900> before<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
would still die eventually before the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.610 
would still die eventually before the
enrage<00:02:46.319> timer<00:02:46.819> unless<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.030> start<00:02:48.719> dying<00:02:49.469> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
enrage timer unless you start dying a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.729 
enrage timer unless you start dying a
lot<00:02:49.799> when<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:50.280> kill<00:02:50.489> these<00:02:51.199> the<00:02:52.199> enrage<00:02:52.439> timer

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
lot when you kill these the enrage timer

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.020 
lot when you kill these the enrage timer
shouldn't<00:02:53.129> really<00:02:53.219> be<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.459> problem<00:02:53.760> i<00:02:53.909> mean

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
shouldn't really be a problem i mean

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.920 
shouldn't really be a problem i mean
they<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.329> what<00:02:54.799> 1.6<00:02:55.799> million<00:02:56.010> HP<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:57.510> seems

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they have what 1.6 million HP it seems

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.509 
they have what 1.6 million HP it seems
like<00:02:58.169> a<00:02:58.199> lot<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.829> not<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.459> much

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
like a lot but it's not really that much

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.619 
like a lot but it's not really that much
I<00:03:00.090> don't<00:03:00.989> know<00:03:01.079> how<00:03:01.199> long<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:01.469> is<00:03:01.889> taking<00:03:02.629> was

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
I don't know how long this is taking was

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.580 
I don't know how long this is taking was
not<00:03:03.840> taking<00:03:04.199> that<00:03:04.230> long<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:06.139> 14<00:03:07.139> race<00:03:07.349> timer

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
not taking that long so 14 race timer

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.589 
not taking that long so 14 race timer
kicks<00:03:07.919> in<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.459> would<00:03:08.730> be<00:03:08.879> able<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.180> die<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.359> few

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
kicks in you would be able to die a few

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.949 
kicks in you would be able to die a few
times<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.109> still<00:03:10.290> kill<00:03:10.560> him<00:03:11.629> as<00:03:12.629> long<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
times and still kill him as long as you

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.839 
times and still kill him as long as you
don't<00:03:13.139> get<00:03:13.260> up<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.590> those<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:13.980> 15<00:03:14.459> second

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
don't get up to those like 15 second

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.170 
don't get up to those like 15 second
rest<00:03:14.879> times<00:03:15.329> as<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.439> can<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.709> there<00:03:16.919> I<00:03:17.609> create

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
rest times as you can see there I create

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.140 
rest times as you can see there I create
like<00:03:18.329> 120<00:03:19.109> k<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:21.109> with<00:03:22.109> my<00:03:22.259> magic<00:03:22.799> missile

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
like 120 k with my with my magic missile

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.699 
like 120 k with my with my magic missile
and<00:03:25.639> that's<00:03:26.639> like<00:03:26.849> one<00:03:27.030> sixteenth<00:03:27.599> of<00:03:27.750> Thor<00:03:28.229> HP

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and that's like one sixteenth of Thor HP

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.979 
and that's like one sixteenth of Thor HP
so<00:03:28.979> it's<00:03:29.639> pretty<00:03:29.819> simple<00:03:30.979> um<00:03:31.979> and<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:33.629> think<00:03:33.900> you

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
so it's pretty simple um and I think you

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.770 
so it's pretty simple um and I think you
can<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.229> this<00:03:34.379> with<00:03:34.439> pretty<00:03:35.340> much<00:03:35.459> any<00:03:36.060> range

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
can do this with pretty much any range

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.839 
can do this with pretty much any range
class<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.409> yeah<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:37.859> was<00:03:37.919> pretty<00:03:38.220> lucky<00:03:38.579> there

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
class and yeah I was pretty lucky there

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.819 
class and yeah I was pretty lucky there
with<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> Dutch<00:03:39.319> but<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.349> think<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.739> do

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
with the Dutch but I think you can do

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.559 
with the Dutch but I think you can do
that<00:03:40.859> with<00:03:41.129> pretty<00:03:41.370> much<00:03:41.459> any<00:03:41.639> class<00:03:41.909> that's

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
that with pretty much any class that's

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.629 
that with pretty much any class that's
range<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.139> both<00:03:43.439> witch<00:03:43.739> doctor<00:03:44.159> and<00:03:44.340> dima

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
range so both witch doctor and dima

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.149 
range so both witch doctor and dima
