again<00:03:44.630> it's<00:03:44.810> also<00:03:45.020> your<00:03:45.260> story<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:46.100> even

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
again it's also your story because even

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.460 
again it's also your story because even
though<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.670> content<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.180> split<00:03:47.480> between<00:03:47.600> sort

origin you choose also follows so in

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.970 
origin you choose also follows so in
