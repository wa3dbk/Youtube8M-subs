00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
through and twisting these individual

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.960 
through and twisting these individual
sections<00:04:10.530> i<00:04:10.709> realized<00:04:11.189> i<00:04:11.370> still<00:04:11.430> needed<00:04:11.939> to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
sections i realized i still needed to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.210 
sections i realized i still needed to
and<00:04:12.480> treat<00:04:13.409> them<00:04:13.849> so<00:04:14.849> i<00:04:15.470> would<00:04:16.470> twist<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:17.009> for

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
example it's twisting this section and I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.409 
example it's twisting this section and I
ran<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.349> a<00:04:19.410> snag<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:20.039> hair<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.940> started

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
ran to a snag in my hair so I started

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.570 
ran to a snag in my hair so I started
before<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.780> twist<00:04:22.109> each<00:04:22.289> section<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.070> started

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
before I twist each section I started

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.580 
before I twist each section I started
just<00:04:23.849> doing<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:24.539> end<00:04:24.690> with<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.990> Denman<00:04:25.380> I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
just doing the end with the Denman I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.330 
just doing the end with the Denman I
used<00:04:26.400> my<00:04:26.669> gel<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.539> set<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.960> style<00:04:28.259> this<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.220> the

eco styler mixed with the curling
souffle<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:31.860> why<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.070> used<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.940> set<00:04:33.150> this

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
souffle that's why I used to set this

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.529 
souffle that's why I used to set this

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
i don't know maybe I'll twist this up

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.300 
i don't know maybe I'll twist this up
this<00:05:51.960> way<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.500> then<00:05:52.889> flat<00:05:53.270> or<00:05:54.270> do<00:05:54.509> the<00:05:54.690> rows

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
here I don't know I can't decide but I

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:00.650 
here I don't know I can't decide but I
need<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> figure<00:05:59.819> it<00:06:00.030> out<00:06:00.090> because<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:00.509> don't

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
need to figure it out because I don't

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.600

here so this is going to be if i don't
do<00:06:09.990> a<00:06:10.020> design<00:06:10.409> because<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.009> parting<00:06:11.430> is

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
do a design because the parting is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.890 
do a design because the parting is
really<00:06:11.819> what<00:06:11.940> takes<00:06:12.150> me<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.360> long<00:06:12.479> time<00:06:12.690> i'm<00:06:12.870> a

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
really what takes me a long time i'm a

really what takes me a long time i'm a
pretty<00:06:13.169> fast<00:06:13.500> twister<00:06:14.030> if<00:06:15.030> I<00:06:15.180> don't<00:06:15.360> do<00:06:15.509> a

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
pretty fast twister if I don't do a

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.870 
pretty fast twister if I don't do a
design<00:06:15.840> that<00:06:15.900> should<00:06:16.229> take<00:06:16.380> me<00:06:16.500> 30<00:06:16.770> minutes<00:06:17.039> so

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
design that should take me 30 minutes so

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.999 
design that should take me 30 minutes so
i'll<00:06:18.449> come<00:06:18.750> back<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.110> let<00:06:19.229> you<00:06:19.349> know<00:06:19.380> what<00:06:19.889> it
