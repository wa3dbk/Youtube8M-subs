close<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.820> least<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.570> 200<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.260> don't<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
close at least to 200 I don't think I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
close at least to 200 I don't think I
actually<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.520> 200<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
actually get all the way to 200 this

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.020 
actually get all the way to 200 this
time<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.050> poor<00:00:50.039> aiming<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.760> part

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
time because of poor aiming on my part

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
time because of poor aiming on my part
and<00:00:51.620> then<00:00:52.620> after<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> you're<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and then after that you're just going to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
and then after that you're just going to
kill<00:00:54.750> yourself<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.739> this<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:58.949> allow

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
kill yourself here and this will allow

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
kill yourself here and this will allow
you<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.579> gain<00:01:00.180> eighty<00:01:00.629> ammo<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.289> will<00:01:01.469> be

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you to gain eighty ammo which will be

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
you to gain eighty ammo which will be
enough<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> kill<00:01:02.640> Pete<00:01:02.879> now

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
enough to go down and kill Pete now

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.500 
enough to go down and kill Pete now
people<00:01:04.140> also<00:01:04.290> wanted<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.729> B<00:01:06.090> would

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
people also wanted to see if the B would

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.630 
people also wanted to see if the B would
speed<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.170> kill<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
speed up this kill so I'm going to be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
speed up this kill so I'm going to be
using<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.210> B<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:10.049> down<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
using the B when I get down there it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.560 
using the B when I get down there it
doesn't<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.880> too<00:01:11.909> big<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> difference

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
doesn't make too big of a difference

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
doesn't make too big of a difference
because<00:01:12.930> obviously<00:01:13.229> once<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:13.860> hits<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> Nova

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
because obviously once he hits the Nova

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
because obviously once he hits the Nova
phase<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.140> B

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
phase you're not going to have the B

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
phase you're not going to have the B
boost<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> health<00:01:17.850> portion<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
boost for the health portion and the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
boost for the health portion and the
shield<00:01:19.290> portion<00:01:19.740> goes<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.159> quick<00:01:20.400> anyway<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
shield portion goes so quick anyway that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179 
shield portion goes so quick anyway that
the<00:01:21.210> difference<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> negligible<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the difference is kind of negligible but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
the difference is kind of negligible but
you'll<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.840> own

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you'll see and you can make your own

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380 
you'll see and you can make your own
assessment<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:25.979> much<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> helps<00:01:27.180> or

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
assessment of how much it helps or

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
assessment of how much it helps or
doesn't<00:01:27.810> help<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> second<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.610> I'm

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
doesn't help here in a second so I'm

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
doesn't help here in a second so I'm
just<00:01:29.880> gonna<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.450> critical<00:01:30.720> hit<00:01:31.020> off<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just gonna get a critical hit off this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
just gonna get a critical hit off this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
little bit and give me a follow-through

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
little bit and give me a follow-through
boost<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.110> elevator

quicker grab the shock relic and the B

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
quicker grab the shock relic and the B
obviously<00:01:41.670> I'll<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.689> using<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> trespasser

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
obviously I'll be using the trespasser
