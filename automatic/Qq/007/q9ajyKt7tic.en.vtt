00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Center down a lot of people go from the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.490 
Center down a lot of people go from the
bottom<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.689> find<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> easier<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.409> go

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
bottom up I just find it easier to go

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.429 
bottom up I just find it easier to go
from<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> center<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.990> again<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.020> pull<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
from the center down again you pull it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.920 
from the center down again you pull it
up<00:01:52.590> towards<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.640> center<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
up towards the center and I just use the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
up towards the center and I just use the
visual<00:01:55.049> center<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> cushion<00:01:56.219> that's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
visual center of the cushion that's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.740 
visual center of the cushion that's
where<00:01:56.520> I'll<00:01:56.610> stop<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.329> hand<00:01:57.540> side

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
where I'll stop on the right hand side

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.920 
where I'll stop on the right hand side
then<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.110> switch<00:01:58.890> hands<00:01:59.189> underneath<00:01:59.850> go<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then I switch hands underneath go to the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.730 
then I switch hands underneath go to the
left<00:02:01.140> hand<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:02.540> again<00:02:03.540> pull<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.380> shooing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
left hand side again pull that shooing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.240 
left hand side again pull that shooing
forward<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.479> you'll<00:02:06.930> feel<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.680> line

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
forward and you'll feel them just line

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.199 
forward and you'll feel them just line
up<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.759> top<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> other

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.850 

this<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> time<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.840> straighten<00:02:18.319> some<00:02:18.739> of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
this is the time to straighten some of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:30.930 
this is the time to straighten some of
the<00:02:18.920> frets<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:20.349> tail<00:02:21.349> itself

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.600 

so<00:02:31.510> I'm<00:02:31.660> moving<00:02:31.990> towards<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.410> center<00:02:32.740> once<00:02:33.490> I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
so I'm moving towards the center once I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.240 
so I'm moving towards the center once I
get<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.030> center<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.740> as<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.070> can<00:02:39.160> see

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
get to the center and as you can see

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.680 
get to the center and as you can see
everything's<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.760> order<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.240> like<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> deck

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
everything's in order just like a deck

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.340 
everything's in order just like a deck
the<00:02:40.810> cards

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
the cards

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800 
the cards
you<00:02:42.070> place<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.060> everything<00:02:43.330> one<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.600> top<00:02:43.750> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you place it everything one on top of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.860 
you place it everything one on top of
the<00:02:43.930> other<00:02:44.080> next<00:02:45.070> thing<00:02:45.280> I'll<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:46.660> I'll

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the other next thing I'll do is I'll

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.190 
the other next thing I'll do is I'll
look<00:02:47.020> at<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.790> center<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:50.020> could

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
look at the center here and you could

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.320 
look at the center here and you could
see<00:02:50.440> these<00:02:50.590> feathers<00:02:51.040> right<00:02:51.250> here<00:02:51.490> are<00:02:52.270> a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
see these feathers right here are a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.250 
see these feathers right here are a
little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.810> tilted<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.990> these<00:02:55.990> ones

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
little bit tilted like so these ones

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.540 
little bit tilted like so these ones
here<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> little<00:02:56.800> bit<00:02:57.010> tilted<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
here are a little bit tilted the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.580 
here are a little bit tilted the
opposite<00:02:58.030> direction<00:02:58.270> like<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.600> now<00:02:59.410> what<00:02:59.560> I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
opposite direction like that now what I

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.930 
opposite direction like that now what I
want<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.250> want<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.460> create<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.730> nice

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
want to do is I want to create a nice

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.680 
want to do is I want to create a nice
flat<00:03:01.680> surface<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.490> what<00:03:04.240> this<00:03:04.360> will<00:03:04.510> do

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
flat surface here and what this will do

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.450 
flat surface here and what this will do
is<00:03:04.810> it'll<00:03:04.990> give<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> bird<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.860> stability<00:03:06.370> in

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
is it'll give the bird the stability in

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.340 
is it'll give the bird the stability in
the<00:03:06.580> pocket<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.240> doesn't<00:03:07.540> tend<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.990> run<00:03:08.200> its

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
the pocket so it doesn't tend to run its

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.930 
the pocket so it doesn't tend to run its
head<00:03:08.500> one<00:03:08.710> way<00:03:08.950> or<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.160> other<00:03:09.280> down<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.730> side

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
head one way or the other down the side

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.540 
head one way or the other down the side
of<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> detail<00:03:10.960> if<00:03:11.530> there's<00:03:11.770> no<00:03:11.920> comfort<00:03:12.220> and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
of the detail if there's no comfort and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.070 
of the detail if there's no comfort and
there<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> bird<00:03:13.060> will<00:03:13.390> pull<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
there the bird will pull in that

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.980 
there the bird will pull in that
direction<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:15.250> lot<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.910> people<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.390> seen<00:03:16.720> this

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
direction a lot of people have seen this

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.980 
direction a lot of people have seen this
where<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:19.090> head<00:03:19.270> setting<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> little

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
where the the head setting is a little

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.050 
where the the head setting is a little
bit<00:03:20.080> off<00:03:20.260> where<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.560> turns<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.760> what<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:21.940> do

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
bit off where it turns in so what I do

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.110 
bit off where it turns in so what I do
here<00:03:22.360> is<00:03:22.720> basically<00:03:23.470> grab<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.700> base<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.060> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
here is basically grab the base of the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.270 
here is basically grab the base of the
feather<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.900> back<00:03:26.050> with<00:03:26.290> my<00:03:26.440> pointer<00:03:26.830> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
feather in the back with my pointer and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
feather in the back with my pointer and
I'll<00:03:27.580> take<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.000> because<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.810> feather<00:03:29.080> is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
I'll take this because this feather is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.560 
I'll take this because this feather is
turned<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:29.770> way<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.250> want<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.970> just<00:03:31.090> turn<00:03:31.420> it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
turned this way I want to just turn it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.590 
turned this way I want to just turn it
the<00:03:31.990> opposite<00:03:32.500> way<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.210> a<00:03:34.240> little

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
the opposite way and just get a little

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.490 
the opposite way and just get a little
bit<00:03:34.960> flatter<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.830> pocket<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.350> just

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
bit flatter in the pocket and you just

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.740 
bit flatter in the pocket and you just
go<00:03:38.680> all<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.920> right<00:03:39.190> way<00:03:39.820> around<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.270> pocket

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
go all the right way around that pocket

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
go all the right way around that pocket
area<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.950> take<00:03:47.950> those<00:03:48.160> feathers<00:03:48.550> put

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
area like so take those feathers put

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.540 
area like so take those feathers put
them<00:03:48.880> back<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.270> order<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:50.430> remember<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
them back in order and remember the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.950 
them back in order and remember the
whole<00:03:51.730> feather<00:03:52.060> has<00:03:52.330> to<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.780> top<00:03:54.840> there<00:03:55.840> we

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
whole feather has to be on top there we

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.460 
whole feather has to be on top there we
go

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
go

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.960
