00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.720
 you guys how you feel about having to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 make a new ferrari 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.929
 think about it, it's something really 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 chills and the 488 gtb the new sports car 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 here at the geneva stand is a lot 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.740
 particular very important for many 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 versi first replaces the 458 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600
 that had been a car 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 revolutionary in terms of handling of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.119
 driving dynamics has made school and then 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 and turbo is not the first modern ferrari 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 turbo because it comes after the california 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 but if you think about it the turbo in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.530
 ferrari recalls the f40 which is a bit 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.540
 supercar of children's dreams to those of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.600
 we didn't have a model or a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.270
 poster and the 488 gtv at a 3900 v8 turbo 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 670 horses between 120 per hour 0 100 in 3 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 exact seconds and 0 200 in 8.3 seconds e 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.809
 then there is the question now that if you are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.719
 car enthusiasts the fact that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 modern sports with turbo engines have 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.180
 created problems of sound drivability 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.040
 so ferrari on this gave the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 better because already on the california has 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
 introduced a couple management 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the first marches to limit we say 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 the bus pushed the tube instead 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.450
 back on high gears in recovery then 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.090
 giving driveability sound driving pleasure 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.070
 and now let's talk a little bit about 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 details why this machine 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 aesthetically live beyond 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 there are dynamic and technical functions 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.659
 behind 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 and very impressive to explain 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 because trying to make some queues 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.570
 on the hold because as you can see there are 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.229
 many people close so I want to do 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.229
 see a little better 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.070
 you can see some details on the side 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.649
 to two things that immediately hit the blade 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.500
 which divides the side air intake e 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.630
 this low handle that comes out and does 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 so from aerodynamic pin too 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.310
 maximum at most in the center 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.329
 it's very narrow it seems a bit like if 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.519
 had been shelled and maybe it is in front of it 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.190
 the closest part to what 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.459
 it concerns the headlights of the 458 italia but there is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 this is another particularity 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.400
 aileron that looks like that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.099
 of a single-seater from a race and precisely that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.440
 makes you understand how extreme 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.780
 the aerodynamics of this 488 gtb that between 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.840
 the other one I also like the idea that it is 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.430
 returned to being called with an acronym 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.569
 that instead of a name I like it 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.310
 this thing 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.980
 born in the cut that I wanted to show you 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.069
 the Latvian here is blown so this 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.349
 part involves the air to work 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.590
 dynamic the rear lights seem 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.720
 some rings and then there is Alessandro 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.880
 showed pictures of the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.400
 interior because some things have changed 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.670
 remains the steering wheel of setup and there is 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.170
 never evolved human interface machine that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.220
 it was introduced on the ferrari of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.230
 few years ago 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.480
 the side controls a little change i 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.060
 infotainment satellites is all a man 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.160
 you can also have the key without who 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.930
 it has been but these are details that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.510
 for such a car I am 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 secondary to deepen go to 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.170
 see all the articles the cards 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.930
 techniques we wrote about omniauto e 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.090
 let us know on social networks on facebook on 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.889
 twitter follow our updates e 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.079
 also comments on youtube and of course 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.079
 what do you think about this new ferrari?
