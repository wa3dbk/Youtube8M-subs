00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.120
 the bag 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.619
 the honor 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 hello hello is after a long time 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.710
 one more day from me i'm doing now 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.000
 somehow i have so much text because of me 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.740
 did not find that much interesting or 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.779
 just somehow made other videos 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.189
 have and now I have considered 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.810
 to do anything again the 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.130
 Something has to do with summer because of me 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.529
 Lately, just by the great 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.849
 Weather is our mood and tim 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.290
 Finally, have summer and now 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.540
 I found one and that is called 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.710
 summer day unit and ask it in twelve 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.450
 and I would say we just lay 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.010
 just 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.750
 I have to admit if I have the ID card 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.520
 not so big i have exactly one 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.560
 browser at home and that's it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.780
 here from the p2 inflated tel 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.210
 that's about the same in october 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.730
 year oktoberfestzeit and that is the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.330
 color 0.20 hearty green so a very 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.830
 very close 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.150
 i just love this browser because you 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.460
 to orange you, however, is 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.900
 at the same time not too dark because I as 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.730
 very pale as you can easily see 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.680
 can and as you have seen closed 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.870
 falls which means I must me so in the near 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 make future thoughts which browser 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.080
 I'll buy next because I 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.910
 I really have to say every day 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.350
 used browser and yes I have me 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.090
 describe which browser your well 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.070
 just found were blast because i was 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.000
 think there's so much this orange or 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.750
 just too dark 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.340
 therefore, on 14 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.780
 who knows my video for a long time knows 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.760
 actually that my favorite drink 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.700
 whether summer or winter actually 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.750
 always tough is next to water now and that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.250
 summer may sometimes be one 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 It's not too hot for hot tea 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.120
 Although I have to say I drink too 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.830
 I love hot tea in the summer 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.720
 cold tea and made out of use 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.700
 as raspberry peach iced tea I in 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.650
 my last video as youtube shown 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
 so if I'm interested in how 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.830
 This really delicious drink goes 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 Share in any case during the last video 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.890
 of course you can find the link in 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 the infobox and also at the end of the videos 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.040
 his co 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.810
 I could not say that on it now 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.160
 that's why it's so crucial 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.140
 Just a few men in products 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.610
 ie once are that the furniture in 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.410
 new york the willis i find 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.570
 really very good for that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.740
 summer also because they are caring for you 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.899
 reminds me a bit of solar 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.550
 but they give color and have 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.510
 at the same time only a sun protection factor 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.620
 from 15 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.540
 the robber of some mascara 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.220
 At the same time I have this peak 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.020
 is the just is a 40 minutes 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.570
 Also very nice and I have in there 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.920
 this jerry me that's mine 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.660
 favorite among those though I have to say 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 I also had this pink punch 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.300
 I also lost it somehow 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.450
 server I do not know where to go 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.200
 is soooo and a product must 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.060
 still show 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 I have that relatively new and indeed 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.320
 is this astor lippert ag vag 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.330
 sun protection factor but the color is 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.380
 just so nice for the summer that is 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.050
 just a really nice chur 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.180
 old in the color 0 11 feeling berlin 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.770
 and the consistency also love this 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.360
 not too dry and relatively nourishing 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.070
 Nevertheless, it is not that if now 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.450
 the wind comes up all over the hair or 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.930
 somehow sticking to the lips and me 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 think there is really nothing annoying 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.560
 the question somehow i think i was 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.420
 Only three times in my life in the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.400
 sea ​​swim what full little sounds 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.829
 somehow it was either too cold it was 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
 so if i was too windy it was too 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.799
 that's because the waves are so high and me 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.329
 I think I prefer swimming in the pool 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.219
 simply because I'm not so sure about the sea 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.510
 knows what is coming or what is there 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.129
 and I'm not that nice 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.420
 but otherwise if I am now 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.739
 just would be together then 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.639
 Of course I say more because I think so 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.569
 the mood on the sea 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.519
 somehow more beautiful than a pool 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.620
 Therefore I have to say the plate 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.680
 already build relatively inflation except 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.180
 drogerie tried and it was always 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.909
 catastrophic from about so I was mega 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.370
 orange or has stripes and that 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.629
 never nice secretly and that's why 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.859
 I now opt for sun though 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.719
 I had to admit it now in the 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.099
 sun never too violent brown so 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.510
 I'm getting really brown 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.769
 I would want me then 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.569
 probably again for distribution 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.420
 opt for such an effect manual 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.400
 I wanted to give you a try 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.930
 So the father's mafia swimming goes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.340
 clear or salt water I have there 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.260
 actually always had the problem that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.489
 my hair was knotted or just 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.770
 so do not misunderstand me when I see you 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.420
 I almost fought my half 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.209
 had pulled out hair and therefore 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.310
 I can tell you really, really such 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.230
 Traces suggest that he is here now two 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.360
 once by bonner clear the can 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.370
 I think only impulse buy and but 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.290
 by gliss kur and i just like that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.040
 so good the up to 1000 different 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.660
 versions 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.190
 that is now here for the sprays for 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.320
 longer and play a greasy hair 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.060
 people or will you be able to hair like that 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 combed much easier and that is 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.870
 simply a bastard product for me 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.889
 because otherwise I would probably have 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.120
 no more hair on your head 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.469
 I could not do that either 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.270
 That's why I have two days 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.949
 long for you and once one 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.770
 relatively loud and that is this 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.789
 by patrice the color 360 rettberg 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.050
 fields forever 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.599
 that 's just such a nice thing 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.729
 do pink and i love it when a 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.349
 nail polishes to remember fruit and for 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.460
 It really looks like fresh 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.509
 raspberries and I really think 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.060
 very nice 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.770
 that sounds white and then that 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.569
 second which I think is very nice 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.050
 is just so summed up the color 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.900
 nails 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.939
 that now here from p2 the color only 30 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.120
 Italy from this volume gloss series 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.889
 which I really like very much 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.930
 I believe that tradition is mine 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.400
 spontaneously comes is very late 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.560
 Eat spontaneous ice 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.060
 that is, you sit so at home by 19 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.650
 or so and then you write some 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.330
 Do not just look forward to ice cream somehow 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.310
 to go out and eat with the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.979
 bike in the brightness that I think 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.080
 just like that glue is just then 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.250
 you can in the bright still ice cream shop and 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.960
 lets just end the evening 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.240
 with a few balls of ice I think so 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.200
 that it's my summer tradition that way 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.550
 I really love very much 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.650
 now you can do what I want 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.530
 so relatively heavy pafos have the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.530
 actually not so much whether it was 21 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.960
 that susanna and that just smells like that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.340
 good that now even the big pack 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.470
 because who ever bought later 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.510
 exactly 75 milliliters that looks like that 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.270
 it just smells so good so relative 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.770
 fresh but sweet and yes I can 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.240
 should not describe how 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.070
 probably almost every youtuber 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.590
 there is a breakdown because I ask myself 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.840
 always so people how can you me 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.729
 It can not but yes the call really 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.960
 really really good 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.699
 i think i would go for that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.259
 grilled feta cheese with tomatoes 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.870
 decide and he is so easy to 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.889
 but make incredibly delicious and indeed 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.659
 I'm just doing so small 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.249
 ships from aluminum foil and there comes 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.020
 bit feta cheese rhein a bit 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.729
 olive oil a few herbs and a few 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.469
 small tomatoes and then you think it 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.059
 just on the grill and then it melts 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.279
 the feta cheese and you can still do that 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.469
 eat something salad or bread or something 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:24.050
 Whatever and I think that's the way it is 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.460
 says the countess 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.930
 I already have the product in the last one 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.840
 seen video and be it the cat 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.159
 glamor boy mascara in waterproof and me 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.509
 I must say I wear a waterproof one 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.800
 mascara throughout the year 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.000
 but I find this particularly well 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.919
 simply because you are very much looking forward to it 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.180
 can leave that it is waterproof 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.069
 and that you can not do it at the end of the day 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.599
 looks like a panda heat too 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.440
 black eyes because you are a bit 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.440
 siblings or something 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.409
 no summer panel for this year 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.119
 simply because it's not that good in time 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.109
 you know, yes I 'm going to college 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:53.209
 and then I'll make this year 

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:54.109
 internship and there is just too little 

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.839
 time or 

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:58.429
 it would be too stressful and yes 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.659
 if I would decide and where 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:00.889
 I would start it would be 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:04.189
 I probably have South Africa 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.689
 ever said or an island or 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:06.829
 Barcelona would be very cool too 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.809
 is not quite there yet 

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:10.999
 oh people if you could vacation again 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:13.189
 I would like to do everything dubai would like 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.359
 I am also very very very tempted by that 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.649
 I will definitely do it 

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:17.269
 hopefully maybe next year 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.009
 or so that was already all 

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:20.059

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.219
