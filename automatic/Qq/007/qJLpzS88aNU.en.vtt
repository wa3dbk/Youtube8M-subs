and<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.669> Revere<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.450> probably<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.460> it's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and like Revere it probably in a it's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.620 
and like Revere it probably in a it's
still<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.390> making

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
still just this thing that I'm making

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
still just this thing that I'm making
with<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:36.840> friends<00:00:37.850> how<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:38.969> find<00:00:39.180> writers

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
with my friends how do we find writers

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
with my friends how do we find writers
it's<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.350> difficult<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.579> because

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it's it's difficult I think because

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's it's difficult I think because
every<00:00:41.940> show<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.360> subjective<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.260> humor<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
every show is subjective the humor of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
every show is subjective the humor of
what<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.100> looking<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.730> style<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
what we're looking for and the style of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
what we're looking for and the style of
drawing<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> we're<00:00:45.690> looking<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.320> search

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
drawing that we're looking for we search

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
drawing that we're looking for we search
on<00:00:46.710> blogs<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> conventions

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
on blogs a lot and we go to conventions

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
on blogs a lot and we go to conventions

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
mean you can send out score board tests

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
mean you can send out score board tests
to<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> questions<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> test<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to one of the questions on the test is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.520 
to one of the questions on the test is
plugging<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> dialogue<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.410> these

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
plugging the dialogue for these

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
plugging the dialogue for these
characters<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> second<00:01:00.000> part<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
characters and then the second part of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
characters and then the second part of
the<00:01:00.449> page<00:01:00.660> says<00:01:00.980> rewrite<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the page says rewrite it and make it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
the page says rewrite it and make it
funnier<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.750> push<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.140> push<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
funnier like push it push it make it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.469 
funnier like push it push it make it
weirder<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.580> find<00:01:05.850> people<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
weirder that's how we find people we

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.520 
weirder that's how we find people we
found<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> people<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.320> through

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
found a lot of people just through

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
found a lot of people just through
conventions<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.479> think<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:09.659> still<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
conventions I think there's still a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
conventions I think there's still a
range<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.830> Ages<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.729> shows<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.240> shooting

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
range of Ages that shows you're shooting

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
range of Ages that shows you're shooting
towards<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.979> show<00:01:14.220> walks<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.670> line

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
towards so I think our show walks a line

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
towards so I think our show walks a line
the<00:01:15.570> helm<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.140> rhyme<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.560> reason

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the helm that there's no rhyme or reason

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.929 
the helm that there's no rhyme or reason
to<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.460> stuff<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.820> were

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to it it's just stuff that we were

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
to it it's just stuff that we were
interested<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.330> doing<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.320> types

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
interested in doing because those types

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
interested in doing because those types
of<00:01:19.830> shows<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.100> always<00:01:20.340> appealed<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> me<00:01:20.820> like

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of shows have always appealed to me like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
of shows have always appealed to me like
Ren<00:01:21.210> Stimpy<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.930> walk<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.619> kind

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
Ren Stimpy I think walk to the same kind

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.370 
Ren Stimpy I think walk to the same kind
of<00:01:22.860> line<00:01:23.070> he's<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> Butthead<00:01:24.060> too<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
of line he's a Butthead too and the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
of line he's a Butthead too and the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
walk that same kind of line like kids

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.499 
walk that same kind of line like kids
watched<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.880> watched<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.390> was
