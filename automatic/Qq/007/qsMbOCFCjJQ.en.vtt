of<00:00:21.240> course<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.810> tebow<00:00:22.080> has<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> great

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
of course with tebow has been a great

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
of course with tebow has been a great
bet<00:00:22.890> they've<00:00:23.130> been<00:00:23.279> an<00:00:23.369> underdog<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.880> think

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
bet they've been an underdog I think

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.269 
bet they've been an underdog I think
like<00:00:24.180> six<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.600> seven<00:00:24.779> weeks<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> row<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> one

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
like six or seven weeks in a row and one

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
like six or seven weeks in a row and one
out<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.760> most<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> those<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.380> they're

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
out right most of those I think they're

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.870 
out right most of those I think they're
on<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> five<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:28.980> six<00:00:29.279> streak<00:00:29.519> now<00:00:29.699> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
on like a five or six streak now but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
on like a five or six streak now but
here<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.420> they<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.199> time<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
here now they are for the first time a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.180 
here now they are for the first time a
favor<00:00:32.130> three<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> half<00:00:32.940> points<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.570> home

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190

against<00:00:35.190> Chicago<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:35.760> normally<00:00:36.149> I'd<00:00:36.270> be

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390

leaning to towards betting against
Denver<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> become<00:00:39.600> a

Denver when they start to become a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.030 
Denver when they start to become a

here in this contest I just don't see

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
here in this contest I just don't see
how<00:01:38.850> chicago<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.079> anything

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
how chicago is going to get anything

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
how chicago is going to get anything
done<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> offensive<00:01:42.360> line<00:01:42.540> was<00:01:42.930> brutal

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
done the offensive line was brutal

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
done the offensive line was brutal
against<00:01:43.799> Kansas<00:01:44.250> City<00:01:44.280> last<00:01:44.759> week<00:01:45.119> Kansas

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
against Kansas City last week Kansas

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
against Kansas City last week Kansas
City<00:01:46.140> came<00:01:46.860> into<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> game<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.640> with

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
City came into the game I think with

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.690 
City came into the game I think with
something<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.479> seven<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.470> ten<00:01:49.950> sacks<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
something like seven or ten sacks on the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
something like seven or ten sacks on the
year<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> half<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
year and they got you know half of that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.569 
year and they got you know half of that
total<00:01:53.070> amount<00:01:53.549> last<00:01:54.119> week<00:01:54.570> again<00:01:55.229> Chicago<00:01:55.950> so

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
total amount last week again Chicago so

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.209 
total amount last week again Chicago so

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.240 
totals get really really low are there
ever<00:02:32.540> NFL<00:02:33.170> games<00:02:33.410> when<00:02:33.860> you're<00:02:33.980> not<00:02:34.100> counting

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
ever NFL games when you're not counting

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.280 
ever NFL games when you're not counting
whether<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.630> are<00:02:35.660> still<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> good

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
whether that actually are still a good

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.600 
whether that actually are still a good
bet<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> under<00:02:37.010> what<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.250> take<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.489> these

lines<00:02:37.790> uh<00:02:38.590> yeah<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:40.160> could<00:02:40.280> be

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
lines uh yeah I think there could be

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.710 
lines uh yeah I think there could be
value<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:40.940> onion<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.209> mean<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.420> make<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
value to the onion I mean I make the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.660 
value to the onion I mean I make the
number<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.019> this<00:02:42.080> game<00:02:42.290> 39<00:02:42.769> but<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.400> number

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
number in this game 39 but that number

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.180 
number in this game 39 but that number
is<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.510> know<00:02:44.630> assuming<00:02:45.080> Jake<00:02:45.410> they're<00:02:46.040> here

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.780 
you've got a lot of jay cutler obviously
built<00:02:51.230> into<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.860> whatnot<00:02:52.250> yeah

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
built into that and whatnot yeah

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.949 
built into that and whatnot yeah
obviously<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> only<00:02:53.480> problem<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.840> going

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
obviously the only problem with going

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.559 
obviously the only problem with going
under<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.100> low<00:02:55.610> total<00:02:55.850> like<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.420> get<00:02:56.540> a

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
under in a low total like that you get a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.330 
under in a low total like that you get a
couple<00:02:56.900> things<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.230> happen<00:02:57.560> defensive

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
couple things that happen defensive

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.309 
couple things that happen defensive
scores<00:02:58.580> special<00:02:59.000> teams<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.360> on<00:02:59.420> what<00:02:59.630> not<00:02:59.780> it

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
scores special teams go on what not it

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.410 
scores special teams go on what not it
can<00:03:00.530> screw<00:03:00.799> that<00:03:00.950> up<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.970> way<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.209> game

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
can screw that up but the way this game

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.759 
can screw that up but the way this game
is<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.720> play<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.110> mean<00:03:03.440> Denver's

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
is going to play out I mean Denver's

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.110 
is going to play out I mean Denver's
going<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.010> run<00:03:04.130> continue<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.640> run<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.880> ball<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
going to run continue to run the ball I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.170 
going to run continue to run the ball I
think<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:06.280> Chicago<00:03:07.280> has<00:03:07.370> been<00:03:07.519> horrible<00:03:07.880> with

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
think and Chicago has been horrible with
