size but my Diane megaminx does have
ridges<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> help<00:00:30.779> grip<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> cube<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.160> get

ridges to help grip the cube you can get
the<00:00:32.460> Diane<00:00:32.700> megaminx<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.300> without<00:00:33.600> ridges<00:00:33.960> as

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the Diane megaminx is without ridges as

the Diane megaminx is without ridges as
well<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> personally<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.219> them<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
well but I personally see them as a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850 
well but I personally see them as a
major<00:00:35.760> plus<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:37.170> turning<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> shank

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
major plus the turning on the shank

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
major plus the turning on the shank
channel<00:00:38.100> megaminx<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.879> fast<00:00:39.149> although

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
channel megaminx is really fast although

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.190 
channel megaminx is really fast although
it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> somewhat<00:00:40.140> lucky

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
it is somewhat lucky

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
it is somewhat lucky
Diane<00:00:43.200> megaminx<00:00:43.590> has<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> very<00:00:44.100> bumpy<00:00:44.309> feel<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
Diane megaminx has a very bumpy feel to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
Diane megaminx has a very bumpy feel to
it<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.300> also<00:00:45.450> quite<00:00:45.780> fast<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.469> some

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it but it's also quite fast on some

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
it but it's also quite fast on some
sides<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.760> sluggish<00:00:48.000> although<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
sides it is a bit sluggish although I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.270 
sides it is a bit sluggish although I
think<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.960> only<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> problem<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> line<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
think that's only a problem on line on

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
think that's only a problem on line on
both<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> shangzhou<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.690> i<00:00:51.719> highly

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
both the shangzhou and i on i highly

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
both the shangzhou and i on i highly
recommend<00:00:52.530> loosening<00:00:52.920> them<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.190> much<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
recommend loosening them as much as you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920 
recommend loosening them as much as you
can<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.239> performance<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> much

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
can because the performance is much

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.189 
can because the performance is much
improved<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.300> corner<00:00:57.570> cutting<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> shank

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
improved the corner cutting on the shank

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.080 
improved the corner cutting on the shank
show<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.800> line<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> line<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.789> die<00:00:59.969> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
show is around line to line the die on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.490 
show is around line to line the die on
can<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
can actually go a little more but it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
can actually go a little more but it
does<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:02.070> force<00:01:02.340> reverse<00:01:03.059> corner

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
does take some force reverse corner

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
does take some force reverse corner
cutting<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.409> problem<00:01:04.769> on

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
cutting is really the only problem on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
cutting is really the only problem on
the<00:01:04.979> shank<00:01:05.159> show<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.909> cannot<00:01:06.150> really<00:01:06.330> reverse

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the shank show it cannot really reverse

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
the shank show it cannot really reverse
cut<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.170> which<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.590> sure<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.040> most

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
cut at all which I'm sure is where most

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
cut at all which I'm sure is where most
of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> lockup<00:01:08.880> stem<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.900> Diane<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.380> reverse

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of the lockup stem the Diane can reverse

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.039 
of the lockup stem the Diane can reverse
cut<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.220> more<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.670> still<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.030> much

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.300 

popping<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.320> isn't<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> problem<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.130> either

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
popping really isn't a problem on either

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
popping really isn't a problem on either
I<00:01:17.549> did<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.330> huge<00:01:18.630> explosion<00:01:19.229> recently<00:01:19.619> on

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I did get one huge explosion recently on

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
I did get one huge explosion recently on
my<00:01:19.770> die<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.400> that's<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.640> rare<00:01:21.799> overall<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
my die on but that's very rare overall I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
my die on but that's very rare overall I
could<00:01:23.159> honestly<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.700> either<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> these

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
could honestly use either one of these

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
could honestly use either one of these
as<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.750> main<00:01:24.960> although<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> moment<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> do

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
as my main although at the moment I do

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
as my main although at the moment I do
slightly<00:01:26.400> prefer<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> shank<00:01:27.240> show<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
slightly prefer my shank show they have

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
slightly prefer my shank show they have
their<00:01:28.320> ups<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.590> downs<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.220> general<00:01:29.520> they

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
their ups and downs but in general they

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
their ups and downs but in general they
are<00:01:29.670> both<00:01:29.850> pretty<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.869> both<00:01:31.049> are<00:01:31.229> nice

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
are both pretty good they both are nice

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
are both pretty good they both are nice

and fast and corner cutting is decent
