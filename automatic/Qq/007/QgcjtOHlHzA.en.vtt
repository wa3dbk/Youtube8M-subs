00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
really good job with blur with widgets

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.700 
really good job with blur with widgets
so<00:01:27.100> I've<00:01:27.220> got<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.400> messaging<00:01:28.210> widget<00:01:28.479> here

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so I've got the messaging widget here

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.930 
so I've got the messaging widget here
it's<00:01:29.710> pretty<00:01:29.830> cool<00:01:30.130> from<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.520> messaging
