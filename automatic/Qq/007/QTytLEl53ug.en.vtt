I know in the midst of my free-forming I
started<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.940> began<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:20.060> manipulate<00:00:21.060> my<00:00:21.180> hair<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
started I began to manipulate my hair a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590 
started I began to manipulate my hair a
bit<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.500> starting<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> twist<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:24.300> break

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
bit you know starting to twist or break

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.689 
bit you know starting to twist or break
some<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.140> ones<00:00:25.439> apart<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:26.039> realizing

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
some of the ones apart not realizing

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.960 
some of the ones apart not realizing
that<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.810> through<00:00:28.019> its<00:00:28.170> natural

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
that it was going through its natural

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.950 
that it was going through its natural
design<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.990> since<00:00:32.000> allowed<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.270> hair<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
design I have since allowed my hair to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920 
design I have since allowed my hair to
form<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.820> needs<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
form the way that it needs to and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.799 
form the way that it needs to and
learned<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.770> great<00:00:38.160> technique<00:00:38.750> how<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
learned a great technique how to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
learned a great technique how to
separate<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.980> locs

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
separate my locs

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
separate my locs
and<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.710> allow<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.100> should<00:00:44.309> say<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:45.390> touch<00:00:45.870> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and or allow I should say my touch in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150 
and or allow I should say my touch in
the<00:00:46.410> design<00:00:47.270> of<00:00:48.270> my<00:00:49.079> hair<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the design of my hair and the way that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.299 
the design of my hair and the way that
it<00:00:50.309> forms<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.840> since<00:00:52.140> its<00:00:52.379> locking<00:00:53.010> in

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it forms you know since its locking in

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.680 
it forms you know since its locking in
its<00:00:53.460> own<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.710> now<00:00:55.710> allowing<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.690> be

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
its own way and now allowing it to be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
its own way and now allowing it to be
the<00:00:58.320> way<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> want<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> grows<00:00:59.789> in

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the way I want it to be when it grows in

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.630 
the way I want it to be when it grows in
so<00:01:01.340> starting<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.739> root<00:01:05.630> like<00:01:06.630> this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
so starting from be the root like this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.810 
so starting from be the root like this
allowing<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> hair<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.890> separate<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
allowing my hair to separate from the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.399 
allowing my hair to separate from the
root<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.360> way<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:14.040> form<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
root that way you can see some form of

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.499 
root that way you can see some form of
part<00:01:16.409> may<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.700> part<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.240> hair

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
part may not see much part in my hair

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.440 
part may not see much part in my hair
especially<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.619> since<00:01:20.030> they're<00:01:21.830> technically

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
especially now since they're technically

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.240 
especially now since they're technically
growing<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.659> big<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.070> share
