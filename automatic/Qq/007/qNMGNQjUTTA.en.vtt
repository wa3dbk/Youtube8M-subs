then you want to just cut the beet in

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.500 
then you want to just cut the beet in
half<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:39.550> get<00:00:39.700> this<00:00:39.910> shape<00:00:40.180> but<00:00:40.390> we're

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
half so you get this shape but we're

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.970 
half so you get this shape but we're
just<00:00:40.690> gonna<00:00:40.809> start<00:00:41.110> with<00:00:41.170> this<00:00:41.410> shape<00:00:41.620> lay<00:00:41.770> out

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
just gonna start with this shape lay out

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.869 
just gonna start with this shape lay out
some<00:00:42.309> paper<00:00:42.610> take<00:00:43.420> your<00:00:43.600> beads<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.579> press

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
some paper take your beads you can press

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.410 
some paper take your beads you can press
them<00:00:46.149> into<00:00:47.160> designs<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.520> works<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:49.030> lot<00:00:49.149> better

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
them into designs it works a lot better

00:00:49.420 --> 00:01:25.090 
them into designs it works a lot better
if<00:00:49.629> you<00:00:49.780> do<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:50.020> fast<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.719> see<00:01:17.970> okay

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.609 

you<00:01:25.729> can<00:01:25.909> use<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.060> as<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> crayon<00:01:26.630> or<00:01:27.020> as<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.229> stamp

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
you can use it as a crayon or as a stamp

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.740 
you can use it as a crayon or as a stamp
for<00:01:27.890> younger<00:01:28.130> ages<00:01:28.220> older<00:01:29.060> ages<00:01:29.390> might<00:01:29.540> want

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
for younger ages older ages might want

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.390 
for younger ages older ages might want
to<00:01:29.780> actually<00:01:30.140> carve<00:01:30.320> something<00:01:30.590> out<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:30.920> it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
to actually carve something out of it

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160 
to actually carve something out of it
so<00:01:31.520> I'll<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:31.820> carve<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.240> heart<00:01:32.570> out<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:33.020> this

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
so I'll just carve a heart out of this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.870 
so I'll just carve a heart out of this
one<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.799> key<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.190> really<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.640> to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
one so the key is you really want to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.760 
one so the key is you really want to
make<00:01:35.000> sure<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.360> stays<00:01:35.420> nice<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.140> flat<00:01:36.380> a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
make sure this stays nice and flat a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.499 
make sure this stays nice and flat a
larger<00:01:37.250> knife<00:01:37.460> might<00:01:37.850> make<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.299> little

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
larger knife might make that a little

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.749 
larger knife might make that a little
bit<00:01:38.780> easier<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.200> make<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:39.590> flat<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.520> cut

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
bit easier to make it flat so just cut

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.910 
bit easier to make it flat so just cut
through<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.149> first<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:42.649> just<00:01:42.799> think

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
through it first and then just think

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.560 
through it first and then just think
you're<00:01:43.100> making<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.490> stamp<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.030> whatever<00:01:44.299> part

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
you're making a stamp so whatever part

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.029 
you're making a stamp so whatever part
you<00:01:44.600> want<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.899> print<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.229> needs<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.649> be<00:01:45.770> higher

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
you want to print it needs to be higher

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.370 
you want to print it needs to be higher
than<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.460> other<00:01:46.610> part<00:01:46.970> cut<00:01:47.420> off<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.840> end<00:01:48.020> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
than the other part cut off the end and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.170 
than the other part cut off the end and
then<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.619> can<00:01:48.740> use<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> skewer<00:01:49.250> or<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.549> pen<00:01:49.909> or<00:01:50.149> a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
then you can use a skewer or a pen or a

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.850 
then you can use a skewer or a pen or a
toothpick<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:50.990> I'm<00:01:51.080> just<00:01:51.200> gonna<00:01:51.320> draw<00:01:51.680> a

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
toothpick and I'm just gonna draw a

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.539 
toothpick and I'm just gonna draw a
heart<00:01:52.570> like<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.720> use<00:01:54.680> your<00:01:54.890> skewer<00:01:55.220> your

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
heart like this use your skewer your

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.300 
heart like this use your skewer your
toothpick<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.210> carve<00:01:56.450> down<00:01:56.690> into<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> press<00:01:58.009> in

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
toothpick to carve down into it press in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.309 
toothpick to carve down into it press in
and<00:01:58.610> then<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.000> take<00:01:59.240> your<00:01:59.420> knife<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.630> you

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
and then you take your knife and you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.940 
and then you take your knife and you
just<00:02:00.649> slowly<00:02:00.979> start<00:02:01.399> cutting<00:02:01.729> into<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.950> so

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
just slowly start cutting into it so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.800 
just slowly start cutting into it so
after<00:02:04.220> you<00:02:04.310> get<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.580> carved<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:05.240> raised

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
after you get it carved so it's raised

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.930 
after you get it carved so it's raised
up<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.319> little<00:02:06.500> bit<00:02:06.679> like<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.890> stamp<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.610> can<00:02:07.670> get

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
up a little bit like a stamp you can get

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.199 
up a little bit like a stamp you can get
your<00:02:08.060> paper<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.110> can<00:02:09.229> steel<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.120> it

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
your paper and you can steel and if it

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.820 
your paper and you can steel and if it
starts<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.630> get<00:02:14.720> kind<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.989> dull<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.620> kind

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
starts to get kind of dull you can kind

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.490 
starts to get kind of dull you can kind
of<00:02:15.920> try<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.160> rub<00:02:16.489> some<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.049> beat<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:18.350> it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of try to rub some of the beat so it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.050 
of try to rub some of the beat so it
comes<00:02:18.799> back<00:02:19.040> up<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.670> that's<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
comes back up and so that's how you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.030 
comes back up and so that's how you
would<00:02:20.239> make<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> simple<00:02:20.870> shape<00:02:21.080> stamp<00:02:21.440> out<00:02:21.890> of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
would make a simple shape stamp out of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.620 
would make a simple shape stamp out of
the<00:02:22.130> beat<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.790> could<00:02:22.940> make<00:02:23.090> wrapping<00:02:23.450> paper

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the beat you could make wrapping paper

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.080 
the beat you could make wrapping paper
you<00:02:23.810> could<00:02:24.170> make<00:02:24.319> artwork<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.549> decorate<00:02:25.880> food

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
you could make artwork you decorate food
