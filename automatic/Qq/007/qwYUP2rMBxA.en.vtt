00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
challenge I know that one Twinkie

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.670 
Twinkie is delicious but eating a whole
box<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.220> ten<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:30.470> seems<00:00:31.910> not<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.680> good

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
box of ten of them seems not that good

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.209 
box of ten of them seems not that good
for<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.210> let's<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.600> each<00:00:36.960> says<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
for you let's see what each says that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.380 
for you let's see what each says that
serving<00:00:39.000> size<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.930> cakes<00:00:41.180> that's<00:00:42.230> 270<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
serving size is two cakes that's 270 so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.560 
serving size is two cakes that's 270 so
it's<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.780> oh<00:00:48.140> my<00:00:49.140> goodness<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:50.160> math<00:00:50.370> sucks

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.630 

so<00:00:54.570> whatever<00:00:55.370> 270<00:00:56.370> times<00:00:56.610> five<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:59.489> not

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so whatever 270 times five is it's not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.439 
so whatever 270 times five is it's not
that<00:00:59.850> bad

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.670 

do<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> quick<00:01:03.660> math<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.500> look

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
do a quick math on that little look

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.670 
do a quick math on that little look
there's<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> answer<00:01:06.290> all<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.590> I'm

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
there's the answer all right so I'm

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
there's the answer all right so I'm
gonna<00:01:07.799> open<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.240> I'm

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
gonna open these all up because I'm

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.870 
gonna open these all up because I'm
gonna<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.689> how<00:01:09.840> fast<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> eat<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.549> whole

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
gonna see how fast but I can eat a whole

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.010 
gonna see how fast but I can eat a whole
box<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.570> Twinkies<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:14.330> they<00:01:15.330> stopped<00:01:15.570> making

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
box of Twinkies and they stopped making

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
box of Twinkies and they stopped making
Twinkies<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> while<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> few<00:01:17.670> months

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
Twinkies for a while for a few months

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
Twinkies for a while for a few months
and<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.900> other<00:01:19.020> company<00:01:19.680> bought

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and I think some other company bought

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
and I think some other company bought
them<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.400> something<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.869> they're

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
them up or something and they they're

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
them up or something and they they're
cranking<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.920> back<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.610> says<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cranking them back out that says the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.210 
cranking them back out that says the
sweetest<00:01:24.619> comeback<00:01:25.619> ever

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.740 

so<00:01:29.220> let<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.430> take<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> moment<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> unwrap<00:01:30.570> all

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
so let me take a moment and unwrap all

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
so let me take a moment and unwrap all
my<00:01:30.900> Twinkies<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.340> Twinkies<00:01:32.970> are

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
my Twinkies all right Twinkies are

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
my Twinkies all right Twinkies are
unwrapped<00:01:33.630> probably<00:01:34.259> took<00:01:34.409> me<00:01:34.560> longer<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
unwrapped probably took me longer to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.630 
unwrapped probably took me longer to
unwrap<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.450> eat<00:01:37.290> them

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
unwrap all that it is going to eat them

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.330 
unwrap all that it is going to eat them
and<00:01:40.159> I'm<00:01:41.570> gonna<00:01:42.570> set<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> stopwatch<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.100> I'll

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and I'm gonna set a stopwatch and I'll

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
and I'm gonna set a stopwatch and I'll
see<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.670> fast<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.240> takes<00:01:45.509> me<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> we'll<00:01:46.140> have

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
see how fast it takes me and we'll have

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.000 
see how fast it takes me and we'll have
some<00:01:46.680> milk

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010
