00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
the whole world yet this must be the

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.389 
the whole world yet this must be the
edge<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> map<00:01:06.619> how<00:01:07.619> far<00:01:07.859> away<00:01:08.069> from<00:01:08.100> here

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399
