00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
little bit so we'll go ahead and take a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.910 
little bit so we'll go ahead and take a
look<00:02:59.340> at<00:02:59.490> that<00:03:00.110> as<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.710> they've

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
look at that as you can see they've

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.950 
look at that as you can see they've
added<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.580> couple<00:03:02.820> new<00:03:02.970> categories<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.750> and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
added a couple new categories here and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.650 
added a couple new categories here and
then<00:03:04.170> split<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.070> more<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.520> put<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.090> believe

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
then split up the more and put I believe

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.930 
then split up the more and put I believe
they<00:03:06.780> had<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:07.350> things<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.190> more<00:03:08.400> section
