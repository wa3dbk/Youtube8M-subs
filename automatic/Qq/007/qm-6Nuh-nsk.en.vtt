00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.000 

they<00:04:15.670> look<00:04:15.880> like<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.140> dreamcatcher<00:04:17.140> version

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
they look like a dreamcatcher version

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.750 
they look like a dreamcatcher version
don't<00:04:18.670> they

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
don't they

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.780 
don't they
Native<00:04:21.760> Americans<00:04:22.860> they<00:04:23.860> have<00:04:24.100> those<00:04:24.460> dream

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
Native Americans they have those dream

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.940 
Native Americans they have those dream
catchers<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.330> we<00:04:25.720> hang<00:04:25.930> on<00:04:26.110> their<00:04:26.290> bed<00:04:26.530> and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
catchers that we hang on their bed and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.480 
catchers that we hang on their bed and
near<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.340> beds

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.720 

I<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:31.150> he'd<00:04:31.240> only<00:04:31.390> say<00:04:31.660> many<00:04:31.960> women<00:04:32.260> always

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
I think he'd only say many women always

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.120 
I think he'd only say many women always
exhausted<00:04:33.730> since<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.900> boys<00:04:35.110> spent<00:04:35.650> half<00:04:35.980> of

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
exhausted since the boys spent half of

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.850 
exhausted since the boys spent half of
my<00:04:36.340> salary<00:04:36.550> here<00:04:37.320> now<00:04:38.320> she<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.680> obviously

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
my salary here now she is obviously
