 you can become so perfect 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.830
 simply with a damp cloth 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.540
 Wipe off a bit because the color is 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.130
 Water dissolves so gets it all 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.560
 her too off again until the cup 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.730

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.150
 have painted 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.870

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.770
 I have something similar to 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.409

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.190

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.190
 different types of tea 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.430
 a decorative box 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.840
 preferably several teabags in my 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.610
 I did not have any 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.610
 a bowl of best teachers 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 an adhesive 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.340
 needles thread 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.970
 a small scoop or a spoon 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 the shovel for you sooo sweet 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 donor and beautiful paper 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.360
 so if they are not empty 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.730
 tea bags you can have the tea bags 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.110
 just make it from another t's on 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.040
 a bit difficult but if it is 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.780
 then you can do the tea 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.780
 just fill in and fill nine rows 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 May 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 best what this kink in the bottom 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.819
 otherwise you can not do it properly anymore 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.819
 to do nicely 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.849
 if you feel your here it 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.849
 quite simply increase again 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.680
 think of it one side of the cord 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.840
 Allow longer because there should be synonymous 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.770
 I still hang the little pendants 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.770
 do not know how to call it 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.220
 fri 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.239
 the coming of course, how to shape 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.269
 I just got a little one 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.280
 Template taken as sizes template and 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.890
 with two different paper types 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.620
 So I worked so well once 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.750
 dotted paper yes red white paper 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.129
 called and thus shear a pattern 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.150
 so brown the paper still cut out 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.150
 a little bit smaller of course 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.970
 then here I have simply 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.540
 glued on each other and of course 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.540
 lettered 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.840
 heels 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.670
 then only a small hole would have 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.670
 Prick and the thread by wag 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.370

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.740

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.599

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.550
 different kinds of chocolate 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.810
 mixed together and think because the 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.639
 Microwave put I believe in total 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.979

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.060
 ever guess in 30 seconds intervals 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.919
 to do the whole thing 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.659
 bremen again to look back at us 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.860
 everything is okay so then completely just like that 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:38.599
 you want us to do that 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.979
 Incidentally, different varieties are very good 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.580
 tasted together just like that 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.580
 information 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.690
 is 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.950
 then the chopsticks come to all that 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.870
 You could wait a bit 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.700
 It has cooled down but that 's the way it works 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.870
 you can just put it in and watch it 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.870
 that they are standing halfway 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.080

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.580
 Decorate as you want I have 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.480

 Pull off the vampire and hold the whole thing 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.220

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.400
