00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello my name is gabriel barrÃ³n de 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.790
 indicated technologies consultant 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.020
 IT implementer of new 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.340
 technologies for companies and 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.230
 professionals 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 Now he introduced you to this new tutorial and 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.769
 I hope you enjoy 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.150
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.950
 do to repair a font especially 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.750
 when the propeller starts to slow down or 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.450
 begins to make a lot of noise the source in 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.600
 this case this source does not do much 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.930
 noise but if it turns slow now we're going 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.930
 to learn 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.050
 it's like how to see just pay it for us 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 it kept turning if it did not stop at 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.810
 followed what we have to do is 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.200
 take out the screws that we have here in 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.090
 the four points and then we take the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.370
 screws that are here holding the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 fan and we're going to put this 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:13.540
 wv 80 oil that has Teflon before 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.690
 open it let's unplug the cndh for 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.580
 be sure that we did not electrocute 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.280
 moss once unplugged the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.830
 source we learn back by 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.590
 doubts in case it's loaded with 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.369
 electricity the capacitors that do not 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.369
 give current 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 this once we open it 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 we see the fan here what we are going to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.100
 do going to take it out we're going to take out the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.380
 screws that we see here there are some 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.260
 sources that have this fan 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 cost but in this case it has it here 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 same is the same 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.170
 here what I 'm going to do, I'm going to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.459
 unplug that will be easier for 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.780
 be able to work 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.000
 There are some sources that come with 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.750
 this plug if they do not come directly 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.750
 welded 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.709
 another thing that I just realized 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.819
 attack here has the place to be able 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.100
 put the oil depends on the type of 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.420
 fan of this entry because they are 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.420
 in other places 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.200
 we were slowly taking off the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.860
 label here has got a piece here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.810
 of woman that is what keeps covered 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.930
 to the fan yes yes we see it well this 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.790
 is a cap that fits and perfect 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.280
 so we try to rotate it as 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.710
 we can see it is locked and the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.440
 fan right away what are we going to 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.140
 do we are going to put it now twice as 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.350
 80 any lubricant that you always use 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.350
 try to put something with plans 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.110
 you have to shake it well 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.739
 and we put a droplet is more than 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.739
 enough now we start spinning 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.950
 if you want to make it spin faster 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.700
 that with the finger obviously be able 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.780
 use this blower black eyed maker 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.770
 is very good for this kind of thing 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.700
 it even has to regulate the speed 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.700
 take it out let's blow a little 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.520
 and there we can see 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.170
 that is, we turn it around and it's a bit 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.640
 looser if necessary we put a 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.640
 little bit more oil 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.630
 as we can see 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.640
 help you know enough that what 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.710
 we can do is blow a little more and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.260
 that should be all also another 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.580
 thing you have to do is move it 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.639
 up and down so that the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.349
 oil penetrate the entire engine 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.349
 and can sign well 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.470
 in the turns with the hand and there it rotates 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 quite and you do not understand right away 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.520
 continue with the momentum 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.990
 well once we finish on paper 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.940
 let's say where is sandblasted with oil 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.689
 so that later we can put the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.449
 tape back and do not take off 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.909
 normally this tape can not be 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.819
 hit again so let's take out the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:59.529
 stopper cited what are we going to put there and how 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.849
 we can see the well-grasped 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.959
 let's clean it 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.959
 the best possible 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.270
 I have this tape that can not be 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.940
 use any type of tape as if 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.950
 was the adopt tape that is gray or some 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.840
 packing tape that is good we cut 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.710
 a bit we put here 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.270
 so the plug that does not come out and ready and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.730
 it was like new 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.800
 there are some fans if they are very 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.500
 damaged because they were sending a lot 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.730
 time without the location directly you 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.670
 I recommend changing the fan 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:38.820
 complete but if the damage is little 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.280
 you can do what I did recently and 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.850
 If you return within a few weeks, do the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.139
 same defect put a fan that 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.240
 have ball bearings 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.539
 because the fans that have the 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.539
 brush 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.080
 where the load quality and usually happens 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.340
 this is normal after the only thing that 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520
 we have to do is put the screws 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.410
 and that we are all going to put the current and 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.870
 is for it feels that it rotates enough 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.320
 air and does not make fan noise 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.400
 old or does not lack the oil that is the 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.100
 typical annoying noise now paid her 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.500
 and as we can see it keeps turning around 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.389
 enough time that means you have 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.990
 very good lubrication now we put you 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.990
 the screws 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.169
 and that was it 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.970
 anything do not hesitate to consult me 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.160
