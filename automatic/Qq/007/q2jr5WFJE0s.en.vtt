00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
recommend this wrong over the stock one

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.100 
recommend this wrong over the stock one
just<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.849> know<00:01:54.970> it's<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.509> battery

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
just because you know it's the battery

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.929 
just because you know it's the battery
last<00:01:56.349> longer<00:01:56.590> if<00:01:57.459> you're<00:01:57.610> looking<00:01:57.909> for

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
last longer if you're looking for

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.130 
last longer if you're looking for
something<00:01:58.719> stock<00:01:59.229> but<00:01:59.739> a<00:02:00.009> little<00:02:00.340> bit<00:02:00.459> better

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
something stock but a little bit better

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.809 
something stock but a little bit better
this<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.969> because<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:05.039> we<00:02:06.039> laugh<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.759> much

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
this is it because that we laugh so much

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.080 
this is it because that we laugh so much
longer<00:02:07.890> other<00:02:08.890> than<00:02:09.129> that<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:09.579> pretty<00:02:09.670> much

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
longer other than that it's pretty much

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.449 
longer other than that it's pretty much
stuck<00:02:10.539> i<00:02:10.750> guess<00:02:11.019> but<00:02:11.380> i<00:02:11.440> highly<00:02:11.680> recommend<00:02:12.310> it
