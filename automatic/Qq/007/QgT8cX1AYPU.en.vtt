00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
back of the PCB here it is black as well

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.679 
back of the PCB here it is black as well
as<00:01:24.509> being<00:01:24.780> able<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.090> PCI<00:01:27.090> Express

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
interface as well as the two sli fingers

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
interface as well as the two sli fingers
at<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> top<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
at the top so this way you can do up to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.170 
at the top so this way you can do up to
four-way<00:01:36.960> SLI<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> should<00:01:38.490> choose<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> do

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
four-way SLI if you should choose to do

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.469 
four-way SLI if you should choose to do
so<00:01:39.409> flip<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> top<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so flip it around to the top here you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.280 
so flip it around to the top here you
can<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.399> power<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.329> plugged<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.170> here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
can see the power can be plugged in here

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.690 
can see the power can be plugged in here
you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> 8<00:01:47.070> pin<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.180> 6<00:01:48.689> pin<00:01:48.930> PCI

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
you have the 8 pin and the 6 pin PCI

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
you have the 8 pin and the 6 pin PCI
Express<00:01:50.700> power<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.450> I'll<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.409> flip<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
Express power and I'll just flip that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
Express power and I'll just flip that
around<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.220> show<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.659> front<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.840 
card and we have a dual fan setup with a
massive<00:01:59.969> fin<00:02:00.479> array<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:02.009> believe<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
massive fin array here and I believe it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.639 
massive fin array here and I believe it
is<00:02:03.060> yep<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:04.700> for<00:02:05.960> heat<00:02:06.960> pipes<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
is yep it's for for heat pipes here to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.190 
is yep it's for for heat pipes here to
draw<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.890> heat<00:02:08.220> off<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.940> off<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.840> card

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
draw the heat off of the off of the card

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.360 
draw the heat off of the off of the card
itself<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.310> let<00:02:11.760> me<00:02:11.819> flip<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.209> around

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
itself so let me flip it around

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
itself so let me flip it around
you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.489> see<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> i/o<00:02:14.939> here<00:02:15.689> and<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.349> where

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you can see the i/o here and see where

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500 
you can see the i/o here and see where
the<00:02:16.620> fins<00:02:16.860> would<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.250> actually<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.269> case

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the fins would be actually in this case

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.759 
the fins would be actually in this case
it's<00:02:18.689> gonna<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.959> blowing<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.379> every<00:02:19.620> direction

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
it's gonna be blowing in every direction

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's gonna be blowing in every direction
not<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.700> other<00:02:20.819> versions<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.360> I've

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
not like the other versions that I've

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.929 
not like the other versions that I've
seen<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:22.680> has<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> shroud<00:02:23.340> but

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
seen that actually has the shroud but

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.360 
seen that actually has the shroud but
you<00:02:24.150> notice<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.930> two<00:02:25.170> DVI<00:02:25.680> ports<00:02:26.189> as

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you notice here the two DVI ports as

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.869 
you notice here the two DVI ports as

I'll<00:02:30.780> flip<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.109> back<00:02:31.290> around<00:02:31.439> to<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.829> back

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
I'll flip it back around to the back

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.130 
I'll flip it back around to the back
