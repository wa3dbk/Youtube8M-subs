00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.120
 start off 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:31.160
 the end of the summer for children are all real boys 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.080
 play on pc dressing eyes statistics 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.170
 shows that the average age of the game 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.239
 konsolschika from 20 to 30 years and my 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 observation convinces me of veracity 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.980
 This data is smart people who bought 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 the prefix child suddenly realize that with 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.400
 she doesn’t need to bathe so much she doesn’t 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.470
 no driver installation needed 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.629
 compatibility and other 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.690
 floating bridge that has long been turned off 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.940
 after work before her for many years 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.220

 anything now we'll turn on it yet 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.740
 I have time so it is necessary to eat that interest 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.060
 spend more time with him 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.850
 tends to zero 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 and here children just love to mess with 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.250
 computers download patch restart 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.500
 install upgrade 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.620
 Well, if the truth is to play all sorts of garbage and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.530
 sound so that and console for real 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.730
 Well, yes and that is, I have already passed in mass 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.090
 effect 3 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.750
 I, in principle, also passed but for myself so 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.270
 your too me play piracy not 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.940
 harming the developers some not 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.120
 good boys girls will call 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.490

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.130
 don't want to pay for it let's leave in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520
 Aside from any party sites and we will 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 a hand 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.259
 logically many many feathers do not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.119
 pay for games thereby depriving 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.390
 salary developers 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.399
 him make good games and even 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 opportunities to do it because you need it 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.950
 considerable cache but a feast of swelling love it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 declare what such under- received are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.650
 would know nothing who keratitis so not 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.750
 wants and will not pay for any 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.489
 I wouldn't flesh even if 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.129
 the pirate will completely disappear 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.470
 play 1 st she sings bam so we 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.269
 we don’t take anything away from pirates 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.880
 would still not buy this garbage 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.099
 bulk torrent voro capable 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.620
 pay at least two three games a year 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.319
 well, maybe even more and even more so 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.049
 wo n't give it up completely 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.970
 easy to see on sales of pc games 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.769
 most expense with such miserable 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.530
 circulations that you might think 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.720
 ori pe pk geyma but that's how it is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.329
 comes in about projects and the main role 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.090
 plays multiplayer for example black ops 2 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.459
 then sales immediately go on record 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 figure suggests the idea that pirates 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.230
 woke up conscience alas it can 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.630
 explain that multiplayer requires 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.319
 online that with a pirate so easy not 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.720
 will let 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.000
 and here are our gangsters of the global network 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.030
 asking parents for license money 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.459
 hence the simple and sad conclusion of many 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.200
 lovers of freebies can pay and are ready 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.389
 pay in principle which means 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.180
 developers should think about doing 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.549
 more interesting multiplayer or we can 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.989
 remember skyrim although it is already quite 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.970
 another story with you was bass tornau 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.140
