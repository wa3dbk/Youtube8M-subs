00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.309
 we 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.049
 dear listeners of the passion of 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.539
 reptiles the first online radio of 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.240
 all French terrariophiles we 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.090
 are still on the arras stock market and 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.439
 we are now with karim daoues 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.169
 hello karim 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.619
 hello then tell me a karim it's a 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.050
 little your baby here in my baby not this 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.810
 scholarship was initiated by a band of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.500
 field over amateurs under a formula 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.450
 associative 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.860
 I gave it a different dimension 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.110
 this professional dimension 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.690
 today with exhibitors coming from 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.150
 all over Europe with 145 exhibitors on 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.770
 4000 square meters so I contributed 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.850
 actually to be largely evolved to 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.770
 professionalize this blunder so 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.710
 it's not my baby but I adopted them 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.510
 with pleasure and how it was 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.020
 passed today 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.690
 today is a busy day 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.060
 quite complicated but without any glitches 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.220
 major in the sense that the visitors 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.130
 alas the exhibitors are satisfied and 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 so we leave again for scholarship 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 next year on June 23 and the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 tonal elderberry is not decided yet 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.490
 but on the same time slots 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.980
 why this choice of arras arras actually 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.450
 is a city that is easy enough 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.060
 access when coming from the north of 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.040
 europe which is relatively close to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.780
 paris the city of arras that we 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.370
 welcomes with pleasure in this hall 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.200
 of exposure that very comfortable and 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.150
 very handy for giving a dimension 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.130
 professional so the choice of arras 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.720
 is an economical choice 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.640
 a heart choice in quotation marks 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.920
 since the history of this scholarship is 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.780
 in any case related to northern cities not 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.979
 necessarily arras as such but he 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.570
 was pretty hard to find in 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.630
 Paris area something from 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.090
 comparable so reptiles exposed this framework 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 once again arras for visions 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 to come a lot a lot of passage on 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 the stand of the tropical farm we could 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.219
 note 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.649
 what has worked best 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.659
 today is it the council 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.149
 is it selling equipment 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.060
 is it the sale of reptiles or 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.129
 are these same information at the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.569
 about the formations you give 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.950
 what has worked best 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.140
 today his job since I 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.050
 spent my time liaising with 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.690
 the different stands so everyone is in 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.580
 charge of a cluster of activities has gone wrong 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.860
 of olive marquis time for 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.569
 formations whatever the center team 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.549
 acclimatization that was present for 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.879
 these days where the sales teams of 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.290
 Paris 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.780
 the lille store was also 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.940
 represented so all the teams 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.489
 of the tropical farm was on the foot 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.140
 of war today to contribute to 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.110
 this success since today we had a 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.049
 visitor provided a nice weather thank you 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.239
 and that he always goes 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.660
 passionate TV movies at the rendezvous is 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.760
 what we have an idea of ​​the number of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.950
 visitors who were still 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.299
 grandiose I can not at the moment 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.640
 you give a name because he could 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.829
 actually look at accounts and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200
 all this if we talk 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.870
 how many people have passed the door 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.799
 of artois expo today between four 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.579
 and five thousand huge it's a weapon and 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.440
 did you have any echoes so 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.180
 your feet worked a lot so 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.340
 in the aisles is what you 're going 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.940
 heard some remarks from the enthusiasm 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.400
 people to visitors returns 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.709
 so visitors yes there are often 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.720
 people who come to discuss a small 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.190
 little give them give them their 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.510
 feeling about the organization of the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.859
 stuff on the job that we can 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.430
 to do around that it's always 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.579
 rewarding 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.040
 so yes rather rather visitors 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.880
 satisfied since in fact this scholarship 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.139
 is in perpetual growth so 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.150
 exhibitors but in 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.200
 steady growth also on the 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.299
 number of entries since we had 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.099
 makes fewer entries on the stock market 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.560
 previous in the fall so a 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.460
 steady evolution of a rate of 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.650
 important satisfaction of the 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.510
 realization that I hope to be the most 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.420
 possible professional that allowed to 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.060
 give this dimension to the exhibition 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.090
 perfect is it that since our last 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.320
 meet on the stock exchange of the fft tutu and 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.239
 had echoes from the radio and and from 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.840
 the interview we had done together 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.750
 so that may seem far the last 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.520
 manifestation of the ftg not unemployed since 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.190
 and so I absolutely did not have the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 time to inquire about how this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.300
 who was going to see 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.800
 and I admit that even if I support to 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 background the idea I have not had time yet 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.820
 from the experienced in a very personal capacity 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.340
 well I think you'll have a very 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.410
 good surprise when you consider the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.410
