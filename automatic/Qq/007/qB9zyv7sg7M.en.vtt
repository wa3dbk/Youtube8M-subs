00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
able to capture there before the the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
able to capture there before the the

better<00:01:00.390> than<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:01.140> reviews<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
better than my first reviews of the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
better than my first reviews of the
pictures<00:01:02.100> i<00:01:02.280> thought<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.359> actual<00:01:04.170> DVD

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
pictures i thought that the actual DVD

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
pictures i thought that the actual DVD
covers<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.189> blu-ray<00:01:05.460> covers<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.909> year<00:01:06.180> a

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.610 
that's why i started picking these up i
thought<00:05:34.390> this<00:05:34.540> first<00:05:34.840> year<00:05:35.110> that<00:05:35.140> something

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
thought this first year that something

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.900 
thought this first year that something
would<00:05:35.710> slip<00:05:35.950> through<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.250> cracks<00:05:36.280> with<00:05:36.700> the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
would slip through the cracks with the

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.630 
would slip through the cracks with the
best<00:05:37.090> buy<00:05:37.270> exclusives<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.260> but<00:05:38.500> hey<00:05:39.430> just
