00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
5 6 7 8 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 ok so that's this

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.020 
5 6 7 8 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 ok so that's this
how<00:03:00.319> touch<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.579> what<00:03:01.700> I'm<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:01.879> be

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
how touch and that's what I'm gonna be

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.680 
how touch and that's what I'm gonna be
teaching<00:03:02.180> you

teaching you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.129 
teaching you
okay<00:03:03.109> so<00:03:03.170> first<00:03:04.659> the<00:03:05.659> hook<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:05.989> would

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
okay so first the hook when I would

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.379 
okay so first the hook when I would
touch<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:07.159> just<00:03:07.250> jumping<00:03:07.909> up<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.150> basically

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
touch is just jumping up and basically

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.449 
touch is just jumping up and basically
going<00:03:08.810> into<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.200> splint<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:09.980> except<00:03:10.310> your

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
going into a splint kind of except your

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.979 
going into a splint kind of except your
feet<00:03:10.639> are<00:03:10.849> still<00:03:11.150> kind<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.629> front<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> you

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
feet are still kind of in front of you

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.830 
feet are still kind of in front of you
so<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.349> more<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.709> straddle<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.840> you're

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
so it's more like a straddle and you're

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.990 
so it's more like a straddle and you're
gonna<00:03:14.959> try<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.530> bring<00:03:16.159> your<00:03:16.280> legs<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.849> your

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
gonna try and bring your legs to your

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.530 
gonna try and bring your legs to your
arms<00:03:17.419> so<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:19.220> want<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.579> make<00:03:19.910> sure<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.299> point

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
arms so you want to make sure you point

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.869 
arms so you want to make sure you point
your<00:03:20.690> toes<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.199> you<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.560> by<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.680> way<00:03:21.879> okay

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
your toes when you do it by the way okay

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.039 
your toes when you do it by the way okay
so<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.150> counts<00:03:23.449> are<00:03:23.540> pretty<00:03:23.690> much<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.930> same

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
so the counts are pretty much the same

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.020 
so the counts are pretty much the same
for<00:03:24.199> a<00:03:24.260> toe<00:03:24.379> touch<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.370> you're<00:03:25.519> gonna<00:03:25.609> go<00:03:25.819> down

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
for a toe touch so you're gonna go down

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.009 
for a toe touch so you're gonna go down
one<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:27.949> you<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.160> up<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.669> two<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.299> then

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
one and then you go up on two and then

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.289 
one and then you go up on two and then
this<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.379> different<00:03:30.799> because<00:03:31.010> then<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.120> Pike

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
this is different because then it Pike

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.229 
this is different because then it Pike
because<00:03:32.810> you're<00:03:33.470> gonna<00:03:33.560> cross<00:03:34.250> your<00:03:34.579> arms<00:03:35.000> as

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
because you're gonna cross your arms as

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.449 
because you're gonna cross your arms as
you're<00:03:35.359> bending<00:03:35.629> your<00:03:35.750> knees<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.500> then

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
you're bending your knees and then

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.520 
you're bending your knees and then
you're<00:03:37.730> gonna<00:03:37.849> go<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.660> into<00:03:38.840> your<00:03:38.959> toe<00:03:39.230> touch

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
you're gonna go up into your toe touch

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.189 
you're gonna go up into your toe touch
like<00:03:39.799> that<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.569> then<00:03:41.569> you're<00:03:41.720> gonna<00:03:41.810> come

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
like that and then you're gonna come

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.270 
like that and then you're gonna come
down<00:03:42.910> five<00:03:43.910> six<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.629> then<00:03:44.989> pop<00:03:45.440> up<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.949> seven

eight<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.389> slowly<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.590> would<00:03:48.739> be<00:03:48.889> like<00:03:49.870> one<00:03:51.250> two

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
eight so slowly it would be like one two

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:00.149 
eight so slowly it would be like one two
three<00:03:54.169> and<00:03:54.470> four<00:03:55.209> five<00:03:56.209> six<00:03:57.340> seven<00:03:58.340> eight<00:03:58.930> so
