 back of the car 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.340
 left such antennas here again 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 hieroglyphs in general turned out very 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330
 not bad 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 so would also put a led 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.560
 I will try the backlight now 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.759
 show now not much 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.060
 dark and therefore not visible will not be so 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:56.170
 Here I have a very highlight LED 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:04.300
 looks beautiful especially at night as 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:10.320
 flying saucer look at my salon here 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 It looks like salon colic capes 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:21.930
 winding on the steering wheel so that's my pen on 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:27.780

 cassette speaker so here it looks 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.970
 elephant from behind 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:53.549
 Now Iâ€™ll dwell a little more on 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:57.840
 The radio tape recorder I will share my experience means 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:02.069
 when i bought the car went to the store for 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.889
 tape recorder did not say advised 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.930
 the seller take 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:12.510
 tape recorder good two speakers in the door 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.099
 my question is why why only two 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.200
 dynamics is not 4 he said that in tune 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.560
 Grant rear shelf speakers not 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.980
 crash put a subwoofer take 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.489
 the trunk is running this enough I am with him 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.569
 did not argue 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:42.469
 took the pioneer tape recorder to 14:50 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.469
 speakers pioneer example a 16 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.450
 and subwoofer ngn 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:54.680
 arrived at the auto show days service 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:59.110
 auto service at the auto show gave all one hundred 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.260
 bought an electrician and asked if it was true 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.710
 the speakers do not put the rear shelf on what 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:11.540
 he said yes to me in the trunk will not 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:16.400
 close and the like train 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:21.050
 somewhere a couple of months, I realized that the sound 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.350
 not loud enough clean without thinking twice 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 with a friend using a grinder 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 neatly cut holes which 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:40.180
 consequences stopped the dynamics like this 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.930
 Here is all I have now 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:53.170
 speakers the fifth element is quite neat 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:53.170
 laid down here is not such a hand machine now 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:41.420
 which is in my car now 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.260
 but believe it is powerful enough 4 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.070
 dynamics and subwoofer make themselves known 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:52.630
 Now I will show you how the dynamics 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.630
 look from the trunk 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.430
 it turned out certainly not very neat 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.730
 in tone 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:12.920
 steel and do not interfere with such one here 1. 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.920
 embed 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:26.139
 That's what my trunk looks like right now 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:26.139
 two speakers and a subwoofer 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:47.349
 it all cost me not expensive 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:51.220
 this sound has become pure powerful good bass 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.220
 it became more pleasant to drive 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.510
 I hope my video 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:31.280
 someone will help someone take that 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:38.340
 then for yourself and when you buy frets grants 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:42.260
 well and decorate dress up buy 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.270
 set a good sound 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.810
 trim the speakers back shelf nothing 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.810
 scary 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.970
 I apologize for my lack of professionalism 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:05.139
 terms of shooting and communication but it turned out like 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.139
 so thank you everyone meeting
