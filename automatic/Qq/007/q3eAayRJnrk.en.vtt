all fantastic art attacks and you know
what<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.350> design<00:00:07.620> drawing<00:00:08.400> around<00:00:08.460> secular

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
what that design drawing around secular

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.509 
what that design drawing around secular
objects<00:00:09.630> has<00:00:10.050> given<00:00:10.349> me<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.590> fantastic<00:00:11.370> idea

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
objects has given me a fantastic idea

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.870 
objects has given me a fantastic idea
you<00:00:12.240> need<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.630> large<00:00:13.110> round<00:00:13.559> tray<00:00:14.070> or<00:00:14.340> place<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
you need a large round tray or place and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.480 
you need a large round tray or place and
just<00:00:15.179> place<00:00:15.420> part<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> just<00:00:16.980> over<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> edge

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
just place part of it just over the edge

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.019 
just place part of it just over the edge
and<00:00:17.970> then<00:00:18.330> draw<00:00:18.900> around<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and then draw around it like that so you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.330 
and then draw around it like that so you
get<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.300> smooth<00:00:21.720> curve<00:00:22.140> nice<00:00:22.800> smooth<00:00:23.070> care

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
get this smooth curve nice smooth care

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.160 
get this smooth curve nice smooth care
and<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.060> place<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> tray<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and then just place the tray on the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.529 
and then just place the tray on the
left-hand<00:00:25.560> edge<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.430> again<00:00:26.910> draw

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
left-hand edge like that and again draw

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.109 
left-hand edge like that and again draw
a<00:00:27.840> curve<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.010> touching<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.699> first

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
a curve so that it's touching the first

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.139 
a curve so that it's touching the first
curve<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.520> place<00:00:32.759> your<00:00:32.790> tray

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
curve like that and then place your tray

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.350 
curve like that and then place your tray
up<00:00:33.390> there<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> again<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.700> with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
up there like that and again there with

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350 
up there like that and again there with
another<00:00:37.350> curved<00:00:37.680> line<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.700> bet<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> can't

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
another curved line and I bet you can't

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.580 
another curved line and I bet you can't
guess<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.750> gonna<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.079> next

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
guess what I'm gonna do next

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
guess what I'm gonna do next
join<00:00:40.950> those<00:00:41.190> lines<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.879> yet<00:00:42.180> another<00:00:42.390> line

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
join those lines with yet another line

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.369 
join those lines with yet another line
gets<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.280> smaller<00:00:44.789> circle<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.510> maybe<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
gets a smaller circle this time maybe a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
gets a smaller circle this time maybe a
smaller<00:00:46.770> plate<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:48.090> place<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.570> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
smaller plate and just place that's like

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.990 
smaller plate and just place that's like
that<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> same<00:00:50.010> again<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
that and do the same again in there and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.709 
that and do the same again in there and
like<00:00:54.739> that's<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> idea<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> cut<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.539> out

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
like that's the idea is to cut that out

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.060 
like that's the idea is to cut that out
and<00:00:58.309> that's<00:00:59.309> house<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
and that's house so that you have a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
and that's house so that you have a
funky<00:01:02.070> shape<00:01:02.719> now<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.260> more

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
funky shape now to make it even more

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.320 
funky shape now to make it even more
funky<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.700> ham<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
funky you need to go ham it up in a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.410 
funky you need to go ham it up in a
really<00:01:06.510> garish<00:01:07.140> groovy<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.250> use<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> pencil

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
really garish groovy way so use a pencil

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
really garish groovy way so use a pencil
to<00:01:09.840> draw<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.439> wacky<00:01:11.130> waving<00:01:11.369> design<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to draw on a wacky waving design you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
to draw on a wacky waving design you
don't<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> neat<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.930> anything<00:01:13.229> just
