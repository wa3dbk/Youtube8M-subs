00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 Hello, everyone, doom. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.400
 finally got me another 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.920
 release 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.570
 marvolo shot collection 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:31.579
 this time we have the 6th edition of wolverine 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 previous release we had Spiderman 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.770
 the birth of venoma and actually already like 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.360
 notable changes from wolverine yes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.710
 there is no sort of cardboard cover of this 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.719
 sleeves up to which is attached 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.449
 protected from damage just like that 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.649
 comic itself sealed in this flew 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.120
 on glue to number six no announcements 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 nothing and as if there is no inscription there 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.920
 recommended price there is 299 rubles then 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
 there are now manufacturers can more accurately 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 manufacturer sellers make a surcharge 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 even more already in some years 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.420
 cities so do up raise the price 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.650
 but I bought for the same price which 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.150
 previous issues 380 rubles 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.680
 somewhere in Moscow St. Petersburg there 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.790
 other cities and sell by 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 recommended price but I took for 380 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.939
 what is the most striking date 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.409
 this is the thickness of the comic it is very thin 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 however many there complain 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.780
 why the cost is the same comic tanks 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 the answer is simple 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.579
 because there are only four wolverines 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.500
 release that is more here it is impossible 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.729
 to fit 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.259
 so he is such a tonic yes compared 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.990
 with spiderman 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.899
 almost like giving like two wolverines 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.350
 spiderman 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.350
 oh well 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.650
 let's watch at once 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.079
 waited there for a long time 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.459
 comics marvel miracles then there 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.189
 next year hulk captain america 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.189
 winter salad soldier part 2 for some reason 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.189
 for some reason I don't know no 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.540
 I do not know why we all like but people 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.319

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:51.049
 nothing is clear well there is here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 small so small 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:03:03.349
 Here it can be seen here until sundress or something not 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:08.150
 knew it pasted that oh well it 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:11.469
 not very noticeably need it like that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.180
 from glue 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:19.760
 Okay , you can still tint 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 we actually have such a comic that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:31.729
 let's immediately open let's see so here 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:36.560
 we already have a log wolverine with a crossbow like 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:38.889
 always light your cigar well y 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.699
 have we changed interesting 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:47.269
 circulation of 32 thousand copies 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:50.209
 again mark the magnifier story 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.750
 trample this release 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.110
 I will close here, we are here 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.860
 classic 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.590
 Oh my God there neighbors begin to change the seam 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.450
 drill from you on 1 hear God how 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.630
 always at the wrong time when you start something 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.030
 shoot as it starts to drill and here 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 actually we have the first such cover 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.700
 wolverine number one marvel comics 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.980
 limited series 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.480
 such the most classic miranda 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.820
 wolverine is not the one we have in 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.720
 animated series 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.240
 but again it is made in the style 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.770
 spiderman because such from 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.770
 eighties comics 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.919
 impart youth classics to see 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:51.590
 equally the panache man that spider 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:54.450
 that wolverine has its own plot 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.990
 This comic is about how we 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:01.320
 logan goes to Japan to search 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.550
 to my beloved orico it is like 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.650
 repeats the plot of the movie wolverine 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.000
 the immortal who we got out of it 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.890
 in the summer, more precisely last summer, comics with 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.560
 thin it will probably be 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:23.950
 read in one go well 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.450
 in general, I waited happily to read it 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:32.380
 I do not know there are some here complain 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.200
 that he is so thin yes the price should 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.010
 be less sell for the same but 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.510
 as far as I know in the next releases not 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.790
 there will be these more subtle comics will 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.310
 all almost the same thickness but somewhere 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.480
 there I do not remember in what exactly comic 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:56.500
 There will be a thick book in general 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.080
 let's hope why such a handbag 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.070
 someone like it and here by the way u 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:08.610
 us and wolverine costumes are the most 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.610
 The first costume is generally not very 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:19.330
 seventy-fifth year the seventh year here 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:26.130
 so we have such more but here 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:29.470
 actually classic already wolverines hulk 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.460
 I always like to marvel give 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:37.600
 additional materials so to speak 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:43.360
 again the singles ad 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:48.510
 Russian is not bad, we read well 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:53.080
 We'll see, but I think I will like it. 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:56.050
 we are waiting actually when can I 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.030
