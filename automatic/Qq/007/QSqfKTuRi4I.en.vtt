00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
lens so let's start with the two big s

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.009 
lens so let's start with the two big s
expensive<00:00:22.080> lenses<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.340> 500<00:00:24.240> f/4<00:00:24.779> let

expensive lenses we have a 500 f/4 let

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
expensive lenses we have a 500 f/4 let
me<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:26.070> called<00:00:26.310> an<00:00:26.430> F<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:26.699> e

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
me get this right they called an F for e

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.849 
me get this right they called an F for e
the<00:00:27.900> e<00:00:27.930> stands<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.890> electromagnetic

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the e stands for electromagnetic

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.830 
the e stands for electromagnetic
diaphragm<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.250> means<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.210> diaphragm

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
diaphragm that means it's a diaphragm

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
diaphragm that means it's a diaphragm
that's<00:00:34.079> electromagnetic<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.520> said

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that's electromagnetic just like I said

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.569 
that's electromagnetic just like I said
it's<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.180> F<00:00:36.360> LED<00:00:37.200> VR<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> F<00:00:37.920> L<00:00:38.129> stands<00:00:38.430> for

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it's an F LED VR the F L stands for

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's an F LED VR the F L stands for
fluoride<00:00:39.149> lenses<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.200> fluorite<00:00:40.620> lenses<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
fluoride lenses or fluorite lenses you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.650 
fluoride lenses or fluorite lenses you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and everything along those lines so

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.190 
and everything along those lines so
basically<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> 500<00:00:47.789> F<00:00:47.940> 4<00:00:48.270> E<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
basically you have the 500 F 4 E and a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.450 
basically you have the 500 F 4 E and a
600<00:00:49.860> f4<00:00:50.730> e<00:00:51.000> faster<00:00:51.930> AF<00:00:52.460> electromagnetic

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
600 f4 e faster AF electromagnetic

600 f4 e faster AF electromagnetic
diaphragms<00:00:54.059> other<00:00:54.360> than<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
diaphragms other than that it's the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.240 
diaphragms other than that it's the
weight<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> difference<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.559> 500

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
weight that is the difference so the 500

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.650 
weight that is the difference so the 500

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to be really good for video because it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
to be really good for video because it
the<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.220> electromagnetic<00:02:08.729> diaphragm<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the the electromagnetic diaphragm is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350 
the the electromagnetic diaphragm is
supposed<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.410> better<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.979> exposure<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
supposed to be better for exposure and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.650 
supposed to be better for exposure and
all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
all

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.330

there's good stuff and that's what that
type<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> lens<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.630> VR<00:02:16.020> yeah<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> mean

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
type of lens is for the VR yeah I mean

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620 
type of lens is for the VR yeah I mean
hand-holding<00:02:17.760> you're<00:02:17.940> never<00:02:18.060> gonna<00:02:18.180> handhold

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
hand-holding you're never gonna handhold

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.850 
hand-holding you're never gonna handhold
something<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.200> unless<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.470> got<00:02:19.590> guns

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
something like that unless you got guns

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.570 
something like that unless you got guns
like<00:02:20.100> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
like this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.580 
like this
I<00:02:20.610> couldn't<00:02:21.390> even<00:02:21.450> handhold<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.110> well<00:02:22.350> maybe

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
I couldn't even handhold that well maybe

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.900 
I couldn't even handhold that well maybe
I<00:02:22.710> could<00:02:22.830> at<00:02:23.100> 8<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> half<00:02:23.430> pounds<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:23.850> that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I could at 8 and a half pounds but that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.760 
I could at 8 and a half pounds but that
would<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.210> hard<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> handhold<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.590> are

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
would be hard to handhold but these are

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.650 
would be hard to handhold but these are
massive<00:02:26.010> lenses<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.910> most<00:02:27.180> people<00:02:27.510> aren't

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
massive lenses that most people aren't

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.840 
massive lenses that most people aren't
gonna<00:02:27.840> buy<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.680> what<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
gonna buy and so what we have is the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.510 
gonna buy and so what we have is the
next<00:02:30.150> lens<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.780> 16<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> 80<00:02:31.880> 2.8<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.660> f/4<00:02:34.520> vrn

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
next lens it's a 16 to 80 2.8 to f/4 vrn

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.060 
next lens it's a 16 to 80 2.8 to f/4 vrn
meaning<00:02:35.970> nano-coating<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.140> DX<00:02:37.710> lens

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
meaning nano-coating but it's a DX lens

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.890 
meaning nano-coating but it's a DX lens
meaning<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.550> designed<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.660> crop

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
meaning it's designed for the crop

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.380 
meaning it's designed for the crop
sensor<00:02:40.290> cameras<00:02:40.710> now<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> 16<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.550> 80<00:02:41.730> millimeter

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.440 
sensor cameras now a 16 to 80 millimeter
lens<00:02:42.660> gives<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> range<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> 24<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.760> 120

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
lens gives you the range of a 24 to 120

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.810 
lens gives you the range of a 24 to 120
which<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.990> lot<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.320> people<00:02:46.590> love<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.580> full

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
frame side that's an f4 straight through

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.510 
frame side that's an f4 straight through
this<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> 2.8<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.020> 4<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.470> don't<00:02:52.800> know<00:02:52.920> where<00:02:53.250> it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
this is a 2.8 to 4 I don't know where it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.180 
this is a 2.8 to 4 I don't know where it
turns<00:02:53.850> from<00:02:54.060> 2.8<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> 3.2<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.740> gets<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.070> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
turns from 2.8 to 3.2 and gets all the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.930 
turns from 2.8 to 3.2 and gets all the
way<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> 4<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.290> nice<00:02:58.560> range<00:02:59.190> having

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
way to 4 but it's a nice range having

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.610 
way to 4 but it's a nice range having
the<00:03:00.060> VR<00:03:00.390> means<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.170> good<00:03:01.320> for

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the VR means it's going to be good for

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.740 
the VR means it's going to be good for
video<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.180> take<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.510> into

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
video because we have to take that into

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.150 
video because we have to take that into
consideration<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> thing<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.100> don't

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
consideration but the thing I don't

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.700 
consideration but the thing I don't
understand<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.570> price<00:03:08.210> 1060<00:03:09.210> 995<00:03:10.020> not

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
understand is the price 1060 995 not

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.530 
understand is the price 1060 995 not
many<00:03:11.010> people<00:03:11.280> are<00:03:11.520> gonna<00:03:11.730> spend<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.270> money<00:03:12.450> on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
many people are gonna spend the money on

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.300 
many people are gonna spend the money on
DX<00:03:13.170> lenses<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.830> my<00:03:13.860> opinion<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:16.440> DX<00:03:16.680> lenses<00:03:17.070> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
DX lenses in my opinion for DX lenses I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.210 
DX lenses in my opinion for DX lenses I
mean<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> lot<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.110> money<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.680> hard<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
mean that's a lot of money it's hard to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220 
mean that's a lot of money it's hard to
get<00:03:20.370> people<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.730> understand<00:03:21.570> when<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.959> buy<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
get people to understand when they buy a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.410 
get people to understand when they buy a
DX<00:03:22.800> body<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> D<00:03:23.910> 3300<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.810> D<00:03:24.990> 5,500<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.040> D<00:03:26.420> 7200

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
DX body like a D 3300 a D 5,500 a D 7200

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.970 
DX body like a D 3300 a D 5,500 a D 7200
that<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.900> should<00:03:28.080> spend<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.440> lot<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.770> money

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
that you should spend a lot of money
