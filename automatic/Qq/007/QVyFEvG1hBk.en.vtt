same time when it comes to putting
together<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.520> look<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.030> find<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:39.570> always

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
together a look I find that I'm always

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.480 
together a look I find that I'm always
going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> same<00:03:40.560> color<00:03:40.830> for<00:03:41.040> my<00:03:41.190> crease

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
going to the same color for my crease

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.060 
going to the same color for my crease
and<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.000> busted<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.860> where<00:03:44.040> I

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
and that is busted here now is where I

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.320 
and that is busted here now is where I
want<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.280> bring<00:03:44.460> in<00:03:44.610> sort<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.090> little

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
want to bring in sort of a little

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.900 
want to bring in sort of a little
comparison<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.530> when<00:03:46.710> you<00:03:46.800> look<00:03:47.010> at<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
comparison because when you look at the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.150 
comparison because when you look at the
naked<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.050> guess<00:03:49.530> we'll<00:03:49.740> call<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.040> which

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
naked one I guess we'll call it which

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
naked one I guess we'll call it which
came<00:03:50.340> with<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.610> double<00:03:50.940> ended<00:03:51.210> liner<00:03:51.450> here

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
came with that double ended liner here

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.490 
came with that double ended liner here
you<00:03:52.710> can<00:03:52.860> see<00:03:53.130> you've<00:03:53.820> got<00:03:53.850> actually<00:03:54.500> several

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
you can see you've got actually several

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.520 
you can see you've got actually several
deep<00:03:55.920> dark<00:03:56.280> shades<00:03:56.670> you've<00:03:57.270> got<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.990> your<00:03:58.230> kind

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
deep dark shades you've got in your kind

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.100 
deep dark shades you've got in your kind
of<00:03:58.590> black<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:58.950> slightly<00:03:59.910> navy<00:04:00.360> blue<00:04:00.750> tones

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
of black and slightly navy blue tones

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
of black and slightly navy blue tones
you've<00:04:01.410> got<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> plum<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.280> got<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.490> dark<00:04:02.790> brown

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
you've got a plum you got a dark brown

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.590 
you've got a plum you got a dark brown
so<00:04:03.660> you've<00:04:04.260> basically<00:04:04.530> got<00:04:05.070> three<00:04:05.850> different

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
so you've basically got three different

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.870 
so you've basically got three different
segments<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.680> smokey<00:04:08.190> eye<00:04:08.220> looks<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.760> could

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
segments of smokey eye looks you could

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760 
segments of smokey eye looks you could
come<00:04:09.060> up<00:04:09.210> with<00:04:09.390> now<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:10.080> called<00:04:10.320> The<00:04:10.560> Naked

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
come up with now it's called The Naked

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.350 
come up with now it's called The Naked
palette<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.550> called<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.940> smokey

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
palette it's not called the smokey

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.910 
palette it's not called the smokey
palette<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.290> purpose<00:04:13.740> may

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
palette so I get that the purpose may

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.830 
palette so I get that the purpose may
not<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.580> get<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.940> deepest<00:04:15.330> there<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.720> went

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
not be to get the deepest there it went

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.630 
not be to get the deepest there it went

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
on the floor we'll see if it survived in

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.330
