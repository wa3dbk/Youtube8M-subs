hey<00:00:03.480> folks<00:00:03.780> day<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.080> wanted<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.440> revisit<00:00:04.620> on<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
hey folks day I wanted to revisit on a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.629 
hey folks day I wanted to revisit on a
slider<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.730> I'd<00:00:06.000> meet<00:00:06.210> previously<00:00:07.460> this<00:00:08.460> one

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
slider that I'd meet previously this one

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.589 
slider that I'd meet previously this one
here<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.559> different<00:00:11.480> little<00:00:12.480> bit

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
here is a different little bit

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.539 
here is a different little bit
difference<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> same<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.250> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
difference about the same but I just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.890 
difference about the same but I just
wanted<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> explain<00:00:15.269> more<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:15.719> these<00:00:15.870> things

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
wanted to explain more how these things

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.200 
wanted to explain more how these things
go<00:00:16.260> together<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.250> little<00:00:17.580> simpler<00:00:18.000> for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
go together so it's a little simpler for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.130 
go together so it's a little simpler for
you<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.449> you're<00:00:18.570> trying<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> build<00:00:19.050> these

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you when you're trying to build these

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.650 
you when you're trying to build these
things<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.880> wanted<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> show<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
things and I wanted to show you how you

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.939 
things and I wanted to show you how you
can<00:00:22.730> make<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.920> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
can make them this here and see this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.830 
can make them this here and see this
screen<00:00:26.400> being<00:00:26.609> mounted<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> bottom<00:00:27.689> where

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
screen being mounted on the bottom where

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.580 
screen being mounted on the bottom where
it<00:00:27.869> creates<00:00:28.529> friction<00:00:30.140> there's<00:00:31.140> actually

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it creates friction there's actually

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
it creates friction there's actually
what<00:00:31.830> i<00:00:31.859> did<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> put<00:00:32.850> plywood<00:00:33.390> on

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
what i did on here is I put plywood on

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.400 
what i did on here is I put plywood on
the<00:00:33.840> bottom<00:00:34.760> that<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.969> screen<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:37.050> above

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410

as<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:39.770> this<00:00:40.770> plywood<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.520> what's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
as you can see this plywood is what's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
as you can see this plywood is what's
rubbing<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:44.899> works<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
rubbing and works pretty good for this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.930 
rubbing and works pretty good for this
thing<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> didn't<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
all these exact same I can build a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
all these exact same I can build a
quarter<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> half<00:01:08.340> inch<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
quarter and a half inch and you can just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
quarter and a half inch and you can just
rotate<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.380> part<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> rest<00:01:11.610> stays

the same but anyway that's the box and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
the same but anyway that's the box and
this<00:01:17.610> would<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.900> made<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> box<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:24.500> 1<00:01:25.500> by

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this would I made the box out of is 1 by

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.990 
this would I made the box out of is 1 by
3<00:01:28.729> give<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.909> homework<00:01:30.060> 1<00:01:30.630> by<00:01:30.750> 4<00:01:30.960> excuse<00:01:31.259> me

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
3 give them homework 1 by 4 excuse me

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.350 
3 give them homework 1 by 4 excuse me
and<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> box<00:01:34.549> as<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.180> just

and that's the box as you can see i just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.039 
and that's the box as you can see i just
use<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:37.610> staple<00:01:38.610> gun<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
use a little staple gun to put it in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.010 
use a little staple gun to put it in
there<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:43.759> screens<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> leave

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a little belly in the bottom like I got

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.080 
a little belly in the bottom like I got
here<00:01:47.869> all<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.200> bc<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:50.340> tend<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> go

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here all that bc will tend to want to go

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
here all that bc will tend to want to go
up<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.630> sit<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> bellies<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
up in here and sit the bellies up you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.460 
up in here and sit the bellies up you
know<00:01:53.939> hanging<00:01:54.119> toward<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> outside<00:01:54.540> edges<00:01:54.960> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
know hanging toward the outside edges so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.819 
know hanging toward the outside edges so
you<00:01:55.619> gotta<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> real<00:01:57.000> tight<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.829> works

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you gotta go put it real tight but works

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.760 
you gotta go put it real tight but works
real<00:01:59.070> good

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
real good

box of slides sideways I didn't actually

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.810 
box of slides sideways I didn't actually
put<00:02:16.140> stops<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> put<00:02:17.550> a
