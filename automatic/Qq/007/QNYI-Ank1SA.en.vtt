is the model that you're seeing on the
screen<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.130> anyway<00:01:11.909> both<00:01:12.090> models<00:01:12.570> have

a resolution of 1280 by 720 which is HD

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.950 
a resolution of 1280 by 720 which is HD
so<00:01:16.380> unfortunately<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.119> full<00:01:18.689> eighty

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so unfortunately it is not full eighty

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.399 
so unfortunately it is not full eighty
like<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> galaxy<00:01:20.070> s4<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.930> translates

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
like the galaxy s4 and this translates

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.609 
like the galaxy s4 and this translates
to<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> PPI<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.479> 223<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> quite<00:01:25.590> good

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to a PPI of 223 which is quite good

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.640 
to a PPI of 223 which is quite good
judging<00:01:26.430> judging<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.630> its<00:01:27.869> huge<00:01:28.020> screen<00:01:28.439> size

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
judging judging by its huge screen size

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
judging judging by its huge screen size
but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.960> galaxy<00:01:31.409> s4

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but it is not as good as the galaxy s4

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.350 
but it is not as good as the galaxy s4
which<00:01:32.310> has<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.790> ppi<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:34.009> 441<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> totally

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
which has a ppi of 441 which is totally

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
which has a ppi of 441 which is totally
insane<00:01:36.540> anyway<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.759> full

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
taking this comparison even further you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
taking this comparison even further you
can<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.409> how<00:02:04.770> small<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> HTC<00:02:05.850> One<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.270> when

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
can see how small the HTC One is when

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
can see how small the HTC One is when
compared<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> Samsung<00:02:07.350> Galaxy<00:02:07.829> mega<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
compared to the Samsung Galaxy mega and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
compared to the Samsung Galaxy mega and
same<00:02:08.819> goes<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> iPhone<00:02:09.690> 5<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
same goes with the iPhone 5 which is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
same goes with the iPhone 5 which is
even<00:02:10.470> smaller<00:02:10.739> than<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.520> HTC<00:02:11.730> One<00:02:12.390> not<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
even smaller than the HTC One not to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
even smaller than the HTC One not to
mention<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> iPhone<00:02:13.290> 4s<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
mention the iPhone 4s and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
mention the iPhone 4s and
previous<00:02:14.250> iPhone<00:02:14.520> models<00:02:14.880> which<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.360> even

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
previous iPhone models which are even

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
previous iPhone models which are even
smaller<00:02:15.870> than<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> iPhone<00:02:16.620> 5<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> iPhone

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
smaller than the iPhone 5 so the iPhone

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.250 
smaller than the iPhone 5 so the iPhone
basically<00:02:17.760> looks<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.090> an<00:02:18.360> ant<00:02:18.630> when

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
basically looks like an ant when

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
basically looks like an ant when
compared<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.370> Galaxy<00:02:20.880> mega<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.300> same

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
compared to the Galaxy mega and same

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
compared to the Galaxy mega and same
goes<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:22.020> Sony<00:02:22.410> Xperia<00:02:22.770> said<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.250> the

Nokia Lumia 920 ok you know taking a
look<00:02:26.820> at<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.270> specs<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.380> Samsung<00:02:28.710> Galaxy

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
look at the specs the Samsung Galaxy

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.310 
look at the specs the Samsung Galaxy
mega<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> dual-core<00:02:30.690> 1.7

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.310 
mega is going to have a dual-core 1.7
gigahertz<00:02:31.920> CPU<00:02:32.360> which<00:02:33.360> unfortunately<00:02:33.690> is

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
gigahertz CPU which unfortunately is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.140 
gigahertz CPU which unfortunately is
only<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.710> dual-core<00:02:35.280> CPU<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.850> keep<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.120> mind

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
only a dual-core CPU now keep in mind

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.770 
only a dual-core CPU now keep in mind
that<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.810> Galaxy<00:02:37.260> s4<00:02:37.590> has<00:02:37.830> an<00:02:38.280> 8<00:02:38.610> core<00:02:39.000> CPU<00:02:39.450> for

the European model and quad core CPU for

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.949 
the European model and quad core CPU for
to<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.350> for<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.190> US<00:02:44.490> model<00:02:44.850> also<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> going

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
to you for the US model also it is going

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.650 
to you for the US model also it is going
to<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.230> 1.5<00:02:46.920> gigabytes<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.880> RAM<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.510> is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
to have 1.5 gigabytes of RAM which is

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.660 
to have 1.5 gigabytes of RAM which is
quite<00:02:49.050> good<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.770> keep<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.070> mind<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.490> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
quite good but keep in mind that the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.610 
quite good but keep in mind that the
Galaxy<00:02:51.090> s4<00:02:51.360> has<00:02:51.540> 2<00:02:51.780> gigabytes<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.260> RAM<00:02:52.440> which

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
Galaxy s4 has 2 gigabytes of RAM which

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.370 
Galaxy s4 has 2 gigabytes of RAM which
means<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.489> guy<00:02:53.670> has<00:02:53.880> 500<00:02:54.720> gigabytes<00:02:55.170> or

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
means that this guy has 500 gigabytes or

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.550 
means that this guy has 500 gigabytes or
megabytes<00:02:55.800> less<00:02:56.340> than<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.209> Galaxy<00:02:57.690> s4<00:02:58.200> also

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
megabytes less than the Galaxy s4 also

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860 
megabytes less than the Galaxy s4 also
it<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.610> an<00:02:59.760> 8<00:02:59.970> megapixel<00:03:00.360> back

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it is going to have an 8 megapixel back

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.250 
it is going to have an 8 megapixel back
facing<00:03:01.260> camera<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:02.370> 1.9<00:03:03.330> megapixel<00:03:03.630> front

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
facing camera and a 1.9 megapixel front

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.380 
facing camera and a 1.9 megapixel front
facing<00:03:04.320> camera<00:03:05.010> which<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:05.640> quite<00:03:05.910> good<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.270> be

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
facing camera which is quite good to be

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.180 
facing camera which is quite good to be
honest<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:06.780> again<00:03:07.350> keep<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.650> mind<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
honest but again keep in mind that the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.270 
honest but again keep in mind that the
Galaxy<00:03:08.520> s4<00:03:08.850> has<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> 13<00:03:09.840> megapixel<00:03:10.110> back<00:03:10.830> facing

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
Galaxy s4 has a 13 megapixel back facing

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310 
Galaxy s4 has a 13 megapixel back facing
camera<00:03:11.310> finally<00:03:12.239> taking<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.840> look<00:03:13.080> at<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
camera finally taking a look at a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.560 
camera finally taking a look at a
battery<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.400> come<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.940> 32

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
battery is going to come with a 32

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.240 
battery is going to come with a 32
hundred<00:03:15.690> milliamps<00:03:16.230> battery<00:03:16.590> which<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:16.860> quite

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
hundred milliamps battery which is quite

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.890 
hundred milliamps battery which is quite
good<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:17.640> considering<00:03:18.090> its<00:03:18.299> huge<00:03:18.660> foam

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
good but considering its huge foam

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.660 
good but considering its huge foam
factor<00:03:19.290> I'm<00:03:19.709> not<00:03:19.890> sure<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> battery<00:03:20.640> is

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
factor I'm not sure if the battery is

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
factor I'm not sure if the battery is
going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.060> last<00:03:21.209> more<00:03:21.540> than<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.930> know<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.110> date

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
going to last more than you know to date

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.890 
going to last more than you know to date
or<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.799> but<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.790> biggest<00:03:23.970> disadvantage<00:03:24.720> of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
or so but the biggest disadvantage of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.039 
or so but the biggest disadvantage of
the<00:03:25.140> phone<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:26.519> storage<00:03:26.940> normally<00:03:27.750> comes

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the phone is this storage normally comes

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.770 
the phone is this storage normally comes
in<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.769> two<00:03:28.830> gigabyte<00:03:29.160> model<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.450> cannot

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
in a two gigabyte model so you cannot

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.810 
in a two gigabyte model so you cannot
choose<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> 16<00:03:32.010> gigabyte<00:03:32.340> model<00:03:32.489> or<00:03:32.790> a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
choose you know a 16 gigabyte model or a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.670 
choose you know a 16 gigabyte model or a
32<00:03:33.299> gigabytes<00:03:33.660> model<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> only

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
32 gigabytes model this is the only

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.000 
32 gigabytes model this is the only
option<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:36.360> choose<00:03:36.690> from<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.530> anyway

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
option you can choose from but anyway

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160 
option you can choose from but anyway
don't<00:03:38.190> forget<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.940> can<00:03:39.180> buy<00:03:39.360> an<00:03:39.600> SD<00:03:40.140> card

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
don't forget that you can buy an SD card
