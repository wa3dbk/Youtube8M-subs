ranges to show what we do shooting at

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.939 
ranges to show what we do shooting at
longer<00:00:17.820> range<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.529> as<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.800> we've

got a collection of quarry today
callenders<00:00:22.470> non-stick<00:00:23.310> pans<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.140> we<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
callenders non-stick pans and we just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.259 
callenders non-stick pans and we just
put<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.640> little<00:00:26.640> marking<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.150> so

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
put a little little marking and so

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.519 
put a little little marking and so
they're<00:00:27.390> easier<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> distance<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
they're easier to see the distance and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200 
they're easier to see the distance and
we<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:28.680> wander<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.130> put<00:00:29.640> those<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.939> various

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
we don't wander out put those at various

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
we don't wander out put those at various
ranges<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> hit<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
ranges and then see what we can hit and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.520 
ranges and then see what we can hit and
they<00:00:33.090> should<00:00:33.239> make<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> nice<00:00:33.570> satisfying<00:00:34.050> ding

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
they should make a nice satisfying ding

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.569 
they should make a nice satisfying ding
also<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.730> life-size<00:00:36.660> row<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
also going to put out life-size row and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
also going to put out life-size row and
we're<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> put<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:40.320> paint<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.800> as

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we're going to put some paint out as

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.819 
we're going to put some paint out as
well<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:42.329> view<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.110> beautiful

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
well because our view was a beautiful

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
well because our view was a beautiful
picture<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> wild<00:00:44.489> row<00:00:44.640> could<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.450> some

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
picture a wild row could do with some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
picture a wild row could do with some
improvement<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.320> paint<00:00:46.590> pots<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.980> range<00:00:47.270> see

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
improvement so paint pots at range see

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
improvement so paint pots at range see
if<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.539> make<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> better<00:00:48.930> picture<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
if we can make a better picture so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
if we can make a better picture so
that's<00:00:50.100> using<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.610> range<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.149> what

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that's using it range and that's what

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's using it range and that's what
we're<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.600> next<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.879> mixed

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we're going to do next so some mixed

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
we're going to do next so some mixed
quarry<00:00:54.510> plates<00:00:55.190> saucepans<00:00:56.190> colander<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.730> two

quarry plates saucepans colander or two

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.170 
quarry plates saucepans colander or two
and<00:00:57.859> indeed<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> lovely<00:00:59.969> picture

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and indeed over there a lovely picture

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.139 
and indeed over there a lovely picture
of<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.480> row<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.649> thought<00:01:01.890> being<00:01:02.579> arty<00:01:02.879> types

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of a row and we thought being arty types

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
of a row and we thought being arty types
that<00:01:03.390> we'd<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> improve<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that we'd see if we can improve that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
that we'd see if we can improve that
with<00:01:05.159> some<00:01:05.339> paint<00:01:05.580> pots<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.270> range<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.720> well

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
with some paint pots at range as well

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
with some paint pots at range as well
mix<00:01:07.740> ranges<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.159> over<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> place<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> down

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
mix ranges all over the place and down

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
mix ranges all over the place and down
on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> far<00:01:09.299> end<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> field<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.040> see

there is a steel plate so we're going to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
there is a steel plate so we're going to
see<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.880> ranges<00:01:15.299> as

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
see what we can do at these ranges as

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.550 
see what we can do at these ranges as
you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> camera<00:01:16.409> they're

you can see from the camera they're

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
you can see from the camera they're
spread<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.880> on

for the distance and to do that you need
to<00:01:32.070> range<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:33.360> correct<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.710> point

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to range and then correct at that point

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
to range and then correct at that point
because<00:01:35.700> you've<00:01:36.000> tested<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:36.750> have

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because you've tested it you should have

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.469 
because you've tested it you should have
a<00:01:36.930> confidence<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.820> with

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
a confidence that it's going to go with

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.380 
a confidence that it's going to go with
me<00:01:39.630> enough<00:01:39.900> where<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:41.070> aiming<00:01:41.240> at<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
me enough where you're aiming at that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.969 
me enough where you're aiming at that
point<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.200> wind<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:43.890> not
