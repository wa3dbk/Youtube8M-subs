I wonder if there was an easier way to

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.640 
I wonder if there was an easier way to
reach<00:05:25.780> new<00:05:26.050> Valley

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650

wonder what's beyond that turn it's
incredible

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
incredible

incredible
one<00:06:41.500> moment<00:06:41.770> we're<00:06:42.100> in<00:06:42.220> a<00:06:42.310> jungle<00:06:42.580> thicker

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
one moment we're in a jungle thicker

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.660 
one moment we're in a jungle thicker
than<00:06:43.510> I<00:06:43.630> thought<00:06:43.840> could<00:06:44.200> have<00:06:44.290> existed<00:06:44.680> and

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
than I thought could have existed and

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.820 
than I thought could have existed and
the<00:06:45.820> next<00:06:46.300> we're<00:06:46.780> in<00:06:46.930> an<00:06:47.050> area<00:06:47.470> where<00:06:47.650> there's

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
the next we're in an area where there's

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.060 
the next we're in an area where there's
not<00:06:48.100> a<00:06:48.130> solitary<00:06:48.580> sign<00:06:49.090> of<00:06:49.300> life<00:06:49.950> according<00:06:50.950> to

not a solitary sign of life according to

the map we should be coming to the place

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.600 
the map we should be coming to the place
where<00:06:53.080> we<00:06:53.170> leave<00:06:53.380> the<00:06:53.560> river<00:06:53.740> and<00:06:54.070> continue

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
where we leave the river and continue

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.710 
where we leave the river and continue
the<00:06:54.700> journey<00:06:54.880> overland<00:06:57.330> how<00:06:58.330> would<00:06:58.540> we<00:06:58.690> ever

the journey overland how would we ever

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.100 
the journey overland how would we ever
