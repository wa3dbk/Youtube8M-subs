here's<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.810> simple<00:00:01.230> goal<00:00:01.439> pump<00:00:01.829> suction<00:00:02.280> branch

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
here's a simple goal pump suction branch

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.900 
here's a simple goal pump suction branch
which<00:00:03.419> can<00:00:03.600> easily<00:00:03.959> make<00:00:04.140> it<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.380> PVC<00:00:04.710> it's<00:00:05.640> easy

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
which can easily make it a PVC it's easy

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.210 
which can easily make it a PVC it's easy
lightweight<00:00:06.720> it's<00:00:07.290> fast<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.130> very

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
lightweight it's fast and it's very

recovering<00:00:11.490> gold<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:12.030> works<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.540> well<00:00:12.660> it

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
recovering gold it works really well it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.930 
recovering gold it works really well it
works<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:13.860> well<00:00:13.889> that's<00:00:14.280> fun<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.519> offer<00:00:14.700> these

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
works so well that's fun to offer these

to recover the gold will to leave your
streams<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.220> certainly<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.730> were<00:00:20.850> on

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

like this can save you a lot of time to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.929 
like this can save you a lot of time to
recover<00:00:25.260> only<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.800> choice<00:00:26.039> areas<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.880> the

handy<00:02:28.470> particles<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.040> safe<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> bottom

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.160 

since<00:02:34.730> gold<00:02:34.939> is<00:02:35.120> heavier<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.510> sinks<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
since gold is heavier it sinks to the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.800 
since gold is heavier it sinks to the
bottom<00:02:36.829> so<00:02:37.579> we<00:02:37.700> wash<00:02:37.879> off<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.299> lighter<00:02:38.510> top

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810

material

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.650 

take<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.890> pad<00:02:45.100> every<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.490> often<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:46.480> I'm

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
take the pad every so often like I'm

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:57.390 
take the pad every so often like I'm
doing

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.550 

now's<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> good<00:02:58.360> time<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.599> remove<00:02:58.900> any<00:02:59.079> larger

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
now's a good time to remove any larger

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.399 
now's a good time to remove any larger
rocks<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.360> don't<00:03:01.360> call<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> larger<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
rocks I don't call that larger but it is

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.380 
rocks I don't call that larger but it is
heavy<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:03.340> not<00:03:03.519> gold<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.000> throw<00:03:04.209> though

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
heavy it's not gold to throw though

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:27.880 
heavy it's not gold to throw though
we're<00:03:05.200> getting<00:03:05.290> down<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.769> finer<00:03:05.980> material

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.890 

that's<00:03:28.520> also<00:03:28.790> helps<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:29.330> determine<00:03:29.660> if

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
that's also helps you determine if

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
you're in a good area you can spot them

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.130 
you're in a good area you can spot them
but<00:03:31.730> what<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.940> have<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.240> pan<00:03:32.450> or<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.050> the
