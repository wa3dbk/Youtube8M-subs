00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 start with a little butter like that 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.780
 it's like I was taught to do 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.820
 onion soup then let's start 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 with a little butter here in the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.760
 center with oil in the heart 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.549
 but that's the kitchen, sir, because 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.350
 eliana my days that I do not cook and I do not 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.119
 it breaks something there was no party that does 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 here of products there starts this favor 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.740
 to not solve the issue 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.899
 be careful with the butter you felt 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.190
 the latter detected that our pan 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.170
 fame very hot title region of the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.430
 fire very well sir reads very well is 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.560
 learning is fine once 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.229
 melted butter let's add 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.869
 suddenly the onions then added 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.090
 Thinned onion can do it too 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.800
 in half moons as you want but 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.750
 I 'm not going to do it in squares because 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.460
 we are that you see steak accedan 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.869
 Limits of onions people and 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.880
 excellence and that 's where it starts 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.159
 to skip to skip to stand out 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 patience controlling the fire not what 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.280
 rob will not rise much 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.350
 temperature you have to be mixing 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.119
 mixing in some way 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 that are still up and there is still 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.860
 you please this is a lot 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.980
 patience will take you around 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.430
 It may vary around 25 minutes 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.020
 up to 30 because what I need is 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.950
 that the onion reduce and take this color 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.220
 exactly this is the tone that I 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.400
 I need advice for you already because 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.640
 spent 25 to 30 minutes look land 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.440
 life the weak onion or zubin with the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.990
 Onion has already reduced the size already 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 candy other there is a characteristic of 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.560
 the onion is that it has a lot of sugar 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.170
 academil candy because it is both xavi 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.270
 taking that tone I need you to grab that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.070
 color because it 's true that the soup of 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.470
 onion thynnus with a coffee or certo 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.290
 the tones may vary and it is the tone 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.340
 varies thanks to the broth that is added 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.230
 thoroughly in the kitchen I'm always going to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 add water right now right now 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.650
 I keep telling you because I have to 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.900
 add flour this is a point 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.940
 very important sir there start to 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.220
 mix will start to stick to the onion 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.800
 it does not matter because the flour along with the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.430
 onion to start to start taking a 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.840
 even more coffee then 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.040
 when you see it exactly when you see that 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.290
 take the coffee tone 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.969
 the flour and keep mixing about five 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.829
 minutes more this flour will start at 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.890
 cook and start both to take a tone 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.230
 more coffee and as I told you that in the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 cooks always in the kitchens of the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
 restaurants there is always someone who 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.900
 dedicate to making iphone backgrounds 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.370
 bird funds the meat funds or the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.640
 fish fumet which is also a background 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.090
 and for this onion soup said yesterday 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.239
 the curl that was made with marrow if the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.939
 background the background be the broth equal 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.430
 does with the bones of the network with 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.290
 vegetables begin flour is added 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.000
 begins to brown where I did my 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.430
 practices in europe that I did in 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.419
 germany valuable clown but ayala 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.419
 academic 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.129
 there was a pot of this size to me 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.260
 they would peel carrots and dad would not 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.739
 show off that way until I bleed the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.299
 finger but and then they put the filleting 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.700
 all the logics then to take it 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.330
 all the pellejitos know where they were going to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.250
 get those experts out of there this pot 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.870
 every week to go well to go watching 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.240
 and that they see cascarita tomato 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.950
 all the sale go to initiation counties 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.540
 of vices mine is not like that lady and not 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.700
 it carries the bones and it does not carry the marrow 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 we are not doing decubitus or 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.600
 concentrated because it 's that we're not going to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.519
 do all that proceeding to once 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.840
 this is what we are going to do is add 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.000
 the useless wine haha that can also 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
 Being a white wine can also be 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.410
 use the open bathroom I do not know if I'm going to 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.450
 let it reduce a bit to that it's going 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.490
 for a little alcohol and that I stayed 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.410
 outside the taste of the wine that will take 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.820
 about three minutes after the three 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.750
 minutes now yes I'm ready to 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.750
 add the broth 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.960
 and it's very good when I add to the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.480
 broth you have to add a little flavor and 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.760
 there we can add one or two sheets of 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.350
 laurel more do not remember what always 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.090
 I tell them you have to show me of the 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.600
 herbs or spices 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.190
 gives a lot of flavor very well the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.080
 feature that has the soup of 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.660
 onion is that up once you 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.600
 serve him a slice of baguette 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.510
 with gruyere cheese they put it in the oven 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.870
 that it stays well roasted in the bread 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.690
 since it melts the cheese and that's what 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.240
 they put once the soup is served but 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.350
 The time is not like that and I'm already 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.350
 salivating me what 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.629
 the one of us is going to serve you in a pan 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.490
 peasant then I'm basically 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:34.139
 doing the same takes bread then 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.759
 we make a cover more or less like that someone 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.240
 my fingers are thundering or is it my 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.240
 imagination 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.460
 the peeling the boy aras would say my 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.460
 granny the shampoo 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.990
 very well we are going to dump ourselves to the 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.759
 background because then when I entered the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.270
 soup will start to soak the bread and not 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.270
 it's going to happen 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.560
 so that he is ready like this and that he is super 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.599
 soria has expressed we will be 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.360
 mixing mixture is not going to thicken 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:09.180
 we're going to just lightly serve her 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:16.949
 the bread and the gruyere that if you do not 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:18.990
 wants to use gruyere because it 's because 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.330
 that side we serve him we put him up 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.520
 the cheese and with the heat to start 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.779
 melt the cheese and this is ready to 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.779
 try I put a lot 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.770
 I'm not a fan of the true onion 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.540
 but but in the soup but then what 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:45.930
 pass 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:47.580
 I do not like her also that the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.229
 try as the number but with other 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.729
 monthly payments not on the fingers with 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.120
 another spoon because if we are not going to see 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.120
 to see see 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.220
 all day
