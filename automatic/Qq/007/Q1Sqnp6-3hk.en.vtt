pull it out of the pool and turn off to
the<00:05:20.810> breeze<00:05:20.990> will<00:05:21.140> stay<00:05:21.320> inside<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:21.950> debris

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
the breeze will stay inside and debris

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.040 
the breeze will stay inside and debris
bag<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.180> can<00:05:23.300> see<00:05:23.420> the<00:05:23.510> opening<00:05:23.840> from<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.510 
bag and you can see the opening from the
vacuum<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.560> comparable<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.220> what<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.370> would

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
vacuum is comparable to what you would

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.679

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
probably the time it would take me to

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.270 
probably the time it would take me to
haul<00:05:43.840> my<00:05:43.990> vacuum<00:05:44.169> back<00:05:44.530> here<00:05:44.800> hook<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.099> hose

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.019 
fine particle debris in it there's a
large<00:06:47.740> pool<00:06:48.069> with<00:06:48.219> a<00:06:48.279> lot<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.550> leaves<00:06:48.729> on<00:06:48.940> the

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
still moving around I took about 15

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:58.649 
still moving around I took about 15
minutes<00:06:57.009> to<00:06:57.400> vacuum<00:06:57.789> this<00:06:57.909> entire<00:06:58.210> pool<00:06:58.509> and

spa fairly large pool there's another
large<00:07:01.599> pool<00:07:01.990> my<00:07:02.169> route<00:07:02.409> full<00:07:02.949> a<00:07:02.979> little

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
large pool my route full a little

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.610 
large pool my route full a little
particle<00:07:03.849> debris<00:07:04.089> I<00:07:04.360> got<00:07:04.930> about<00:07:05.080> halfway<00:07:05.289> then

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
particle debris I got about halfway then

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.140 
particle debris I got about halfway then
I<00:07:05.650> know<00:07:05.830> it's<00:07:05.979> a<00:07:06.069> drop<00:07:06.279> ball<00:07:06.460> construction<00:07:07.089> you

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
I know it's a drop ball construction you

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.760 
I know it's a drop ball construction you
can<00:07:07.240> see<00:07:07.389> the<00:07:07.449> debris<00:07:07.659> bag<00:07:07.900> is<00:07:08.080> pretty<00:07:08.289> full

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
can see the debris bag is pretty full

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.439 
can see the debris bag is pretty full
basically<00:07:09.370> like<00:07:09.550> vacuuming<00:07:09.940> with<00:07:10.060> a<00:07:10.120> canister

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
basically like vacuuming with a canister

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.570 
basically like vacuuming with a canister
up<00:07:10.810> to<00:07:10.930> your<00:07:11.020> vacuum<00:07:11.439> once<00:07:12.069> the<00:07:12.159> debris<00:07:12.400> bag

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
up to your vacuum once the debris bag

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.860 
up to your vacuum once the debris bag
shows<00:07:12.849> it<00:07:13.000> gets<00:07:13.150> full<00:07:13.300> you<00:07:13.330> have<00:07:13.419> to<00:07:13.539> empty<00:07:13.779> it

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
shows it gets full you have to empty it

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.469 
shows it gets full you have to empty it
not<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.259> big<00:07:14.469> issue<00:07:14.669> this<00:07:15.669> is<00:07:15.849> a<00:07:15.879> gray<00:07:16.089> bag<00:07:16.270> after

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
not a big issue this is a gray bag after

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.749 
not a big issue this is a gray bag after
three<00:07:16.839> pools<00:07:17.139> today<00:07:17.500> probably<00:07:18.250> should<00:07:18.490> empty

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
three pools today probably should empty

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.929 
three pools today probably should empty
down<00:07:18.909> the<00:07:19.060> last<00:07:19.270> pool<00:07:20.520> you<00:07:21.520> can<00:07:21.580> see<00:07:21.729> how<00:07:21.789> this

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:21.939 
down the last pool you can see how this

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.179 
down the last pool you can see how this
layer<00:07:22.120> degree<00:07:22.449> bag<00:07:22.659> traps<00:07:22.990> dirt<00:07:23.259> really<00:07:23.560> well

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:39.640 

great<00:07:27.189> job
