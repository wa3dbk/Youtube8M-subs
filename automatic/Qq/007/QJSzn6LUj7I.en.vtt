 great familiar artists as for 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.140
 technology is worth saying about the development 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 french dance technique development grandfather 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 traditions that originated in the era 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.250
 Ludwig of the fourteenth Sun King 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.620
 and he himself danced and that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 really lace these laces 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.930
 resume anything choreography 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.450
 completely lost ballet need to compose 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.460
 again and moreover compose for 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.890
 a particular artist whose la cat 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.729

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.250
 Nuriev caught fire immediately said that this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.869
 role for him but I objected how are you 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.390

 you have been working for at least a month 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.810
 it was then that evening you invited me to 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.970
 the restaurant was lying on the table 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.430
 tablecloths he tore off a piece of it and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.130
 tablecloths and wrote these i rudolph nreeev 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.350
 I undertake to work for a month on 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.239
 Marcos flight go and have 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.880
 really worked with enthusiasm 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.340
 I thought out new things for him every evening 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.220
 lacy movements now and body 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.110
 Kotovsk and lace for several months 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 master the big dancers with them 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 the master himself and his permanent works 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.320
 assistants to iron or i am salman 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.690
 pyanok from the skirt varnish to daughter 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.300
 Pharaoh snag downturn is high 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
 movement speed and generally it 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.090
 gone it seems in terms of the psyche 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.829
 and Russian dancers first master 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 this ballet composed by french 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.700
 choreographer varnish there to music 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.489
 french composer daniel opera 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.530
 on the libretto of the French dramatist 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.299
 Jeanne Scribe matter of course 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.840
 the french school which is to be 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.750
 to master 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.000
 and soloist and corps de ballet 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.350
 suggests itself 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.430
 probably the difference is to look not in 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.620
 sense in style 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 French school is different from Russian 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.440
 its speed of movement dynamics 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.930
 even that number every move all 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.240
 filigree movement I told them 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.670
 smaller difficult big set 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.140
 little things choreographic drawings i don't 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 I can say that in Russia 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.560
 This place p-Russia is marked by other 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.140
 qualities 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.940
 these are beautiful always expressive hands 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.400
 and the most important person 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.290
 performer but it seems to me french and 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.250
 Russian school is very good at each other 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.440
 complement 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.810
 together with french choreographers 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.060
 work and our choreographer tutor 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.459
 and the behavior of la Kotovsky 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.530
 the hero helps to learn not to 7 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:46.880
 great very confronted a little bit in 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.970
 hands shaman small equipment which 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:55.230
 performed at a fast pace a lot of pick 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.150
 and from different like just and at the same 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.579
 time 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.670
 strand and very saturated technical 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:06.230
 such complex elements 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:09.299
 where you have to show both jump and rotation 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.049
 complex transitions from one part to another 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:17.070
 and men in women on very interesting 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:20.549
 all variations are different and guys and big 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.660
 interest is working especially on these 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:30.360
 Miles granny such fanta technique and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.380
 jump little shaman skid quick 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.270
 Tempe she here and they lived very 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.300
 meticulously work each 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.389
 they don't miss any position 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.569
 one cu de pioneer no turn of the head 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.289
 one note which is performed in 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.419
 on between and here it is accuracy she of course 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.080
 adds expressiveness to dancing 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.610
 the plot is the mark of the recession is simple forever 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.649
 elusive gangsters rob 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.899
 good citizens men 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.330
 fall in love with the young ladies fall in love with the young lady 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:04.789
 not the men who fall in love with them 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.429
 and all together try to catch the bandits 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.729
 but all this is not important because the most 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:13.569
 the main thing is the exquisite dancing dancing 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.209
 complex and not just beautiful 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.969
 I think ballet is fascinating to me 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:21.889
 Marcos Lada is a gift for artists because 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.139
 how is it possible to turn into 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.020
 another person other than who 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.909
 you are in our modern life 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.939
 for example, you can become an aristocrat or 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.159
 gangsters who rob me 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:35.830
 it will be interesting to viewers to see different 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.369
 artists who will be in their own way 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.699
 interpret this role 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:43.159
 recession mark rehearses artem ovcharenko 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.990
 Vladislav Lantratov Igor Tsvirko and 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.999
 of course david holberg 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.319
 In the role of Angela, I would like to see 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.599
 Svetlana Zakharov 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.089
 but she is busy now who will dance 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.169
 the premiere is still a secret master will take 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.240
 decisions on the eve 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.369
 but in one of the compositions we will definitely see 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.619
 guest premiere big david 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.930
 holberg and he rehearses two at once 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:06.409
 male roles are mark of recession and 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.930
 Federici I dreamed of working with a drinker 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.479
 varnish there for many years I know very well 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.189
 his ballets for me is a return to 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.169
 primary school because me 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.899
 all movements have to be done very 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.419
 fast footwork much like 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:23.599
 at school since i have to play 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.979
 both roles and mark of recession and fedora someone 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.349
 it is doubly interesting 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.800
 I not only learn dancing but also 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.710
 develop two characters at once 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.960
 for the big theater, la cat makes new 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.300
 original version of this ballet 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.460
 he increased the number of characters and 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.680
 diversified dancing for the corps de ballet 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.930
 choreographer admitted that specifically 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.789
 added new lots to tap into 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.240
 maximum number 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:51.310
 members of the troupe of the Bolshoi Theater 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.379
 always told me I would love to 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.569
 for the Russians to ever see this 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:00.310
 ballet he told me he had no doubt 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:02.889
 that I will put this ballet in Russia to wait 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.440
 just a short week left 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.629
 ballet premiere a mark of decline on 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.400
 historical stage of the big theater 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.400
 watching the event
