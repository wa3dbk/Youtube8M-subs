three<00:00:13.360> two

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.620 

right<00:00:17.560> this<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.429> pretty<00:00:18.820> cheap<00:00:19.150> version<00:00:19.599> of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
right this is a pretty cheap version of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.620 
right this is a pretty cheap version of
the<00:00:20.019> traditional<00:00:20.199> compass<00:00:20.919> so<00:00:21.789> one<00:00:22.180> if<00:00:22.449> you've

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
the traditional compass so one if you've

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.050 
the traditional compass so one if you've
ever<00:00:22.810> wanted<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.199> draw<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.759> corner<00:00:24.759> onto<00:00:25.029> a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
ever wanted to draw a corner onto a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.710 
ever wanted to draw a corner onto a
table<00:00:25.359> whether<00:00:26.109> you're<00:00:26.259> doing<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.560> full<00:00:26.770> circle

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
table whether you're doing a full circle

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.729 
table whether you're doing a full circle
you're<00:00:28.720> either<00:00:28.840> going<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.109> use<00:00:29.259> one<00:00:29.439> of<00:00:29.470> these

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
you're either going to use one of these

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.589 
you're either going to use one of these
or<00:00:30.070> give<00:00:30.279> up<00:00:30.430> using<00:00:30.640> my<00:00:30.849> version<00:00:31.060> use

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
or give up using my version use

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.290 
or give up using my version use
something<00:00:32.110> like<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.230> coffee<00:00:32.529> mug<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:34.150> big

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
something like a coffee mug the big

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.000 
something like a coffee mug the big
problem<00:00:34.629> with<00:00:34.690> compass<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.320> it's<00:00:35.650> got<00:00:35.800> a<00:00:35.829> high

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
problem with compass is it's got a high

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.040 
problem with compass is it's got a high
center<00:00:36.309> of<00:00:36.370> gravity<00:00:36.460> so<00:00:37.390> you've<00:00:37.600> got<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.750> pivot

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
center of gravity so you've got a pivot

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.869 
center of gravity so you've got a pivot
point<00:00:38.230> on<00:00:38.379> one<00:00:38.589> end<00:00:38.800> you've<00:00:39.220> got<00:00:39.250> pencil<00:00:39.790> in

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
point on one end you've got pencil in

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.689 
point on one end you've got pencil in
the<00:00:39.970> other<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.659> draw<00:00:40.839> the<00:00:40.900> circle<00:00:41.409> around<00:00:41.699> you

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
the other you draw the circle around you

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.160 
the other you draw the circle around you
come<00:00:42.879> back<00:00:43.089> to<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.300> point<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:43.659> started

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
come back to the point that you started

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.899 
come back to the point that you started
the<00:00:44.559> point<00:00:44.800> moves<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.579> don't<00:00:45.760> get<00:00:45.850> a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
the point moves and you don't get a

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.759 
the point moves and you don't get a
circle<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:46.390> get<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.540> kind<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:46.839> strange<00:00:47.230> oval

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
circle you get a kind of strange oval

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.079 
circle you get a kind of strange oval
shape<00:00:48.089> so<00:00:49.089> that's<00:00:49.269> our<00:00:49.420> problem<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:50.229> solution

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
shape so that's our problem the solution

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.469 
shape so that's our problem the solution

you can let go go for a cup of tea come
back<00:01:27.520> again<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.690> points<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.660 
position of your travel head not moving
which<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.020> object<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.860> game<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.640> you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
which is the object of the game so you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.520 
which is the object of the game so you
come<00:01:37.090> round<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.540> don't<00:01:40.600> know<00:01:40.870> whether<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
come round and I don't know whether the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.960 
come round and I don't know whether the
cameraman<00:01:41.950> would<00:01:42.070> like<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.400> zoom<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:42.760> but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
cameraman would like to zoom in but

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.969 
cameraman would like to zoom in but
you'll<00:01:43.090> probably<00:01:43.270> find<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.140> those<00:01:44.770> two

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
you'll probably find that those two

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.160 
you'll probably find that those two
points<00:01:45.190> actually<00:01:45.729> converge<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:47.020> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
points actually converge and it is a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.310 
points actually converge and it is a
proper<00:01:47.620> circle<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.270> that's<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.200> big

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
proper circle so that's the big

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
proper circle so that's the big
advantage<00:01:50.440> on<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> flat<00:01:51.250> line<00:01:51.430> travel<00:01:52.000> heads

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
advantage on the flat line travel heads

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.050 
advantage on the flat line travel heads
the<00:01:53.470> nice<00:01:53.680> thing<00:01:53.710> being<00:01:54.159> with<00:01:54.370> these<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.820> that

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the nice thing being with these is that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060 
the nice thing being with these is that
they<00:01:55.210> come<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.690> not<00:01:56.229> only<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.620> pivot<00:01:57.040> point

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
they come with not only a pivot point

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.280 
they come with not only a pivot point
they<00:01:57.760> come<00:01:58.000> with<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:59.940> pencil<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.330> small<00:02:01.990> post

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
they come with a pencil a small post

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.340 
they come with a pencil a small post
that<00:02:02.710> holds<00:02:03.130> disposable<00:02:04.119> knife<00:02:04.420> blades<00:02:04.810> so

that holds disposable knife blades so

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.680 
that holds disposable knife blades so
the<00:02:06.310> little<00:02:06.490> kick<00:02:06.670> comes<00:02:06.940> with<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> blade<00:02:07.479> you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
the little kick comes with a blade you

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.719 
the little kick comes with a blade you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
the capabilities of a normal one pop it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140 
the capabilities of a normal one pop it
up<00:03:21.290> against<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.829> edge<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.790> board<00:03:23.000> that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
up against the edge of the board that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.690 
up against the edge of the board that
you're<00:03:23.209> gonna<00:03:23.329> strike<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
you're gonna strike and that is a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.149 
you're gonna strike and that is a
perfect<00:03:26.299> parallel<00:03:26.659> line<00:03:27.109> which<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.889> running

perfect parallel line which is running
deep<00:03:28.670> into<00:03:29.000> your<00:03:29.090> board<00:03:29.329> obviously<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:30.859> comes

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
deep into your board obviously it comes

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.309 
deep into your board obviously it comes
with<00:03:31.310> two<00:03:31.579> scribe<00:03:32.540> heads<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.049> just<00:03:33.199> pop

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
with two scribe heads so you just pop

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.689 
with two scribe heads so you just pop
another<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.799> on<00:03:33.919> there<00:03:34.069> if<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.280> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.609> use

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:34.699 
another one on there if you want to use

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.430 
another one on there if you want to use
it<00:03:34.849> as<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.480> mortise<00:03:36.290> gauge<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:39.049> I<00:03:39.199> say

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
it as a mortise gauge so like I say

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.819 
it as a mortise gauge so like I say
they're<00:03:39.889> dead<00:03:40.400> useful<00:03:41.530> predominantly<00:03:42.530> used

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
they're dead useful predominantly used

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.369 
they're dead useful predominantly used
for<00:03:43.160> striking<00:03:43.639> big<00:03:44.480> circles<00:03:44.989> or<00:03:45.109> small

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
for striking big circles or small

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.470 
for striking big circles or small
circles<00:03:45.859> but<00:03:46.370> again<00:03:46.699> if<00:03:46.879> you<00:03:46.970> want<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.150> use<00:03:47.299> a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
circles but again if you want to use a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.599 
circles but again if you want to use a
