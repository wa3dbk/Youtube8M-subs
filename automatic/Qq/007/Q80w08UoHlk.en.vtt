00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.170
 Hi Andrei, I understand you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 going to move with see through 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 saulya kushka braid and stop 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 sea, I suggest you another route 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 another plan to nominate among through 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.070
 walk along a straight section before reaching 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 soviet go through customs and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.869
 enter the Russian Federation further 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.859
 come Kaliningrad is the most 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.640
 shortest path ahead of straight 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.770
 farther you aim that can soviet 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.559
 traffic that can be reached 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.780
 Kaliningrad here it looks like this 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.020
 get 1 aim at 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.250
 near the city of Kaliningrad who well 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 mean central hotel navigator he 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.219
 will be right here from this point access to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 both the gulf of Kursk and 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.799
 Kaliningrad hour drive on can 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 be less if i decide 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.010
 that we will only fish in Curonian 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 bay 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.040
 then we will probably choose which guest 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 house or again along the line or ashore 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.580
 Bay has one phone I have 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.990
 guys I think it's not us on their own and not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.640
 spend time on the road because 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 this route if you go about 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.079
 on her there may snow snow icy 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 well usually it's about two hours so on 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.700
 way both there and back to fishing 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 4 hours savage it is not good sober 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 driver fatigue is exploitation 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 cars and gasoline and other miscellaneous expenses 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.399
 which we basically do not need therefore 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.590
 I suggest 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.850
 settle either here or guest house 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 crowd ki at the junction and track and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 federal highway to Moscow here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.880
 there is a good kitchen and inexpensive meters 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 hotel principle is the same to you with them 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.000
 contact and talk again to your 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.670
 choice and but 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 probably my decision will be but not yet 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.790
 little information to make correct 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.890
 the choice 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.190
 I still want to make you one day 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.120
 on the Leningrad hall to try 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.220
 pike perch 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.090
 that very good information comes in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 I now opened closer and grad 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.390
 bay I caught perch and zander in this 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.020
 area 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.890
 here and to be more precise descent 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.380
 We will carry out with ladushkin and if you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.930
 there will be no transport possible from light 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.200
 time guys will help and this channel 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.810
 is the outlet the Baltic Sea it is not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.930
 freezes with light we will need 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.590
 cross over this island by boat and 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.770
 from the island to the parking lot perch 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.170
 about two kilometers and a half or two I 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.560
 I think the numbers will endure nothing terrible 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 not happen that even if all the same 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.480
 kaliningrad gulf i'm pouring out because 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.000
 the fact that sea water here can 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.730
 melt the ice because here is this bay 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 already in the clear water channel clean from 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.390
 water in the light is not there already here here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.150
 ice stand only here on sites where 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.390
 there is no flow of big and where is very large 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.860
 the percentage of fresh water here is all clear 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.110
 here everything is already clear of water is not if 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.630
 excess that's not told about her ride 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.180
 fishing then you spend all your time 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.709
 Kursk you deleted it already you 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.810
 sign but not here this side of the bay here 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:01.209
 this is the sea ​​where we stayed with 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.209
 you on the coal someone 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.610
 I can not see anything 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:18.930
 here's a look we joined with you 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.239
 were here in this place of the gulf here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.660
 sea 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:30.690
 fished here we drove here 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.030
 well, even here is just very strong 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.510
 west wind he will crush crush 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.240
 crush the ice and and maybe form here 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.990
 cracks and open water this office is very 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.140
 big climb but here we do not see sense 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.780
 We pass on you exactly and calmly 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.100
 fishing here here 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.400
 the ice here will be pressed against the edge 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.770
 no shore will form 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.080
 melted ice we can probably here 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:08.030
 in this place of the city ​​take the line 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:10.590
 car on yours here 10 we will leave 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.510
 if we agree with this guest 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.060
 home is our fishing 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.970
 there is simply no transport and donbass go 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.340
 still difficult by car we will fish 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.420
 Coastal here but over there but 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:28.410
 very good roach very large perch 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.630
 less but roach only presence 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.050
 so I will not say I do not like to think of 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.690
 to think before fishing by day and this 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.800
 March 4th Monday should not be here 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:44.570
 this is the first day of fishing fishing four 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.740
 day March 4 to 7 the seventh 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.860
 inclusive just the sixth seventh 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.750
 very good days for the weather 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.620
 for videographers by the way about 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.680
 videographers these guys will come here 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:02.669
 on the train, I do not go or fly 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:07.740
 by plane to this area here 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:11.100
 we have an airport principle and 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.640
 take away from here is very simple and put 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:19.460
 here is driving on a new highway 10-15 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:23.060
 minutes on may 22 here trains 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.509
 the same plan so far if 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.740
 Any changes but there is a change 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.699
 from the other side of mine 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.819
 Sure will wear but I think clarity 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.860
 clear there is already the only one left 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.289
 dilemma with two bays or mayor 2 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.690
 bays fishing and one of the four days 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:44.470
 allocate Kaliningrad but again 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.210
 if there is an opportunity here this here 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.020
 concentrated very large perch either 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.509
 I 'm already starting here for now 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.849
 if the whale change if you take write links 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.849
