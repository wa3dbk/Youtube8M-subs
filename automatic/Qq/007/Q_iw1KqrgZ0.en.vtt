 it's the opening of the score guys 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.409

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.880
 when we are small we can mark yes 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.380
 or the direct ones in the parks post you 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.810
 and he knows I was going to do that he knows 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.790
 I was not going to go 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.799

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.150
 counter-attack 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.299
 played that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.709
 my players do not know how to play anymore 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.360
 do the pass squarely did it happened 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.220
 four big do not worry about it 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.150
 the pass plays with him well go to their 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 in-depth 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.120
 our party in depth we will make a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.349
 little technical gesture because we are 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.260
 like that 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.320
 damage the tipi he lives as and when 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.850
 measuring actions gs technical and 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.200
 frankly I'm allowed a it's very 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.390
 very hard to build in front of him and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.130
 I opened the scoring but it's very 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.230
 very hard to guests seals bones 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.760
 put me in the name of my person or my 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.680
 careful attention to everyone and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.150
 term boom and son my attention you have 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.160
 you still have some more 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.510
 still play well when you go 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.850
 dominates small against 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.620
 attack on hoist of wood that has nothing of the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.620
 everything we do things super badly on board 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.150
 we make the game plan on the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.280
 last one had done something done 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.829
 as if late 1992 reminded you guys 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.360
 when we could attack the keeper 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:36.330
 debate are parties and departures 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.520
 will he get to ridelles go and that 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.520
 do 2 0 it's good that's it 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.260
 well 2 0 we take the front are done the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.800
 break just before halftime that's it 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.010
 good guys 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.040
 Come on, let's stay focused, he's the same guy 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.840
 in the biggest one I had parked in 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.730
 the biggest normal calm without 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.250
 doubt we are at half time we lead 2-0 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.050
 balanced stats I have possession of 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.880
 ball but watch out guys that can 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.380
 very quickly change the match is not the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.880
 everything finished until the last second 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.950
 we give all the lucky watches and then 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.020
 hisses offside two years later it's good 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.460

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.330

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.860

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.640
 humiliated at the rescue corner tension 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.620
