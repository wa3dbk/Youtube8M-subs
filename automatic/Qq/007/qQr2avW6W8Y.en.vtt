00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 you already have to share with you and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.980
 are and said there is tension or the one that is 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.549
 consisting of another bike ride in the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.320
 I forgot they asked me if the island 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.869
 it is foldable home if it is 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.130
 this one I'm using is something heavy 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.160
 but there are other options quite light 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.199
 something like that if they have the need 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 of uploading your bicycle to the train you have to 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.470
 to be 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.760
 as compact as possible and totally 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:42.520
 convert to sell special covers 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.460
 with bikes are not not cheap but 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.560
 if they are going to be going up the train with the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 bicycle followed by a couple of the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.860
 tonada here in skinny there are many stores 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.360
 there are many stores that sell bicycles 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.700
 secondhand can save something 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.920
 of money buying a used one 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.890
 and when they buy it they have the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.470
 option to register it to 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.480
 registrations is done right there in the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.150
 where they purchased and when 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.910
 is simply a form is a form 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.280
 with information from one and this form is 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.370
 linked to a serial number or a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.700
 identification number is put to the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.700
 bicycle that you just bought is a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.370
 decal with numbers and you get the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.910
 bicycle and if it comes to be stolen 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.580
 You can report with the police told 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.690
 because it was identified with the number of 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.120
 identification the bad thing is that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.330
 it's just a letter money aegis and it's the 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.810
 they remove good it would be difficult to identify it 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.870
 to register the bike they tell me it's 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 optional but the advantage of having the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.470
 registered is when selling it because 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.820
 If you are not registered people will think 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.820
 that he stole and you will have many difficulties 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.390
 in selling it the registration costs as 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.160
 500 yen are about 5 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.310
 Dollars 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.220
 I recommend a lot to register their 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.930
 bicycle to give them system unit 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.490
 If you buy a bicycle that is 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.280
 registered to the name of another person and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.150
 if for some reason the bar police 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.340
 of the good accusation that you stole them is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 so you buy a bicycle that has not been 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.820
 recorded in the invoice no 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.710
 you can record what they could do 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.280
 the wheels in the future 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.440
 If you buy a used bike and play 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.570
 that the function is looking for a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.440
 stolen bicycle that little that is the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.080
 same model and color to yours can you 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.870
 stop and ferment by the papers of 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.640
 the bike in this case good if your bike 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.090
 has the decal with the number of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.730
 identification the police will run the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.680
 number in your system just for 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.830
 corroborate that with what you are the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.960
 owner and that is not stolen but that is 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.490
 rag today is something hot 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.890
