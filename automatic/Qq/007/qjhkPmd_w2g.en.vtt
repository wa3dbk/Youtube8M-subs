 counter skills and driving on the road 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 this is the least you have to do is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.270

 bamboo between pique to pull the rodotrem 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.979
 I do not even believe that the PS tank 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 in hazardous materials, the double and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.250
 tanks already have much time though 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 I never pulled a tank either. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 directed a training course with the good 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.030

 Do you have a problem difference or 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 or in hazardous materials such as 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 I said the video there. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 It's 21 pages you'll learn the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.990
 basic tank as it was already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.939
 studying was to show the difference of what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 A lot, my God, but how easy is that? 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.990
 It's easy because here the law is business is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 hard if you have an accident so look at the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.939
 the official guitarist request the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.159

 I am an employee or designated representative 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 The providential vanity is required. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.399
 the cost of the course and the right test and you 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.799
 It has to be plenary. 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.719
 every three years, only the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.390
 tank and the pen down here and I'm 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.689
 each boss is not 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.780
 gotta have qa approve the project would be 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.220
 provided this training then you 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.420
 completely understand here I took a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 basic 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.310
 sure the crew of the tank will have that already 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.230
 I mentioned 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.760
 in the past video there that I've seen with 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.340
 advertising of the booknet talking we are 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.290
 putting the driver without experience of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 tank but with truck experience is 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.319
 My case went there and I got one. 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.420
 tank has remedy has no experience 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 in mandala tanks learns two 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 weeks of course 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.430
 then the course will be practically 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.370
 Mobile in Brazil, Tim is 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.989
 responsibility you do not do the course 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.930
 From the op you will have the course in the company 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.300
 that they were to hire certain not 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.750
 continue bank is almost more I already 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.580
 already had the Anglo basic course as well. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.540
 Because I drove, I'll carry the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.810
 right pallet 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.510
 It's more or less like that, what will you? 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.510
 give just one general in the right 21 pages 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.849
 logic and english 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.080
 We test the test in English to 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.200
 responsibility is practically you 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.110
 know how to respond to the situation know 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.480
 transportation is what you can and can not 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.420
 can the rules of the law because I had a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.099
 accident the medicine was medicine people not 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.700
 You know that cargo is safe and 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.019
 everything that I see in Brazil does not 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.480
 wanting to compare company business 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.340
 in Brazil but Brazil Our Brazil the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.420
 same laws in Brazil and say yes all is 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.819
 more rigorous 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.930
 everything is more difficult because because there 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.660
 when something like that happens 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.000
 There's almost nothing left here. 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:43.030
 because mistake here you pay dearly for your 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.889
 series on a page to study 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.079
 and pass the test and logic company has 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.609
 With faith in me, that's not even in the tank. 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.139
 the week after so long 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.500
 company that will provide you if you find 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.840
 job 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:01.100
 I think that the little book here too 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.000
 the guide book guide to first to 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.350
 answer did not want to respond 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.160
 in Portuguese would be the first case 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.269
 emergency reads first answer 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.859
 the first to accompany what 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.419
 is in the place in the scene that he dreamed ready 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.419
 I think it would translate better 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.530
 Look, I'm just going to give an example here that I 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.370
 I said yes to our friend who was driving 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.660
 a scania 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 he knows the American scheme so much 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.250
 up here and show him here 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.640
 in this video here for him the videos that 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.710

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.980

 isolate the area at least 50 meters across 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.930
 the protective clothing you have to

 thing that we mess with raw material 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.250
 In Brazil, you know I 'm not going to put those 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.320
 protective clothing that is for the 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.420

 remedy that has in the whole country 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.890
 certain tone is not so I hope to have 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.550
 removed its fundamental basis of 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:41.850
 Plans a little idea 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:46.980
 and that other book that's what the law 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.960

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.080
 know that all this and remembering that it has 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.970
 I have been as ray that the police only 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.650

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:03.870
 with everything on the tip of their tongue 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:06.180
 pages the code everything will be good 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.220
 sure the state also the guy can 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.580
 wondering if it really is a 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:16.530
 thing to always try to read and everything 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:18.360
 more and you can not let anything forget the 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.480
 things have to be inside of what 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.300

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.780
 He plays everything, it's all hope. 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.780
 that has given a basic idea of ​​the 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.900
 dangerous goods 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.700
 This is where I think it was this time. 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.050
 easy I had already done in 2002 had 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.270

 in the union mpu plate also loads 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:48.150
 dangerous there not in the neighborhood right then 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.650
 basic is and I hope you have seen 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:55.050

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.610
 in the company 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.979
 This is it, I'm not going to put anything on 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.610
 leakage case, I 'm not going to 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.610
