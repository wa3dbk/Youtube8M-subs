00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
in this episode we're going to do a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.960 
in this episode we're going to do a
comparison<00:00:02.010> of<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> two<00:00:02.520> most<00:00:02.730> popular

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
comparison of the two most popular

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.990 
comparison of the two most popular
mid-range<00:00:03.750> field<00:00:04.170> recorders<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:05.339> video<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
mid-range field recorders for video and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.080 
mid-range field recorders for video and
filmmaking<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.560> zoom<00:00:07.770> h4n<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
filmmaking that is the zoom h4n and the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.190 
filmmaking that is the zoom h4n and the
tascam<00:00:09.599> dr-05<00:00:11.509> out<00:00:12.509> which<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.900> best<00:00:13.110> for

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
tascam dr-05 out which one is best for

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.000 
tascam dr-05 out which one is best for
you<00:00:18.080> now<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:19.859> bit

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you now this is going to be a little bit

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
you now this is going to be a little bit
more<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> comparison<00:00:20.699> not<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.090> much<00:00:21.210> review

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
more of a comparison not so much review

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
more of a comparison not so much review
but<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> comparison<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.010> those<00:00:23.310> two<00:00:23.609> field

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
but a comparison of those two field

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
but a comparison of those two field
recorders<00:00:24.689> from<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> context<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> someone

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
recorders from the context of someone

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.370 
recorders from the context of someone
that's<00:00:26.820> making<00:00:27.240> videos<00:00:27.539> or<00:00:27.720> films<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.260> if

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that's making videos or films so if

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320 
that's making videos or films so if
you're<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> musician<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.609> may<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you're a musician this may not be the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
you're a musician this may not be the
best<00:00:30.480> comparison<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.070> your

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
best comparison for you because your

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
best comparison for you because your
needs<00:00:32.460> may<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.180> different<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
needs may be a little bit different so I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.030 
needs may be a little bit different so I
just<00:00:34.020> wanted<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> throw<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.620> before<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
just wanted to throw that out before we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950 
just wanted to throw that out before we
got<00:00:35.219> started<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> list<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.690> lot<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
got started not going to list a lot of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.310 
got started not going to list a lot of
specs<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:39.090> companies<00:00:39.750> websites<00:00:40.170> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
specs on the companies websites that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.810 
specs on the companies websites that
make<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:40.710> devices<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> great<00:00:41.579> place

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
make the two devices are a great place

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
make the two devices are a great place
to<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.260> kind<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to go for that but really kind of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
to go for that but really kind of
highlight<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> main<00:00:44.640> differences

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
highlight some of the main differences

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
highlight some of the main differences
between<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.600> two<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.620> considering

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
between the two when you're considering

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
between the two when you're considering
which<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.510> both<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> these

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
which of those to get now both of these

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
which of those to get now both of these
devices<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.039> solid<00:00:50.370> features

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
devices have some pretty solid features

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.569 
devices have some pretty solid features
that<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.660> share<00:00:51.930> namely<00:00:52.829> number<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.280> they

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that they share namely number one they

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
that they share namely number one they
both<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.390> nice<00:00:54.629> clean<00:00:54.930> preamps<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
both have very nice clean preamps it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
both have very nice clean preamps it
with<00:00:55.980> plenty<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> gain<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.449> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
with plenty of gain for your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
with plenty of gain for your
professional<00:00:58.410> level<00:00:58.620> mics<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:59.460> also<00:00:59.640> both

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
professional level mics they also both

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
professional level mics they also both
have<00:00:59.940> XLR<00:01:00.539> inputs<00:01:00.930> too<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.250> pro<00:01:02.520> level

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
have XLR inputs too for your pro level

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
have XLR inputs too for your pro level
mics<00:01:02.969> again<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.719> case<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> bought<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
mics again and in my case I bought it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
mics again and in my case I bought it
primarily<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> shotgun<00:01:05.580> mic<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
primarily to use with a shotgun mic the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
primarily to use with a shotgun mic the
rode<00:01:06.299> ntg-2<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.920> finally<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.549> both

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
rode ntg-2 and then finally they both

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.899 
rode ntg-2 and then finally they both
have<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:09.030> similar<00:01:10.220> build<00:01:11.220> quality<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> terms

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
have very similar build quality in terms

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.870 
have very similar build quality in terms
of<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:13.080> sturdy<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.650> feel<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.760> they

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of how sturdy they feel how well they

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
of how sturdy they feel how well they
might<00:01:15.030> stand<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> drop<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> things<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
might stand up to a drop and things of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.830 
might stand up to a drop and things of
that<00:01:17.040> nature<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> case<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> tascam<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that nature in the case of the tascam it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
that nature in the case of the tascam it
is<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.049> aluminum<00:01:19.290> body<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:20.700> good

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is an aluminum body pretty good

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
is an aluminum body pretty good
protection<00:01:21.060> around<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> microphones<00:01:22.259> very

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
protection around the microphones very

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
protection around the microphones very
solid<00:01:23.520> feel<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> zoom<00:01:24.299> h4n<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
solid feel on the zoom h4n it's a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.330 
solid feel on the zoom h4n it's a
rubberized<00:01:25.439> body<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
rubberized body which is kind of a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
rubberized body which is kind of a
unique<00:01:26.520> thing<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.720> seems<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.170> would

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
unique thing which seems like it would

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.160 
unique thing which seems like it would
take<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> impact<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> drop<00:01:29.369> pretty<00:01:29.579> well

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
take the impact of a drop pretty well

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
take the impact of a drop pretty well
although<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> zoom<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.189> mics<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.549> a

although on the zoom the the mics are a
little<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.210> exposed<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.900> either

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
little bit more exposed but in either

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
little bit more exposed but in either
case<00:01:34.140> they're<00:01:34.890> both<00:01:34.920> pretty<00:01:35.490> well<00:01:35.729> made<00:01:35.939> there

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
case they're both pretty well made there

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
case they're both pretty well made there
are<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> couple<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.049> different<00:01:37.680> features<00:01:38.070> on

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
are a couple of different features on

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010 
are a couple of different features on
the<00:01:38.640> zoom<00:01:38.850> h4n<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.390> may<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> better

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the zoom h4n that may make it a better

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
you to overdub so for example if you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.860 
you to overdub so for example if you
record<00:02:36.130> two<00:02:36.280> tracks<00:02:36.580> at<00:02:36.760> one<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.180> one<00:02:37.390> take<00:02:37.660> you

can come back and record an additional

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.710 
can come back and record an additional
two<00:02:39.490> tracks<00:02:39.790> or<00:02:40.030> maybe<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.390> one<00:02:40.540> track

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
two tracks or maybe just one track

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.610 
the first one that was really important
to<00:03:18.340> me<00:03:18.400> was<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.630> has<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:20.110> switch<00:03:20.590> that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
to me was that it has a switch that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.870 
to me was that it has a switch that
allows<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> select<00:03:21.460> whether<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
allows you to select whether the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.250 
allows you to select whether the
microphone<00:03:22.390> inputs<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:22.960> going<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.170> be

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
microphone inputs are going to be

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.650 
microphone inputs are going to be
microphone<00:03:23.860> level<00:03:24.340> inputs<00:03:24.730> or<00:03:24.940> line<00:03:25.450> level

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
microphone level inputs or line level

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.820 
microphone level inputs or line level
inputs<00:03:26.080> now<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.380> an<00:03:26.470> important

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
inputs now that's an important

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.500 
inputs now that's an important
distinction<00:03:27.100> because<00:03:27.340> if<00:03:27.850> you're<00:03:28.330> recording

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
distinction because if you're recording

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.760 
distinction because if you're recording
microphones<00:03:29.110> obviously<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.470> want<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> mic

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
microphones obviously you want a mic

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.500 
microphones obviously you want a mic
level<00:03:30.070> input<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.460> you're<00:03:30.580> recording<00:03:30.850> off<00:03:31.210> of<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
level input if you're recording off of a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.320 
level input if you're recording off of a
soundboard<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.290> example<00:03:32.620> at<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.740> live<00:03:32.980> concert

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
soundboard for example at a live concert

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.660 
soundboard for example at a live concert
you<00:03:34.330> want<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> line<00:03:34.840> level<00:03:35.020> input<00:03:35.440> now<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
you want the line level input now the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.600 
you want the line level input now the
zoom<00:03:37.450> doesn't<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.560> when<00:03:39.370> I've

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
zoom doesn't have this and when I've

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.220 
zoom doesn't have this and when I've
read<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.030> number<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.600> reviews<00:03:41.080> where

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
read a number of you reviews where

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.590 
read a number of you reviews where
people<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.590> tried<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.950> record<00:03:42.790> from<00:03:43.270> a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
people have tried to record from a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.080 
people have tried to record from a
soundboard<00:03:44.230> into<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.860> zoom<00:03:45.040> h4n<00:03:45.190> what

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
soundboard into the zoom h4n what

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.220 
soundboard into the zoom h4n what
they're<00:03:46.240> finding<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.720> sounds<00:03:46.990> like<00:03:47.110> it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
they're finding is it sounds like it's

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.570 
they're finding is it sounds like it's
sending<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.560> line<00:03:47.770> level<00:03:47.950> signal<00:03:48.070> which<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.550> a

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
sending a line level signal which is a

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.900 
sending a line level signal which is a
stronger<00:03:49.150> signal<00:03:49.360> in<00:03:50.230> through<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.190> preamps

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
stronger signal in through the preamps

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.850 
stronger signal in through the preamps
and<00:03:52.060> trying<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.540> amplify<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.110> even<00:03:53.410> more<00:03:53.590> and

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
and trying to amplify it even more and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.100 
and trying to amplify it even more and
so<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.700> ends<00:03:55.209> up<00:03:55.270> with<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.540> really<00:03:55.840> bad

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
so it ends up with this really bad

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.449 
so it ends up with this really bad
signal<00:03:56.530> that's<00:03:56.680> very<00:03:56.860> noisy

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
signal that's very noisy

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.640 
signal that's very noisy
whereas<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.330> tascam<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.380> switch

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
whereas on the tascam you just switch

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.199 
whereas on the tascam you just switch
that<00:03:59.680> switch<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.160> line<00:04:00.490> level<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.060> get<00:04:01.180> a

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
that switch to line level and you get a

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.760 
that switch to line level and you get a
beautiful<00:04:01.450> recording<00:04:02.140> straight<00:04:02.470> into<00:04:02.680> the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
beautiful recording straight into the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.470 
beautiful recording straight into the
recorder<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.760> other<00:04:03.880> thing<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.120> really

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
recorder the other thing that really

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.090 
recorder the other thing that really
sets<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.780> task<00:04:05.020> em<00:04:05.260> apart<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.920> dual

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
sets a task em apart is it's a dual

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.830 
sets a task em apart is it's a dual
battery<00:04:06.580> system<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:07.120> comes<00:04:07.270> with<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> built-in

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
battery system it comes with a built-in

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.360 
battery system it comes with a built-in
lithium<00:04:08.050> ion<00:04:08.470> battery<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.100> charge

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
lithium ion battery that you can charge

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.520 
lithium ion battery that you can charge
by<00:04:09.550> plugging<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.360> USB<00:04:10.840> cable<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.320> your

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
by plugging in a USB cable to your

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.170 
by plugging in a USB cable to your
device<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.160> then<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.490> your<00:04:12.550> computer<00:04:13.030> and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
device and then to your computer and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.630 
device and then to your computer and
then<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.959> also<00:04:14.110> will<00:04:14.530> support<00:04:14.950> double<00:04:15.550> a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
then it also will support double a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.400 
then it also will support double a
batteries<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.450> will<00:04:16.570> switch<00:04:16.840> between<00:04:17.080> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
batteries and it will switch between the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.740 
batteries and it will switch between the
two<00:04:17.440> depending<00:04:18.040> on<00:04:18.190> how<00:04:19.060> much<00:04:19.209> charge<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.600> left

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
two depending on how much charge is left

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.479 
two depending on how much charge is left
so<00:04:20.140> for<00:04:20.290> example<00:04:20.590> if<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.739> start<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.070> recording

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
so for example if you start a recording

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.430 
so for example if you start a recording
it's<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.850> off<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.120> doublea's<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:23.320> get

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's going off of the doublea's you get

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.630 
it's going off of the doublea's you get
halfway<00:04:23.590> through<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.950> recording<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.520> those

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
halfway through the recording and those

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.100 
halfway through the recording and those
are<00:04:24.729> running<00:04:24.970> low<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.419> will

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
are running low it will

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.540 
are running low it will
quickly<00:04:26.379> switch<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.099> lithium-ion

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
quickly switch to the lithium-ion

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.820 
quickly switch to the lithium-ion
battery<00:04:28.090> without<00:04:28.930> turning<00:04:29.590> off<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
battery without turning off the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.429 
battery without turning off the
recording<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.460> will<00:04:30.550> continue<00:04:30.939> to<00:04:31.060> record

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
recording so it will continue to record

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.929 
recording so it will continue to record
fantastic<00:04:32.439> feature<00:04:32.680> now<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.699> end<00:04:33.849> these

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
fantastic feature now in the end these

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.520 
fantastic feature now in the end these
devices<00:04:34.419> are<00:04:34.539> very<00:04:34.569> similar<00:04:35.139> their<00:04:35.379> built-in

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
devices are very similar their built-in

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.230 
devices are very similar their built-in
mics<00:04:35.889> are<00:04:36.099> pretty<00:04:36.340> much<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.699> same<00:04:36.729> in<00:04:37.090> terms

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
mics are pretty much the same in terms

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.520 
mics are pretty much the same in terms
of<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.449> quality<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:37.990> get<00:04:38.080> out<00:04:38.199> of<00:04:38.379> them

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
of the quality that you get out of them

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.550 
of the quality that you get out of them
their<00:04:39.009> preamps<00:04:39.580> are<00:04:39.669> both<00:04:39.819> good<00:04:40.560> for

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
their preamps are both good for

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.529 
their preamps are both good for
mid-range<00:04:41.830> device<00:04:42.310> again<00:04:42.580> these<00:04:42.669> are<00:04:42.849> 250<00:04:43.449> to

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
mid-range device again these are 250 to

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.689 
mid-range device again these are 250 to
$300<00:04:44.080> devices<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.800> for<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.069> price<00:04:45.250> range<00:04:45.460> are

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
$300 devices so for that price range are

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.999 
$300 devices so for that price range are
really<00:04:45.969> quite<00:04:46.240> good<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.680> really<00:04:47.830> comes

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
really quite good and it really comes

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.640 
my case since I'm doing primarily
filmmaking<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:55.509> am<00:04:55.659> sometimes<00:04:55.960> recording

off<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.389> sound<00:04:58.599> board<00:04:58.779> the<00:04:58.990> tascam<00:04:59.439> was

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
off of the sound board the tascam was

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.559 
off of the sound board the tascam was
really<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.889> right<00:05:00.009> choice<00:05:00.250> for<00:05:00.520> me<00:05:00.610> but<00:05:01.210> given

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
really the right choice for me but given

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.589 
really the right choice for me but given
all<00:05:01.689> those<00:05:01.900> different<00:05:02.349> features<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.599> the

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
all those different features and the

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.570 
all those different features and the
slight<00:05:04.930> price<00:05:05.169> differential<00:05:05.740> is<00:05:05.830> zoom<00:05:05.979> h4n<00:05:06.340> is

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
slight price differential is zoom h4n is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.269 
slight price differential is zoom h4n is
about<00:05:06.789> I've<00:05:07.240> seen<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.479> as<00:05:07.599> low<00:05:07.689> as<00:05:07.810> $230<00:05:08.710> us<00:05:09.069> on

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
about I've seen it as low as $230 us on

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.999 
about I've seen it as low as $230 us on
Amazon<00:05:09.939> and<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.990> tascam<00:05:11.409> is<00:05:11.560> still<00:05:11.740> running

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
Amazon and the tascam is still running

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.279 
Amazon and the tascam is still running
around<00:05:12.360> 300<00:05:13.360> dollars<00:05:13.599> maybe<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.900> little<00:05:14.169> bit

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
around 300 dollars maybe a little bit

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.219 
around 300 dollars maybe a little bit
less<00:05:14.500> I<00:05:14.800> got<00:05:15.159> mine<00:05:15.310> for<00:05:15.460> about<00:05:15.610> 270<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.960> there's

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
less I got mine for about 270 so there's

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.600 
less I got mine for about 270 so there's
a<00:05:17.319> little<00:05:17.409> bit<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.710> price<00:05:17.860> differential<00:05:18.430> but

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
a little bit of a price differential but

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.369 
a little bit of a price differential but
they're<00:05:18.759> both<00:05:18.909> fantastic<00:05:19.750> devices<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.199> don't

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
they're both fantastic devices I don't

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:21.420 
they're both fantastic devices I don't
think<00:05:20.529> you'll<00:05:20.620> be<00:05:20.710> disappointed<00:05:21.039> with<00:05:21.250> either

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400
