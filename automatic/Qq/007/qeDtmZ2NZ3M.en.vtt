00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
about wind noise and all that but I'm

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.040 
about wind noise and all that but I'm
just<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> foam<00:00:18.420> windscreen<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
just going to get a foam windscreen and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.179 
just going to get a foam windscreen and
slide<00:00:19.230> over<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.529> top<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.890> should<00:00:20.100> do

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
slide over the top and that should do

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.720 
slide over the top and that should do
the<00:00:20.220> trick

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the trick

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.340

to do the trick so let's do some

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
to do the trick so let's do some
demonstrations<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.580> I'm<00:00:26.699> talking<00:00:27.060> about

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
here so we've got this shotgun

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.910 
here so we've got this shotgun
microphone<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.630> we<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:30.960> audio<00:00:31.080> we're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
microphone on we have some audio we're

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
microphone on we have some audio we're
going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> turn<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> fan<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.000> simulate<00:00:33.210> wind

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
going to turn on a fan to simulate wind

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860 
going to turn on a fan to simulate wind
noise<00:00:34.100> let's<00:00:35.100> turn<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.489> fan<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.780> I've

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
noise let's turn that fan on now I've

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.389 
noise let's turn that fan on now I've
got<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> microphone<00:00:37.320> pointed<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.190> away

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
got the microphone pointed up and away

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
got the microphone pointed up and away
from<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> wind<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.180> listen<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.079> happens

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
from the wind but listen to what happens

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
from the wind but listen to what happens
when<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> bring<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> microphone<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
when I bring the microphone into the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.430 
when I bring the microphone into the
wind<00:00:42.570> pattern<00:00:47.629> pretty<00:00:48.629> strong<00:00:48.930> rumbling

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
wind pattern pretty strong rumbling

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
wind pattern pretty strong rumbling
there<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.280> we're<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> mute<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there so we're going to mute the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.319 
there so we're going to mute the
microphone<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> second<00:00:52.940> well<00:00:53.940> slide

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
microphone for just a second well slide

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
microphone for just a second well slide
the<00:00:54.809> foam<00:00:55.590> windscreen<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.160> we'll<00:00:56.430> turn<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the foam windscreen on we'll turn the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
the foam windscreen on we'll turn the
microphone<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:58.350> level<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.250> we're

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
microphone back on same level and we're

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
microphone back on same level and we're
going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:03.920> still<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.070> some<00:01:05.250> wind<00:01:05.430> noise

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to do it still got some wind noise

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
going to do it still got some wind noise
in<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> next<00:01:06.659> thing<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:06.900> going

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in there so the next thing we're going

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.420 
in there so the next thing we're going
to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> we're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> try<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> blimp

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to do is we're going to try a blimp

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.120 
to do is we're going to try a blimp
blimp<00:01:09.240> windscreen<00:01:09.720> followed<00:01:10.229> by<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> fuzzy<00:01:10.950> rat

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
blimp windscreen followed by a fuzzy rat

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.480 
blimp windscreen followed by a fuzzy rat
or<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> fuzzy<00:01:12.720> windscreen<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> wind<00:01:14.100> muff<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
or a fuzzy windscreen or a wind muff it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.830 
or a fuzzy windscreen or a wind muff it
goes<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.790> many<00:01:14.820> different<00:01:15.119> names<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.659> let's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
goes by many different names so let's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.560 
goes by many different names so let's
see<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> looks<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
see what that looks like now we have the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
see what that looks like now we have the
blimp<00:01:18.840> windscreen<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.950> creates<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.549> dead

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
blimp windscreen which creates a dead

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
blimp windscreen which creates a dead
air<00:01:20.880> space<00:01:20.909> around<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> microphone<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
air space around the microphone on the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.219 
air space around the microphone on the
on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.060> microphone<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.750> same<00:01:24.990> shock

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
on the say microphone on the same shock

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.880 
on the say microphone on the same shock
mount<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:25.680> hear<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> sounds<00:01:26.369> like

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.910 

pretty<00:01:29.890> dramatic<00:01:30.310> reduction<00:01:30.759> in<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.909> noise

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
pretty dramatic reduction in the noise

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.230 
pretty dramatic reduction in the noise
and<00:01:33.920> next<00:01:34.310> we're<00:01:34.430> going<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.610> do<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.790> fuzzy

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
and next we're going to do the fuzzy

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.090 
and next we're going to do the fuzzy
windscreen<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.840> top<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.260> let's<00:01:36.979> see

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
windscreen on the top of that let's see

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.180 
windscreen on the top of that let's see
what<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.250> sounds<00:01:37.369> like<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:39.710> right<00:01:39.890> and

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
what that sounds like all right and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.270 
what that sounds like all right and
finally<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:40.940> have<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.299> wind<00:01:41.960> buff<00:01:42.229> or<00:01:42.500> fuzzy

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
finally we have the wind buff or fuzzy

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.180 
finally we have the wind buff or fuzzy
rat<00:01:43.610> or<00:01:44.150> Chewbacca's<00:01:45.049> dead<00:01:45.290> foot<00:01:45.590> as<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:46.009> like

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190
