00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
leave that as it is let's make sure it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.130 
leave that as it is let's make sure it's
the<00:01:48.299> same<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:50.689> because<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> might

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the same as in you because then it might

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.249 
the same as in you because then it might
pour<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> screen<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:54.630> maybe<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pour it on the screen like maybe like a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.429 
pour it on the screen like maybe like a
little<00:01:55.590> mini<00:01:55.770> map<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.520> sort<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.320> we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
little mini map of some sort and so we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.080 
little mini map of some sort and so we
don't<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.820> would<00:01:59.939> have

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
don't need that so this we would have

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.929 
don't need that so this we would have
640<00:02:00.840> by<00:02:01.140> 480<00:02:01.820> here<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.240> object<00:02:03.869> following

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
640 by 480 here we have object following

farther<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.620> player<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.160> be<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> edge

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
farther your player can be from the edge

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.540 
farther your player can be from the edge
of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> screen<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.750> starts<00:02:24.989> growing<00:02:25.550> so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
of the screen when it starts growing so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.420 
of the screen when it starts growing so
right<00:02:26.760> now<00:02:26.930> run<00:02:27.930> instead<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.349> 32<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.280> that's

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
right now run instead it's 32 so that's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
right now run instead it's 32 so that's
my<00:02:29.550> player<00:02:29.819> was<00:02:30.060> saying<00:02:30.420> hold<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.989> me<00:02:31.170> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
my player was saying hold on me just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
my player was saying hold on me just
show<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.739> again<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.790> my<00:02:36.180> player

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
show you that again so it's my player

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.130

was<00:02:36.870> per<00:02:37.140> se<00:02:37.349> right<00:02:37.769> here<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.540> screen<00:02:39.930> would

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
was per se right here the screen would

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.620 
was per se right here the screen would
not<00:02:40.319> start<00:02:40.739> scrolling<00:02:41.190> until<00:02:41.940> he<00:02:42.209> was<00:02:42.390> right

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
not start scrolling until he was right

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.530 
not start scrolling until he was right
here<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.799> 32<00:02:44.220> pixels<00:02:44.760> away<00:02:45.060> from<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> edge

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
here like 32 pixels away from the edge

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.509 
here like 32 pixels away from the edge
of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> screen<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.799> would<00:02:46.980> start<00:02:47.190> scrolling

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
of the screen then would start scrolling

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.970 
of the screen then would start scrolling
so<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.120> wouldn't<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.450> much<00:02:48.599> fun<00:02:48.980> because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so that wouldn't be much fun because

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.680 
so that wouldn't be much fun because
you'd<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.610> close<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> edge<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.599> you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you'd be so close to the edge that you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.920 
you'd be so close to the edge that you
couldn't<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.079> anything<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.849> we<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.239> adjust

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
couldn't see anything so we can adjust

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.960 
couldn't see anything so we can adjust
this<00:02:55.079> by<00:02:55.319> changing<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.099> horizontal<00:02:56.849> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
this by changing the horizontal and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.020 
this by changing the horizontal and
vertical<00:02:57.390> border<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.459> change<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.819> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
vertical border you can change this to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.069 
vertical border you can change this to
like<00:03:00.180> let's<00:03:00.690> say<00:03:00.810> 100<00:03:01.709> pixels<00:03:02.510> like<00:03:03.510> okay<00:03:03.870> 200

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
like let's say 100 pixels like okay 200

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.470 
like let's say 100 pixels like okay 200
pixels<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.069> our<00:03:05.160> player<00:03:05.370> has<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.819> warning<00:03:06.209> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
pixels so our player has a warning of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
pixels so our player has a warning of
when<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> screen<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.200> starts<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.590> scroll<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
when the screen it starts to scroll and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.050 
when the screen it starts to scroll and
so<00:03:09.769> yeah<00:03:10.769> that's<00:03:11.250> basically<00:03:11.459> how<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.849> got

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
so yeah that's basically how you got

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.370 
so yeah that's basically how you got
your<00:03:12.090> camera<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.599> follow<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> player<00:03:13.140> I'll

oh<00:04:12.870> you'll<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.020> back-up<00:04:14.290> plan<00:04:14.440> for<00:04:14.830> this

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
oh you'll have a back-up plan for this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.680 
oh you'll have a back-up plan for this
no<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> don't<00:04:15.989> well<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.290> green<00:04:17.590> did<00:04:17.829> scroll

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
no I don't well this green did scroll

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.140 
no I don't well this green did scroll
then<00:04:19.690> case<00:04:20.340> yeah<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.370> really<00:04:21.760> should<00:04:21.970> have<00:04:22.030> made

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
then case yeah I really should have made

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.460 
then case yeah I really should have made
a<00:04:22.180> backup<00:04:22.419> plan<00:04:22.750> for<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.460> what<00:04:24.460> oh<00:04:24.490> whatever

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
a backup plan for this what oh whatever

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.120 
a backup plan for this what oh whatever
screen<00:04:26.470> does<00:04:26.650> scroll<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.010> guess<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:28.980> give<00:04:29.980> that

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
screen does scroll I guess I give that

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.490
