00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:18.650
 and I saw that in our house 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:23.119
 referents and our agents as 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 Daniel and Pablo presenting this unit 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's hope it is not the only one even 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 the last one that we continue doing it and that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.820
 the south of CÃ³rdoba at my discretion and my 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.070
 way of thinking 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.900
 always be open from this door and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.660
 showing the units and that is not 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.559
 only the center of our region 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.879
 to do it there are three there are three factories 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.250
 in the world that they make and produce 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 unit which are located at your 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 platform your link tool and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.220
 one of them we have to our country 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.400
 of Argentina is going to leave for everything 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.400
 for everything Latin America and even 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.610
 up European European country that we 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 we are going to export is a pride to kiss 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.190
 have it and that it is totally Argentine and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 give reliability to people who are 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.190
 deserves to have a product of this the 13 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.580
 versions are divided into four 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.380
 units that are going to be simple cabin 2.5 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.040
 in up to 140 horses later we have 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.210
 122 also 44 unit of 2.2 cabins 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.410
 simple 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.490
 then we have xl plus and xl is in 2.2 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:53.229
 in double cab also 44 versions of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.360
 this same after we have in 3.05 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.280
 versions that will make it where 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.450
 limited manual and automatic versions 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.300
 and this version that we're going 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.280
 presenting later that the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.280
 person who is unfaithful and here 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.130
 and beyond all the comments that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.920
 you did and what is it 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.980
 difference from the competition 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.510
 we know that a lot of amarok has been sold 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.010
 the fight with Toyota is important without 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 place to doubt 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.790
 and if it's a fight that's good at this in 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.730
 these pickup segments always the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 let's have the difference that we 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.970
 we mark with this pick up with this 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 product in our country today is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.970
 what he spoke had been a lot of emphasis 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.680
 in the robustness in this epic 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.930
 we are a pioneer in what the engine we are 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.530
 since on motorcycle in the motor more 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.360
 Robust that comes to the market with its 3.2 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.980
 liter of 200 horses and at the same time 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.660
 in all the versions that we were 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.180
 talking about going to see that they are 13 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.030
 versions that we bring to the market 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.310
 we are practically a pioneer in what is going 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.880
 to be simple cabin nas tells you 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.980
 is what makes us different that marks us 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.670
 fundamentally in this type of unit 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.250
 that people are already looking for security 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.880
 comfort and we have all that and you 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.130
 we give a little more power to those people 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.599
 with a more robust motor bed that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.300
 that will give us in simple cabin and in 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.400
 the characteristic robustness of fort a lo 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.040
 throughout its history we are 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.500
 talking about one of a vehicle oriented 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.140
 especially to work with a 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.090
 load capacity that simple cabin the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.989
 Simple cabin load capacity is going to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.239
 be between 750 and 800 kilos 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.319
 that we have a very good capacity to 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.530
 load 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.310
 the others as you will have appreciated in 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.410
 the videos that we have spent informative 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.680
 We have a load capacity up to one 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.680
 ton 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.480
 so as not to confuse people a lot because 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.639
 out there talking to those who are 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 understood this unit has more than 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.639
 four hundred seventy eighty meters 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.979
 Newton meters of torque 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.419
 is the burning newton-meter author who has 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:32.180
 in this segment then we come up with 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.719
 a unit as I repeat you again with 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.800
 your robot with its simple cabin in two 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:42.620
 points without knowing in his 2.2 of 140 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.849
 horses the other at 145 the colon 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.930
 no collateral and this 3.2-liter engine 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:54.460
 of 200 horses in which the one that parrot 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.460
 unique in marking the Koran 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.750
 ah
