00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
into a flash and quick infusion but if

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.720 
into a flash and quick infusion but if
you<00:00:40.720> had<00:00:40.810> more<00:00:40.989> time<00:00:41.170> less<00:00:41.590> key<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:42.010> less<00:00:42.310> vodka

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
you had more time less key to less vodka

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.850 
you had more time less key to less vodka
not<00:00:43.540> so<00:00:43.960> many<00:00:44.110> people<00:00:44.200> know<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.800> but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
not so many people know this but

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.630 
not so many people know this but
actually<00:00:45.370> tea<00:00:46.200> works<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:48.070> same<00:00:48.280> way<00:00:48.489> in

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
actually tea works the same way in

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.220 
actually tea works the same way in
alcohol<00:00:49.090> as<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.300> would<00:00:49.450> employ<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:49.899> in<00:00:49.989> water

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
alcohol as it would employ it in water

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.260 
alcohol as it would employ it in water
so<00:00:50.770> infuses<00:00:51.309> very<00:00:51.489> quickly<00:00:51.730> too<00:00:51.970> leaving

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
so infuses very quickly too leaving

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.310 
so infuses very quickly too leaving
things<00:00:52.450> overnight<00:00:52.840> you're<00:00:53.020> just<00:00:53.140> going<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
get lots of tannins but to leave it you

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.720 
get lots of tannins but to leave it you
know<00:00:55.960> within<00:00:56.290> four<00:00:56.649> or<00:00:56.739> five<00:00:56.920> minutes<00:00:57.250> that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730
