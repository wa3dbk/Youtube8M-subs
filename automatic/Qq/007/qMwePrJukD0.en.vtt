our couple of bleeder holes on top that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.530 
our couple of bleeder holes on top that
allow<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> customer<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> match<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> much

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
allow the customer to match it much

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
allow the customer to match it much
easier<00:00:39.870> because<00:00:40.460> pick<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> release<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
easier because pick up and release it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
easier because pick up and release it
off<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> carpet<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.350> air<00:00:43.500> moving<00:00:43.739> helps

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
off the carpet and the air moving helps

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
off the carpet and the air moving helps
to<00:00:44.160> move<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> trash<00:00:44.640> through<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> pipe<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to move the trash through the pipe to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
to move the trash through the pipe to
the<00:00:45.930> separator<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> neat<00:00:47.190> part<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.550> when

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the separator and the neat part is when

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
the separator and the neat part is when
the<00:00:47.789> customer<00:00:48.090> goes<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> grab<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> pull<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.739> out

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the customer goes to grab it pull it out

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.310 
the customer goes to grab it pull it out
they<00:00:50.250> remember<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:51.510> hard<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.079> how

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
they remember how hard it was and how

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
they remember how hard it was and how
cool<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.160> back<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.090> almost

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
cool it is is all back in so they almost

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
cool it is is all back in so they almost
always<00:00:54.510> put<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.899> tool<00:00:55.050> away<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.340> way

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
always put your tool away and the way

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
always put your tool away and the way
this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> designed<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> only<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
this is designed it's the only one that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
this is designed it's the only one that
like<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.859> put<00:00:59.039> away<00:00:59.070> those<00:00:59.640> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
like it when it's put away those two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.619 
like it when it's put away those two
holes<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.239> top

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
holes up top

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
holes up top
are<00:01:00.809> sealed<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.320> completely<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.489> long<00:01:02.670> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
are sealed off completely so as long as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
are sealed off completely so as long as
there's<00:01:02.940> no<00:01:03.030> air<00:01:03.180> running<00:01:03.629> from<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.019> then

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
there's no air running from here then

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
there's no air running from here then
the<00:01:05.369> vacuum<00:01:05.729> cleaner<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.150> working<00:01:06.630> as

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the vacuum cleaner is not working as

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
the vacuum cleaner is not working as
hard<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.470> running<00:01:07.860> without<00:01:08.040> moving<00:01:08.430> any<00:01:08.549> air

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
hard it's running without moving any air

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
hard it's running without moving any air
so<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> amperage<00:01:09.330> dryer<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> less<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so the amperage dryer is less kind of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
so the amperage dryer is less kind of
like<00:01:10.680> having<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.950> VFD<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> system<00:01:12.180> without

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
like having a VFD on the system without

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
like having a VFD on the system without
the<00:01:12.450> expense<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:13.950> tools<00:01:14.189> are

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the expense so when all these tools are

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.749 
the expense so when all these tools are
put<00:01:14.490> away<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.299> vacuum<00:01:15.750> cleaner<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> drawing

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
put away that vacuum cleaner is drawing

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
put away that vacuum cleaner is drawing
probably<00:01:17.960> 40%<00:01:18.960> less<00:01:19.110> amps<00:01:19.500> than<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:19.830> be

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
probably 40% less amps than it would be

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
probably 40% less amps than it would be
at<00:01:20.070> full<00:01:20.280> load<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.180> each<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.360> customer

what makes the vacuum system work well

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
what makes the vacuum system work well
when<00:02:26.489> we<00:02:26.579> looked<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.970> vacuum<00:02:27.299> turbine

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
we're keeping our line clean we're not

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
we're keeping our line clean we're not
letting<00:03:01.709> any<00:03:01.920> big<00:03:02.129> trash<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.579> bags<00:03:02.760> fly

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
letting any big trash or bags fly

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.149 
letting any big trash or bags fly
through<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.409> one<00:03:04.409> customer<00:03:04.859> with<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
through here one customer with the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.699 
through here one customer with the
public's<00:03:05.879> are<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.200> supermarket<00:03:07.200> trash<00:03:07.379> bag<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
public's are a supermarket trash bag and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.670 
public's are a supermarket trash bag and
plastic<00:03:08.310> will<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.150> only<00:03:09.329> clog<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.560> we

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
plastic will not only clog this up so we

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.319 
plastic will not only clog this up so we
can<00:03:10.799> just<00:03:10.980> go<00:03:11.099> in<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.519> do<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.609> if<00:03:11.879> we<00:03:11.939> let<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.209> go

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
can just go in and do it if we let it go

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.110 
can just go in and do it if we let it go
by<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.409> vacuum<00:03:13.590> itself<00:03:14.129> once<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:14.970> gets

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
by to the vacuum itself once that gets

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.580 
by to the vacuum itself once that gets
inside<00:03:15.389> one<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.599> those<00:03:15.689> filter<00:03:16.019> bags<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.379> lose

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
inside one of those filter bags you lose

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.949 
inside one of those filter bags you lose
filter<00:03:17.099> area<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.730> lose<00:03:17.910> performance<00:03:18.419> by

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
filter area and you lose performance by

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.539 
filter area and you lose performance by
keeping<00:03:19.290> these<00:03:19.410> clean<00:03:19.799> all<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.129> time<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
keeping these clean all the time and

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.740 
keeping these clean all the time and
keeping<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.970> clean<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.359> got<00:03:21.480> maximum

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
keeping that clean we got maximum

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.379 
keeping that clean we got maximum
performance<00:03:21.989> inside<00:03:22.799> here<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.730> we've<00:03:24.030> got<00:03:24.060> our

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
performance inside here so we've got our

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.930 
performance inside here so we've got our
suction<00:03:25.290> line<00:03:25.530> coming<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.949> top<00:03:26.129> we've<00:03:26.760> got

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
suction line coming to the top we've got

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.729 
suction line coming to the top we've got
our<00:03:27.090> another<00:03:27.540> valve<00:03:27.840> adapter<00:03:28.079> here<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.620> to

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
our another valve adapter here going to

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
our another valve adapter here going to
the<00:03:28.859> hole<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.579> service<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.359> hose

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the hole so that we can service the hose

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.720 
the hole so that we can service the hose
take<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> off<00:03:31.019> clean<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.409> wash<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.949> all<00:03:32.609> of

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
take it off clean it wash it and all of

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.129 
take it off clean it wash it and all of
the<00:03:32.790> trash<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.389> ends<00:03:33.629> up<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.900> bottom

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
the trash in here ends up in the bottom

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.809 
the trash in here ends up in the bottom
of<00:03:34.199> this<00:03:34.260> bucket<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.099> again<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.669> not

glued on so this here could be taken

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.809 
glued on so this here could be taken
down<00:03:38.599> and<00:03:39.709> then<00:03:40.709> emptied<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.699> is

set up with the crevice claw holder and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.180 
set up with the crevice claw holder and
we<00:04:12.959> call<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.260> crevice<00:04:13.560> claw<00:04:13.709> because<00:04:13.889> it's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
we call it a crevice claw because it's

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.849 
we call it a crevice claw because it's
actually<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.489> combination<00:04:15.030> between<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.359> claw
