and the animals around them may have
been<00:06:11.600> unfamiliar<00:06:12.290> but<00:06:12.560> mostly<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.790> locations

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
been unfamiliar but mostly the locations

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.670 
been unfamiliar but mostly the locations
where<00:06:14.570> they<00:06:14.720> were<00:06:14.810> marched<00:06:15.170> were<00:06:15.410> chosen

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
where they were marched were chosen

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.880 
where they were marched were chosen
because<00:06:16.040> they<00:06:16.520> had<00:06:16.670> no<00:06:16.880> water<00:06:17.120> source<00:06:17.890> very

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
because they had no water source very

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.570 
because they had no water source very
few<00:06:19.220> animals<00:06:19.430> and<00:06:19.910> very<00:06:20.180> little<00:06:20.990> vegetation

few animals and very little vegetation

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.400 
few animals and very little vegetation
it<00:06:22.580> was<00:06:22.760> believed<00:06:23.120> that<00:06:23.330> once<00:06:23.870> they<00:06:24.080> marched

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
it was believed that once they marched

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.269 
it was believed that once they marched
him<00:06:24.530> there<00:06:24.800> then

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279 
him there then

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.809 
him there then
than<00:06:25.579> any<00:06:25.759> Indians<00:06:26.299> would<00:06:26.479> die<00:06:27.609> I'm<00:06:28.609> sure

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
than any Indians would die I'm sure

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.169 
than any Indians would die I'm sure
there<00:06:29.029> will<00:06:29.089> be<00:06:29.149> people<00:06:29.359> who<00:06:29.569> will<00:06:29.689> argue<00:06:30.139> that

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:31.179 
there will be people who will argue that

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:33.549 
there will be people who will argue that
they<00:06:32.179> were<00:06:32.239> marched<00:06:32.599> there<00:06:32.809> because<00:06:33.199> there

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:33.559 
they were marched there because there

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.429 
they were marched there because there
was<00:06:33.709> shiny<00:06:33.949> metal<00:06:34.219> where<00:06:34.459> they<00:06:34.579> lived<00:06:34.849> and

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:35.439 
was shiny metal where they lived and

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:38.079 
was shiny metal where they lived and
America<00:06:36.439> needed<00:06:36.769> the<00:06:36.919> shiny<00:06:37.309> metal<00:06:37.579> to<00:06:37.969> be

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.089 
America needed the shiny metal to be

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:41.349 
America needed the shiny metal to be
powerful<00:06:38.599> and<00:06:39.699> I'll<00:06:40.699> get<00:06:40.999> the<00:06:41.119> same-old
