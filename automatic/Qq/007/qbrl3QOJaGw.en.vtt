00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
and I think that's just something anyone

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.860 
and I think that's just something anyone
in<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.460> in<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.789> relationship<00:00:46.300> has<00:00:46.449> that<00:00:46.629> feeling

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870
