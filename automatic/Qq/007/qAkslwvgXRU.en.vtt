00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone with you the line column and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.300
 in this video i will show uglich as us 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.950
 make the usual show-off a rare Pontus 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.500
 This glitch and already for a long time at all shot on 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.410
 channel how it's all done that is we 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 her will in this video completely clean up 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.630
 it's all iron 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.789
 but almost everything as many have seen in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 many of my things when using ponte 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.660
 I have it completely without spare parts and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.420
 there without bumpers without a roof so on 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.809
 many asked how it did but this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.059
 glitch 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 he worked afterwards fixed him later 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.050
 worked again and so here it is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 lasted a very long time now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 it works and so i think that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 use until everything is normal in general 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 here and you come in what are generally needed by 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.399
 Essentially, this is all done very easily. 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.039
 let's say we want to clean in this car 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.010
 the roof immediately say that not all parts have 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.109
 you will be removed but again there will need 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 mix even more parts 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.210
 My new Persian has come off small 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 level and accordingly I won't be able to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 completely disassemble it like this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
 I admit even the same ponta car 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 who uses himself at the shoulders in general 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.280
 go to the roof section and buy any 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.590
 absolutely any roof let's say I already 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.310
 chose a carbon roof we 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 We confirm and now our task is 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 put two fingers on the cross 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.009
 up and down and quick u so now 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.220
 flipping and how after all when we flip through 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.509
 we see through this segment the fact that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.400
 we have a ponta without a roof 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.170
 Now we have the main time to stop 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.439
 that is, so here we press as you can see all 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.409
 we have the roof gone now we press 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.780
 on x and where is the standard roof 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.350
 we confirm everything we go out and we have a car 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.719
 become a gig further if we want 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.009
 let's remove the same threshold as well 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.899
 more precisely not the threshold and the body 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.570
 threshold you can just take off and without 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.520
 all sorts of these glitches now let's 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.760
 go to the body section 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 and in the back we do the same 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.690
 put on carbon wings let's say and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.670
 we start here and there on these 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.269
 crosses push up and down only this 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.299
 is done 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.700
 everything should be very fast and the most 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.390
 the main thing is you have to stop 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.190
 exactly at that moment when you just 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.140
 press a little up and down 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.510
 very fast and everything periodically 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.489
 stop until you see such 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.670
 the animation that you have a car left 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.410
 already without iron further we again 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 rearrange to standard body and 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.380
 leave the same thing and further you also 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.720
 be able to remove the bumper and remove this one 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.190
 back cover back cover there 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.670
 a little bit differently and say so 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.549
 I figure if I do not support 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.349
 I can now put such parts 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.079
 also grille ie all this 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.310
 can shoot in general if you 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.379
 liked this video then put 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.660
 like subscribe to the channel also 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.250
 go group in contact and not 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.010
 forget that we are engaged in cheat 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.380
 your characters and load the content 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.630
 links will be in the description below the video 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.900
 on this I say goodbye to you all good luck 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.900
 until
