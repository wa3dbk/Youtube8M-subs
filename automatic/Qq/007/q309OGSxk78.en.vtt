following and you know I actually bought

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.839 
following and you know I actually bought
an<00:00:27.259> SC<00:00:27.680> h1<00:00:28.250> back<00:00:28.700> in<00:00:28.849> about<00:00:29.060> 1993<00:00:30.550> brand<00:00:31.550> new

an SC h1 back in about 1993 brand new
and<00:00:32.210> I<00:00:32.930> found<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.649> be<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:34.210> really<00:00:35.210> really

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
and I found it to be a really really

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.650 
and I found it to be a really really
good<00:00:36.260> chorus<00:00:36.680> pedal<00:00:37.039> as<00:00:37.820> far<00:00:38.120> as<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.510> effect

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
good chorus pedal as far as the effect

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.790 
good chorus pedal as far as the effect
was<00:00:39.109> concerned<00:00:39.559> it<00:00:39.739> was<00:00:39.769> it<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:40.370> awesome<00:00:41.800> very

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
was concerned it was it was awesome very

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.290 
was concerned it was it was awesome very
lush<00:00:43.190> deep<00:00:44.199> chorus<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.530> kind<00:00:46.429> of<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:47.179> know

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
lush deep chorus and kind of you know

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.799 
lush deep chorus and kind of you know
enhanced<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:49.579> EQ<00:00:50.089> of<00:00:50.120> your<00:00:50.449> guitar<00:00:50.780> somewhat

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
enhanced the EQ of your guitar somewhat

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.869 
enhanced the EQ of your guitar somewhat
the<00:00:53.809> only<00:00:54.019> problem<00:00:54.379> was<00:00:54.589> it<00:00:55.010> was<00:00:55.429> a<00:00:55.460> little<00:00:55.730> bit

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
the only problem was it was a little bit

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.599 
the only problem was it was a little bit
unreliable<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.929> you<00:00:57.559> know<00:00:57.679> stompboxes<00:00:58.429> are

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
unreliable and you know stompboxes are

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.419 
unreliable and you know stompboxes are
prone<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.120> being<00:00:59.420> stepped<00:00:59.899> on<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.829> all<00:01:01.010> kinds

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
prone to being stepped on in all kinds

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.590 
prone to being stepped on in all kinds
of<00:01:01.489> kinds<00:01:01.850> of<00:01:02.059> funny<00:01:02.269> ways<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.879> led<00:01:05.449> an

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
of kinds of funny ways and it led an

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.070 
of kinds of funny ways and it led an
early<00:01:05.930> demise<00:01:06.370> so<00:01:07.370> I<00:01:07.760> thought<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.870> would

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
early demise so I thought that I would

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.580 
early demise so I thought that I would
give<00:01:10.070> one<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.310> these<00:01:10.400> SCH<00:01:11.180> Zed's<00:01:11.510> ago<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.110> it's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
give one of these SCH Zed's ago and it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.770 
give one of these SCH Zed's ago and it's
fairly<00:01:12.890> similar<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.700> must<00:01:14.000> say<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.390> wouldn't<00:01:14.660> say

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
fairly similar I must say I wouldn't say

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.540 
fairly similar I must say I wouldn't say
it's<00:01:14.960> exactly<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.680> same<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.310> very

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
it's exactly the same but it's very

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.700 
it's exactly the same but it's very
similar<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.690> let's<00:01:17.870> have<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.080> look<00:01:18.230> around<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
similar so let's have a look around the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.060 
similar so let's have a look around the
pedal<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:20.120> we've<00:01:20.330> got<00:01:20.480> our<00:01:20.600> right<00:01:20.930> depth<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
pedal so we've got our right depth and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.020 
pedal so we've got our right depth and
tone<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.260> in<00:01:24.260> here<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:25.550> our<00:01:25.820> battery

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
tone and in here is our battery

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.100 
tone and in here is our battery
compartment<00:01:26.840> really<00:01:27.260> easy<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.680> get<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:28.030> and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
compartment really easy to get to and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.500 
compartment really easy to get to and
just<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.230> typical<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:32.420> know<00:01:32.540> cheaper<00:01:33.140> style

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
just the typical you know cheaper style

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.110 
just the typical you know cheaper style
connector<00:01:37.750> we<00:01:38.750> have<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> direct<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.620> stereo

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
connector we have a direct and stereo

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.420 
connector we have a direct and stereo
switch<00:01:41.120> here<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:42.020> select<00:01:42.320> what<00:01:42.650> output<00:01:43.220> to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
switch here to select what output to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.600 
switch here to select what output to
does<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:44.630> have<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.810> direct<00:01:45.290> as<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:46.010> no

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
does so you can have it direct as in no

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.300 
does so you can have it direct as in no
effect<00:01:47.060> or<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.570> can<00:01:47.720> have<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:47.900> stereo<00:01:48.440> so<00:01:49.220> you

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
effect or you can have it stereo so you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.390 
effect or you can have it stereo so you
can<00:01:49.460> run<00:01:49.640> both<00:01:50.350> they<00:01:51.350> upped<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:52.070> two

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
can run both they upped it to two

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.060 
can run both they upped it to two
