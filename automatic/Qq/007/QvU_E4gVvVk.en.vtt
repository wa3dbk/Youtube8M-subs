sites but doesn't really interest me as
much<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.750> some<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> sports<00:00:55.140> betting<00:00:55.379> stuff

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

I<00:00:56.070> came<00:00:56.910> along<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.420> didn't<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.440> believe<00:00:58.770> any

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I came along I didn't really believe any

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.910 
I came along I didn't really believe any
of<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> any<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.780> those<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.410> those<00:01:01.559> sorts

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
of the any of those any of those sorts

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
of the any of those any of those sorts
of<00:01:02.010> sites<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.550> said<00:01:02.789> guaranteed<00:01:03.390> wins<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
of sites which said guaranteed wins and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.359 
of sites which said guaranteed wins and
all<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.769> sort<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> stuff<00:01:06.740> but<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.010> key

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
all of that sort of stuff but the key

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
all of that sort of stuff but the key
difference<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:09.030> me<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.780> bet<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> win

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
difference for me was you bet you win

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.370 
difference for me was you bet you win
was<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.210> simplistic<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.110> thought<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
was it was very simplistic I thought the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.100 
was it was very simplistic I thought the
guides<00:01:13.619> were<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.100> easy<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> follow<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
guides were very easy to follow I

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.310 
guides were very easy to follow I
thought<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:17.869> some<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> advice<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.320> just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
thought that some of the advice and just

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.690 
thought that some of the advice and just
that<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> fact<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.340> won

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that the fact that I've actually won

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.140 
that the fact that I've actually won
some<00:01:24.000> money<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> amazing<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:26.150> as

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
some money to be an amazing thing as

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
some money to be an amazing thing as
