made by Belkin and as you can see the
little<00:01:01.890> spot<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.600> messed<00:01:04.500> up

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
little spot where all of them messed up

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
little spot where all of them messed up
at<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.820> squared<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> gives<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
at this one squared so that gives you a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
at this one squared so that gives you a
little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:08.119> less<00:01:09.119> chance<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> pick<00:01:09.900> getting

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
little bit less chance to pick getting

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
little bit less chance to pick getting
messed<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:11.430> gonna<00:01:11.580> unbox<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
them and show you that all right so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.310 
them and show you that all right so
here's<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.670> connection<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
here's the connection to it which is the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.520 
here's the connection to it which is the
ward<00:02:25.800> after<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.510> USB<00:02:27.930> part<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.380> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
ward after and then the USB part to it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.260 
ward after and then the USB part to it
let<00:02:28.950> me<00:02:29.040> connect<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> my<00:02:29.670> source<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.150> they

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
let me connect it to my source and they

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
let me connect it to my source and they
were<00:02:30.330> gonna<00:02:30.480> connect<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> phone<00:02:32.060> all

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
were gonna connect it to the phone all

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.800 
were gonna connect it to the phone all
right<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.630> now<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.780> if

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
right so now here it is and let's see if

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.790 
right so now here it is and let's see if
it's<00:02:37.080> reversible<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.220> didn't<00:02:38.790> check<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.330> oh

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it's reversible I didn't check that oh

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.000 
it's reversible I didn't check that oh
what<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> fail<00:02:41.070> what<00:02:41.790> Sam<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.450> charging<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
what a fail what Sam it's charging that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.979 
what a fail what Sam it's charging that
side<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.489> well<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.209> then<00:02:45.360> let's<00:02:45.690> try<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
side as well and then let's try the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.479 
side as well and then let's try the
other<00:02:46.260> side<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:48.650> yes<00:02:49.650> indeed<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.310> is

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
other side and yes indeed it is

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.390 
other side and yes indeed it is
reversible<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.350> works<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> guys

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
reversible so this works and as you guys

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.520 
reversible so this works and as you guys
