reflector<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
reflector so what I'm going to do is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.550 
reflector so what I'm going to do is
show<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.210> fast<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> tear<00:00:25.050> down<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
show you how fast it is to tear down the

show you how fast it is to tear down the
hockey<00:00:26.430> box<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:28.189> first<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> take<00:00:29.400> off<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
hockey box so first you take off the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.430 
hockey box so first you take off the
flexure<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> front<00:00:33.960> reflector

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
flexure this is just a front reflector

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280 
flexure this is just a front reflector
then<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.270> inner<00:00:36.719> reflector<00:00:37.170> which

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
then you have the inner reflector which

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:51.290 
then you have the inner reflector which
is<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> same<00:00:49.680> way<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> big<00:00:50.730> wood<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
is the same way it had a big wood you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.750 
is the same way it had a big wood you
got<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:53.160> same<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.750> regular<00:00:55.530> one

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
got it the same way for a regular one

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
got it the same way for a regular one
basically<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.289> until

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
basically I got to do on the back until

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.709 
basically I got to do on the back until
your<00:00:59.070> chrome<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.120> had<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> range<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
your chrome you know you had a range of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.119 
your chrome you know you had a range of
snap<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.489> pop<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> off

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
snap and then you can pop it off

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.800 
snap and then you can pop it off
normally<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
normally you take it and then it's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.850 
normally you take it and then it's
basically<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.830> what<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
basically just a like right here what I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
basically just a like right here what I
like<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
like about this is this is gonna make a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.020 
like about this is this is gonna make a
big<00:01:13.229> difference<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.650> me<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.820> take

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
big difference for me with time to take

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590 
big difference for me with time to take
it<00:01:15.119> apart<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.009> I'll<00:01:17.009> sit<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:18.330> here

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it apart and I'll sit it up right here

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.690 
it apart and I'll sit it up right here
basically<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.100> look<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> inside<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
basically you look on the inside of it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
basically you look on the inside of it
it<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.210> ring<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.990> cause<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> called

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it has a ring there cause it's called

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
it has a ring there cause it's called
speed<00:01:25.799> ring<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.460> also<00:01:26.790> makes<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.210> eat<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
speed ring and also makes me eat the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.560 
speed ring and also makes me eat the
Rotato<00:01:28.100> what<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:31.520> push<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.570> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
Rotato what you do you push down and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:53.000 
Rotato what you do you push down and
pull<00:01:33.810> out

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.070 

and<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.490> gets<00:01:54.610> easier<00:01:55.120> over<00:01:55.330> time

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
and it gets easier over time

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.890 
and it gets easier over time
well<00:01:56.710> census<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.030> brand<00:01:58.300> new<00:01:58.360> I<00:01:58.480> found

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
well census this is brand new I found

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.500 
well census this is brand new I found
out<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> box<00:01:59.350> today<00:01:59.970> makes<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.180> little<00:02:01.300> bit

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
out the box today makes it a little bit

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:43.500 
out the box today makes it a little bit
harder<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.890> zip<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.220> up<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.330> it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
harder you zip it up there you have it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.900 
harder you zip it up there you have it
it's<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:44.650> as<00:02:44.800> easy<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.070> put<00:02:45.310> together<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
it's just as easy to put together as it

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's just as easy to put together as it
is<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.120> take<00:02:46.300> down<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.970> suggested<00:02:48.970> finding

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
is to take down so I suggested finding

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.990 
is to take down so I suggested finding
vices<00:02:49.959> before<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.560> take<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> soft<00:02:51.640> box<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
vices before I take the soft box the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.750 
vices before I take the soft box the
bills<00:02:52.209> come<00:02:52.390> about<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.870> guess<00:02:53.459> $289<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.640> this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
bills come about I guess $289 for this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.580 
bills come about I guess $289 for this
size<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.770> right<00:02:56.950> above<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.870> $389<00:02:58.870> 469

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
size the one right above it is $389 469

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.040 
size the one right above it is $389 469
inch<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:00.850> they<00:03:00.940> also<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:01.750> that's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
inch and then they also have one that's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.590 
inch and then they also have one that's
or<00:03:03.040> they<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.310> two<00:03:03.580> smaller<00:03:03.970> than<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.330> one

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
or they have two smaller than this one

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.960 
or they have two smaller than this one
and<00:03:04.810> two<00:03:05.650> bigger<00:03:05.920> than<00:03:06.100> this<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.910> think

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
and two bigger than this one but I think

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.610 
and two bigger than this one but I think
this<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.390> perfect<00:03:07.600> size<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.320> do<00:03:08.410> full

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
this is a perfect size you can do full
