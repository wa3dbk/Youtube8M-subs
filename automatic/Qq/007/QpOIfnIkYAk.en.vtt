00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.570
 Hello everyone 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.920
 that is to say that today we are 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.619
 found for a new video of 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.150
 glitch on call of duty black ops 2 en 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.070
 multiplayer to get out of the map 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.779
 melton so the one that I have pretty hard by 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.130
 against to realize it where you go 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.470
 have to find you in the same place 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.930
 that me in the video of which this little corner 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.060
 you will ask your teammate 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.070
 unlock strategic parcels and 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.560
 wanted to throw on it and normally he 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.360
 is going to be a package that will push you 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
 in the wall so be you go 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 directly from outside the map 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.920
 or otherwise well, you're going to be a little 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.110
 in the wall is your friend going to have you 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.470
 jump on it so that you get out of the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.050
 map 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.030
 so like you the 10th gleeks is 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.410
 not very easy I advise you when 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.150
 same because fnac authors is really 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.500
 beautiful and you have a lot of 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.059
 things to do 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.009
 but that's sure it's not very 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.170
 easy to go out so you just need one 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.700
 little patience so 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.650
 once outside the map as I 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.020
 wanted to say, well, we'll get you 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.570
 name a lot of things to achieve and 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.460
 Lots to explore as 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.799
 is behind me in the video you 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.569
 will have a hill and going up while 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.159
 top of this hill and ben you 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.999
 can even touch the sky barrier 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.369
 so high calais 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.229
 or otherwise you'll even be able to go like 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.030
 me in the video to the right 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.189
 so there you will be on the side of the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 map and you will really have a lot 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.609
 of things to explore because it's the fnap 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.679
 like blidi it's still pretty 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.179
 big and you really ready to have fun 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.130
 so I think it's really a 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.479
 teuf maps very interesting because there are 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 really a lot of little details 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.139
 I even think we could even 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.869
 find a glitch at the top of the map 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:52.060
 after that one would just have to look for me 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.130
 and find it I take advantage of this 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.929
 video to announce that I have 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.060
 completed the compilation of glitch on the 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.579
 card nocton me so she will arrive 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.049
 normally this weekend so here's the 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.999
 video ends I really hope that 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.770
 this August map on sea â€‹â€‹dom will have pleased you 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.539
 so it's not very easy but I 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
 think with a little bit of time you're going 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.260
 to arrive fairly easily and so that's it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.640
 the video ends I really hope 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.200
 that you enjoyed the no 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.090
 maximum green thumb chain for this super 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.560
 route of mac and for the compilation of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.330
 the fall that I was finishing who's going 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.720
 arrive in a few days and I will 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.890
 say so 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.250

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 state where everyone 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 bike
