atomic brain in the a/b mode this
amplifier<00:00:43.500> has<00:00:44.309> had<00:00:44.670> an<00:00:44.820> upgrade<00:00:45.290> put<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.440> Weber

alnico in it and just upgraded the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
alnico in it and just upgraded the
components<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.699> were<00:00:50.879> inside<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> make
