00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.140 
this is the micro USB 3.0 cable just
your<00:02:55.000> basic<00:02:56.280> cable<00:02:57.280> here<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.940> what<00:02:58.060> you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
your basic cable here not what you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.870 
your basic cable here not what you
talked<00:02:58.330> about<00:02:58.360> there<00:02:58.810> right<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:03.370> we<00:03:03.670> have

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
talked about there right here we have

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.180 
talked about there right here we have
our<00:03:04.150> instruction<00:03:04.569> booklet<00:03:05.160> though<00:03:06.160> I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
our instruction booklet though I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.100 
our instruction booklet though I
personally<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.090> external<00:03:07.900> hard

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
personally think that external hard

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.960 
personally think that external hard
drives<00:03:08.470> are<00:03:08.650> fairly<00:03:08.860> self-explanatory<00:03:09.100> but

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
drives are fairly self-explanatory but

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.420 
drives are fairly self-explanatory but
they<00:03:10.350> did<00:03:11.350> include<00:03:11.709> an<00:03:11.890> instruction<00:03:12.280> booklet

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
they did include an instruction booklet

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.039 
they did include an instruction booklet
here<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:13.750> various<00:03:14.170> languages<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:16.900> go

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
here in various languages and here we go

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.720 
here in various languages and here we go
here's<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.769> hard<00:03:18.549> drive<00:03:18.730> itself<00:03:20.400> stay<00:03:21.400> matte

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
here's the hard drive itself stay matte

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.380 
here's the hard drive itself stay matte
black<00:03:22.060> finish<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> very<00:03:25.060> small

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
black finish and this is a very small

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.860 
black finish and this is a very small
hard<00:03:25.630> drive<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:26.260> comparison<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.459> my

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
hard drive for comparison here is my

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.690 
hard drive for comparison here is my
iPod<00:03:28.870> Touch<00:03:29.140> 4th<00:03:29.530> generation<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.579> can

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
iPod Touch 4th generation and as you can

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.259 
iPod Touch 4th generation and as you can
see<00:03:30.910> they're<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.720> exact<00:03:32.230> same<00:03:32.440> height<00:03:32.709> and

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
see they're the exact same height and

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.640 
see they're the exact same height and
the<00:03:34.269> hard<00:03:34.690> drive<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.959> just<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.170> little<00:03:35.560> bit

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
the hard drive is just a little bit

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.710 
the hard drive is just a little bit
wider<00:03:35.859> than<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.160> iPod<00:03:36.549> so<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.329> showed<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.540> just

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
wider than the iPod so I showed you just

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.210 
wider than the iPod so I showed you just
how<00:03:38.079> small<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.620> external<00:03:39.489> hard<00:03:39.790> drive<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:41.220> so

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
how small this external hard drive is so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.590 
how small this external hard drive is so
it<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:42.489> says<00:03:42.579> Toshiba<00:03:43.120> down<00:03:43.299> here<00:03:43.450> at<00:03:43.510> the
