00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.220
 my name stefano caracciolo are 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 president of the degree course of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 medical radiology technician was of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 protection is a course that forms 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 naturally to the health profession 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 of radiology technician that is of the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.600
 person who is a full participant 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 in the radiological kits make one 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 series of specialized exams in the field 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 Healthcare is an important profession 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.449
 much sought after we have a closed number 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 because the people who register have 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.620
 the guarantee of having all the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 educational possibilities within the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 security hospitals in Italy to do 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 the practice that then needed to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 carry out this profession 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.339
 the object of the studies are of course 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 the functioning mechanisms of the body 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.639
 human the various anatomical structures e 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.659
 the tissue organs and how they come 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.489
 displayed through the principals 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.090
 wonderful technicians that technology 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.530
 medical offers us and therefore not only the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 classical resonance biology 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.369
 all magnetic techniques more nuclear 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.920
 evolved the common financial atac cont 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 use it and at the same time all 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 processes related to the operation of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.170
 these machines fall some with 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.170
 student training program 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.790
 hello they are carlo mili i am the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.640
 coordinator of the degree course for 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.170
 we define medical radiology technicians 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.450
 first of all who is a technician of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.210
 Medical radiology is a professional 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.670
 that operates in the health world can 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.439
 work after three years of course after that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.240
 he graduated who discussed a thesis e 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.820
 after he joined a college 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.159
 professional at 1 currently because he does 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.780
 a graduate therefore being well into near 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.299
 more precisely speaking of order 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.489
 you can click on its activity either in 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.739
 parts of radiodiagnostics that is where yes 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.599
 they make fine reasons and where they are done 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.659
 the one deliberately called le 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.599
 notches as obviously they would be sites of 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.129
 left reading these directions 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.030
 depending on whether you are an Italian American 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.370
 magnetic resonances 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.560
 in the field of nuclear medicine in the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.580
 radiotherapy field and others 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.430
 sectors and Italy are about 25 thousand 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.680
 people who hold this title 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.050
 you find them in all the hospitals there 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.360
 found in all nursing homes in 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.920
 polyclinics and have a relationship of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.890
 work that can be dependent 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.660
 public but also a private relationship or 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.190
 even to VAT number as of 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.540
 recent is happening because the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 type of work changes 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 it is continuously a frequency course 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.150
 clearly mandatory characterized 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.310
 from two thirds of lessons theoretical theorist 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.500
 practices and only one part is properly 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.940
 all practical training practices 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.620
 over the three years so yes 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.550
 the pedocin begins and after the first three 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.190
 four months 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.500
 you have people, people who are 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.550
 of all ages from child to adult 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.150
 to the lucky to the normal person then 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.489
 relationship technology person with 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.830
 very sophisticated mining technologies 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.070
 the image extracting image that 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.140
 it must be the image that you carry networks 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.210
 to the person 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.920
 let's say the certainty e 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.480
 of the diagnosis is made together with the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.860
 biologist because the radiologist who makes the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.060
 diagnostic but must have a good one 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.060
 image on which to work 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.480
 if you don't want to stop 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.310
 to the work of radiology technician 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.330
 you can eventually perfect them with 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.000
 master there is a decent master choice 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.250
 as system administrators I am 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.050
 those figures now dealing 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.180
 of related technologies 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.560
 to data management archiving 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.430
 to the network to sort the data 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.770
 health 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.959
 or I do n't know how to master i 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.760
 those who coordinated the departments 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.450
 time it is not technical bosses with 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.290
 other figures, other specialist masters 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.490
 in ultrasound, etc. but here it is gradually 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.960
 change according to the years of the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.650
 what the market demands 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 or, however, there is another here 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.720
 difficulties because they are limited 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.790
 these are also the master's degrees 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.250
 two years that gives me access to the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.510
 license minutes from the place and I care 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.190
 gives the license is not giving me a 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.700
 car for tomorrow 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.320
 compete for executive posts in 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.650
 health professions sector 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.510
 be careful because it is not just you 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.690
 like you who are of radiology but here 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.080
 all the technical figures of 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.080
