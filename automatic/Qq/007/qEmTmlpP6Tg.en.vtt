hi<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.650> John<00:00:01.949> Daniels<00:00:02.340> from<00:00:02.399> green<00:00:02.639> Lord

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hi this is John Daniels from green Lord

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi this is John Daniels from green Lord
I'm<00:00:03.629> demonstrating<00:00:04.220> stabilizing<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.580> edge

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
I'm demonstrating stabilizing the edge

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.200 
I'm demonstrating stabilizing the edge
of<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.480> piece<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.870> scale<00:00:07.200> nail<00:00:07.550> in<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.670> piece<00:00:09.000> I

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of a piece of scale nail in this piece I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.110 
of a piece of scale nail in this piece I
have<00:00:09.540> already<00:00:10.469> stabilized<00:00:11.420> this<00:00:12.420> edge<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:14.120> we

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
have already stabilized this edge and we

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.760 
have already stabilized this edge and we
will<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.929> stabilizing<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.590> edge

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
will we will be stabilizing this edge

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.580 
will we will be stabilizing this edge
now<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.039> can<00:00:17.160> see<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> unstabilized<00:00:18.000> edge

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
now you can see the unstabilized edge

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.540 
now you can see the unstabilized edge
the<00:00:19.590> split<00:00:19.890> rings<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.430> easily<00:00:21.830> be<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.980> 90

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the split rings can easily be at 90

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.390 
the split rings can easily be at 90
degrees<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.150> fabric<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.949> that<00:00:25.949> causes

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
degrees to the fabric and that causes

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.810 
degrees to the fabric and that causes
the<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.119> rings<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> bottom<00:00:28.699> like<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the the rings on the bottom like the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.250 
the the rings on the bottom like the
rings<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> scales<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> bottom<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
rings and the scales on the bottom of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
rings and the scales on the bottom of
your<00:00:31.289> scale<00:00:31.679> mail<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> sort<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> flop<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:33.180> on

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
your scale mail to sort of flop about on

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
your scale mail to sort of flop about on
their<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> their<00:00:34.290> own<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.309> stabilized

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
their on their own on the stabilized

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.250 
their on their own on the stabilized
side<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> Rings<00:00:39.050> split<00:00:40.050> rings

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
side and see that the Rings split rings

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.229 
side and see that the Rings split rings
here<00:00:40.500> cannot<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.460> stand<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.940> because

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
here cannot really stand up because

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.130 
here cannot really stand up because
they're<00:00:42.450> being<00:00:42.600> held<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> place<00:00:43.230> by<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
they're being held in place by this

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
they're being held in place by this
other<00:00:46.140> row<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.710> rings<00:00:50.930> now<00:00:52.399> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> really

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
other row of rings now this is really

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.930 
other row of rings now this is really
easy<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> need<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.469> add<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:57.239> row<00:00:57.449> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
easy all you need to do is add a row of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:24.200 
easy all you need to do is add a row of
rings<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.780> through<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> scale

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:37.410 

I'm<00:01:25.210> using<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.570> fairly<00:01:26.050> hard<00:01:26.410> ring

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.490 

and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.880> we're<00:01:40.090> just<00:01:40.380> connecting<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:43.500> limbs

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
and then we're just connecting the limbs

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.790 
and then we're just connecting the limbs
that<00:01:44.650> we<00:01:44.890> have<00:01:45.510> added<00:01:46.979> along<00:01:47.979> with<00:01:49.680> catching<00:01:50.680> a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
that we have added along with catching a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.910 
that we have added along with catching a
split<00:01:51.100> ring<00:01:51.840> using<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.020> regular<00:01:53.500> sort<00:01:53.860> of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
split ring using a regular sort of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.950 
split ring using a regular sort of
European<00:01:54.460> form<00:01:55.180> one<00:01:55.360> pattern<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.810> loose

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
European form one pattern the loose

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:07.319 
European form one pattern the loose
value<00:01:56.380> three

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:26.430 

and<00:02:07.570> let's<00:02:07.810> close<00:02:08.170> this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600 

no<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.190> next<00:02:29.120> one<00:02:30.100> siding<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.370> ring

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
no to do next one siding the one ring

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.610 
no to do next one siding the one ring
through<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.270> scale<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.230> ring<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.530> you

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
through the scale and the ring that you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.130 
through the scale and the ring that you
adding<00:02:36.860> through<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> scale<00:02:37.990> exactly<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
adding through the scale exactly the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.350 
adding through the scale exactly the
same<00:02:39.350> as<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.520> you're<00:02:40.700> weaving<00:02:40.940> scale

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
same as is if you're weaving scale

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.230 
same as is if you're weaving scale
fabric<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.200> can<00:02:42.260> see<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.740> exactly<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:44.060> same

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
fabric you can see it's exactly the same

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.880 
fabric you can see it's exactly the same
is<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.170> split<00:02:45.350> right<00:02:45.500> left<00:02:45.709> my

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
is going is this split right left my

00:02:45.890 --> 00:03:01.570 
is going is this split right left my
trip

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.300 

and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.720> just<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.050> these<00:03:03.260> three<00:03:04.040> rings

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and then you just have these three rings

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.590 
and then you just have these three rings
all<00:03:04.580> set<00:03:05.540> up<00:03:06.730> exactly<00:03:07.730> as<00:03:07.940> they<00:03:08.150> would<00:03:08.330> appear

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
all set up exactly as they would appear

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:47.760 
all set up exactly as they would appear
in<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.440> piece<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.800> European<00:03:10.280> floor<00:03:10.490> one

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.860 

and<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.670> keep<00:03:49.150> on<00:03:49.360> all<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.320> way<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.710> row
