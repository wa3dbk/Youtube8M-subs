00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
memory of the Ford Explorer and there's
a<00:01:27.090> good<00:01:27.180> reason<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> Ford<00:01:28.350> has

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a good reason for that Ford has

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
a good reason for that Ford has
delivered<00:01:29.100> over<00:01:29.340> 7<00:01:29.970> million<00:01:30.450> Ford<00:01:30.869> Explorers

camera in the front here's how it looks

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.520 
camera in the front here's how it looks
on<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.700> inside<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.299> got<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> massive<00:03:48.840> myford

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
on the inside we got the massive myford

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.110 
on the inside we got the massive myford
screen<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:50.160> up<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.459> shows<00:03:50.970> you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
screen that's up here shows you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
screen that's up here shows you
everything<00:03:51.599> that's<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.810> front<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.079> the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
everything that's in front of the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.080 
everything that's in front of the
vehicle<00:03:52.290> you've<00:03:52.530> got<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> second<00:03:53.160> angle<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.030> you

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
vehicle you've got a second angle so you

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.670 
vehicle you've got a second angle so you
can<00:03:54.180> see<00:03:54.269> on<00:03:54.540> either<00:03:54.690> corner<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.349> vehicle

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
can see on either corner of the vehicle

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.080 
can see on either corner of the vehicle
and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.190> keeps<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:56.519> bit<00:03:56.670> safer<00:03:57.030> if

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and it just keeps a little bit safer if

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.009 
and it just keeps a little bit safer if
there's<00:03:57.239> anything<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.630> front<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.930> that's

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
there's anything in front of you that's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.960 
there's anything in front of you that's
moving<00:03:58.290> before<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.130> pull<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.940> make

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
moving before you pull out you can make

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.160 
moving before you pull out you can make
sure<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.360> see<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.840> don't<00:04:00.959> have<00:04:01.079> any
