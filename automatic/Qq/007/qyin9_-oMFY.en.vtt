00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.420
 asked people 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.650
 very click in principle I thought long 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.560
 in general how is it mandatory what is 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.780
 click that there are guys who have long 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.440
 they ride too understand me well chuk it 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.360
 Khinchuk 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:12.229
 yes, but if you try to disassemble it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:16.990
 click then basically there it goes well 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:22.759
 as well as if you were jumping from 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.810
 socks came so here roughly you 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.900
 when you stand that's why why here we are 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.910
 and we say well, maybe as many that 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.380
 bake agree that to click 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.600
 it is necessary to put the foot here nom nom nom and juice 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.690
 because but we jump from toe high 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.900
 we ca n't sleep x 5 buy everything 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.140
 one year from the bowl you can jump higher 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.540
 because the heel is but one rough 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.970
 the bone carrier on which you have weight 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.640
 bodies everything else and here here 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.700
 is as obviously is well 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.729
 a large number of small muscle joints 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.120
 and tendons so well he is more 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:13.430
 dynamic that's it well guys guys 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 Who was there at our training sessions 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.470
 and also remember that such a topic 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 transmitted, we recommend this 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.470
 exercise that is, we like it well 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.590
 the jump from the back foot is obtained because 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.160
 that the front leg goes up like 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 will 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.060
 and the back will have to click later 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.489
 then will will be done 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.010
 summing up such an exercise 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.360
 just like jumping back legs that is 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.610
 here you stand here you 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.570
 in a stroke of 100 stand here sit down here 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.240
 jumped out here click on thats all yes 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.680
