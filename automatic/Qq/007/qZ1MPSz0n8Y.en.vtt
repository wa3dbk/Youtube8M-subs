the<00:00:55.109> red<00:00:55.289> lines<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.619> like<00:00:55.739> 12<00:00:56.089> it<00:00:57.089> should<00:00:57.359> be<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
the red lines at like 12 it should be a

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.860 
the red lines at like 12 it should be a
six<00:00:57.719> meter<00:00:57.930> right

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.670 

I<00:01:03.930> mean<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.530> thing<00:01:04.680> gets<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.070> go

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.219 

that<00:01:15.220> quick<00:01:15.400> motherfucker

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.010 

considering<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.700> actually<00:01:20.570> really

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
considering what it is I actually really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.510 
considering what it is I actually really
like<00:01:21.200> it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
like it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.510 
like it
it<00:01:22.520> fits<00:01:23.149> comfortable<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:24.020> mean<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.399> only

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
it fits comfortable I mean it the only

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.950 
it fits comfortable I mean it the only
thing<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.240> don't<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.539> about<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:26.869> that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
thing is that I don't like about is that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.330 
thing is that I don't like about is that
it's<00:01:27.110> carbureted<00:01:27.710> that's<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.100> only<00:01:28.250> thing

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
it's carbureted that's the only thing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.490 
it's carbureted that's the only thing
that<00:01:28.460> sucks<00:01:28.610> about<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:29.990> even<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:30.320> this

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
that sucks about it but even then this

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.870 
that sucks about it but even then this
thing<00:01:30.710> works<00:01:30.890> really<00:01:31.070> well<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.610> apparently

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
thing works really well and apparently

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.330 
thing works really well and apparently
the<00:01:32.210> computers<00:01:32.860> like<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.950> fairly<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
the computers like a fairly the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.950 
the computers like a fairly the
computers<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.880> control<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.539> carburation

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
computers that control the carburation

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.749 
computers that control the carburation
on<00:01:36.259> this<00:01:36.380> bike<00:01:36.560> or<00:01:37.069> whatever<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:37.490> called<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
on this bike or whatever it's called the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.820 
on this bike or whatever it's called the
CDI<00:01:38.090> box<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:39.200> supposed<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.500> be<00:01:39.619> really<00:01:39.829> well

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.319 

I<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:44.400> we're<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.150> you
