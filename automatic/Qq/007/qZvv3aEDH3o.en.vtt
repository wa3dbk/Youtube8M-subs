this<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> lot<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.660> private<00:00:15.900> students<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this a lot with my private students and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.950 
this a lot with my private students and
I<00:00:17.460> think<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.880> really<00:00:18.060> useful<00:00:18.300> skill

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I think it's a really useful skill

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.470 
I think it's a really useful skill
because<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.430> gets<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:22.380> listen<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
because it gets you to really listen to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
because it gets you to really listen to
music<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> tones<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.470> differentiate

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
music and tones and differentiate

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.689 
music and tones and differentiate
pitches<00:00:26.849> high<00:00:27.180> low<00:00:27.720> rhythms<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.800> forth<00:00:29.070> so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
pitches high low rhythms and so forth so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.279 
pitches high low rhythms and so forth so
what<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.269> start<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.199> you're

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
what we first start off with when you're

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
what we first start off with when you're
playing<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.189> year<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.719> melody

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
playing something by year is the melody

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.700 
playing something by year is the melody
most<00:00:34.950> important<00:00:35.430> part<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> melody<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
most important part the melody and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
most important part the melody and
that's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> sequence<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.489> pitches<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.300> we

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that's a sequence of pitches and we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.280 
that's a sequence of pitches and we
would<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.870> off<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> song<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:42.290> kids

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
that has an emphasis right my you're so
you'd<00:03:38.340> write<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.700> words<00:03:38.940> down<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.600> then<00:03:39.900> you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
you'd write the words down and then you

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.170 
you'd write the words down and then you
would<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.620> circle<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> word<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.850> where<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
would just circle the word in where you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.130 
would just circle the word in where you
feel<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.780> there's<00:03:42.960> that<00:03:43.050> emphasis<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.750> next

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
feel that there's that emphasis the next

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.450 
feel that there's that emphasis the next
thing<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.800> figure<00:03:47.070> out<00:03:47.190> well<00:03:47.430> what

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
thing to do is to figure out well what

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.870 
thing to do is to figure out well what
are<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.970> chords<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.390> go<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.720> and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
are the chords that go with that and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.190 
are the chords that go with that and
that's<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.060> little<00:03:51.210> simpler<00:03:51.720> than<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.020> might

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
that's a little simpler than you might

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.320 
that's a little simpler than you might
imagine<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:53.010> are<00:03:53.060> there's<00:03:54.060> something

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
imagine there are there's something

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.370 
imagine there are there's something
called<00:03:54.480> primary<00:03:54.930> chords<00:03:55.710> in<00:03:55.920> every<00:03:56.610> key<00:03:56.880> so

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
called primary chords in every key so

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.490 
called primary chords in every key so
we're<00:03:58.460> we're<00:03:59.460> in<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.700> key<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.910> C<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.780> not

that<00:04:16.489> another<00:04:16.790> time<00:04:17.150> as<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.540> how<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.780> come<00:04:18.109> up

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
that another time as to how you come up

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.960 
that another time as to how you come up
with<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.530> primary<00:04:18.799> chords<00:04:19.250> but<00:04:19.669> when<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.940> are

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
with the primary chords but when you are

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.789 
with the primary chords but when you are
doing<00:04:20.359> some<00:04:20.810> figuring<00:04:20.959> out<00:04:21.260> songs<00:04:21.560> by<00:04:21.769> ear

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
doing some figuring out songs by ear

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.340 
doing some figuring out songs by ear
actually<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.669> would<00:04:23.120> start<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.720> key<00:04:23.900> at<00:04:24.020> sea

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
actually I would start in the key at sea

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.490 
actually I would start in the key at sea
anyway<00:04:25.389> which<00:04:26.389> means<00:04:26.780> sometimes<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.350> would

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
anyway which means sometimes you would

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800 
anyway which means sometimes you would
start<00:04:27.740> your<00:04:27.889> note<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.220> C<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.850> often<00:04:29.389> times<00:04:29.600> you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
start your note on C and often times you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.330 
start your note on C and often times you
would<00:04:29.900> start<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> G<00:04:30.979> below<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.580> sea<00:04:33.340> okay

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
would start it on a G below the sea okay

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.260 
would start it on a G below the sea okay
so<00:04:34.449> C<00:04:35.449> F<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.139> G<00:04:36.380> are<00:04:36.410> our<00:04:36.740> primary<00:04:37.100> chords<00:04:37.760> so

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so C F and G are our primary chords so

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.219 
so C F and G are our primary chords so
we<00:04:38.449> would<00:04:38.570> go<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:39.320> land<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.550> your<00:04:41.050> that's<00:04:42.050> our

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
we would go this land is your that's our

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.740 
we would go this land is your that's our
first<00:04:42.650> chord<00:04:43.370> right<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:45.770> have<00:04:45.950> an<00:04:46.100> F<00:04:46.310> there

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
first chord right and we have an F there

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.960 
first chord right and we have an F there
so<00:04:47.750> there's<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.410> good<00:04:48.620> chance<00:04:48.950> of<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.430> cord<00:04:49.790> is

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
so there's a good chance of the cord is

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.480 
so there's a good chance of the cord is
going<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.540> F<00:04:50.630> chord<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.139> there<00:04:52.040> what

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
going to be the F chord are there what

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.930 
going to be the F chord are there what
other<00:04:52.639> chords<00:04:53.180> we<00:04:53.330> have<00:04:53.510> C<00:04:53.870> F<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:55.220> G<00:04:55.790> and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
other chords we have C F and G and

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.600 
other chords we have C F and G and
usually<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.450> G<00:04:56.930> would<00:04:57.080> be<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.260> g7<00:04:57.830> someone<00:04:58.430> has

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
usually the G would be a g7 someone has

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.659 
usually the G would be a g7 someone has
an<00:04:58.760> F<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.660> it's<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.050> four<00:05:00.289> note<00:05:00.440> chord<00:05:00.800> so

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
an F in it so it's a four note chord so

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.060 
an F in it so it's a four note chord so
our<00:05:01.910> two<00:05:02.180> options<00:05:02.380> most<00:05:03.380> of<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.650> time<00:05:03.889> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
our two options most of the time the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.129 
our two options most of the time the
right-hand<00:05:04.550> melody<00:05:04.789> is<00:05:05.150> contained<00:05:05.720> in<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
right-hand melody is contained in the

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.150 
right-hand melody is contained in the
cord<00:05:06.560> so<00:05:07.449> what<00:05:08.449> chord<00:05:09.080> could<00:05:09.289> we<00:05:09.440> put<00:05:09.680> here<00:05:10.010> we

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
cord so what chord could we put here we

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.529 
cord so what chord could we put here we
could<00:05:10.370> put<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.510> F<00:05:12.050> chord<00:05:12.639> but<00:05:13.639> we<00:05:14.000> might<00:05:14.330> also

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
could put the F chord but we might also

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.700 
could put the F chord but we might also
try<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:15.200> g7<00:05:16.360> g7<00:05:17.360> has<00:05:17.510> an<00:05:17.660> F<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.410> land

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
try the g7 g7 has an F in it this land

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.090 
try the g7 g7 has an F in it this land
is

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
is

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.790 
is
and<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.760> sounds<00:05:21.150> awful<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.230> we<00:05:22.380> know<00:05:22.530> that's

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
and that sounds awful so we know that's

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.310 
and that sounds awful so we know that's
not<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:23.820> land<00:05:24.150> is<00:05:24.540> f<00:05:26.150> this<00:05:27.150> land<00:05:27.690> is<00:05:28.110> the

not it this land is f this land is the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.870 
not it this land is f this land is the

we do a C chord that's really not going
to<00:06:09.900> work<00:06:10.080> there's<00:06:10.350> no<00:06:10.530> D<00:06:10.800> in<00:06:10.950> a<00:06:11.040> C<00:06:11.280> chord<00:06:11.490> when

we do an F chord that's not going to

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.240 
we do an F chord that's not going to
work<00:06:15.030> but<00:06:15.570> there<00:06:15.750> is<00:06:15.780> a<00:06:15.930> d<00:06:16.200> in<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.440> g7<00:06:17.070> chord

work but there is a d in the g7 chord
and<00:06:17.460> I'm<00:06:17.760> inverting<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:18.390> in<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.510> left<00:06:18.660> hand

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
and I'm inverting it in the left hand

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.220 
and I'm inverting it in the left hand
just<00:06:19.110> could<00:06:19.350> make<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.620> easier<00:06:19.890> to<00:06:20.010> play<00:06:20.220> oh

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
just could make it easier to play oh

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.850 
just could make it easier to play oh
yeah<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:23.340> it<00:06:23.580> works<00:06:23.760> right<00:06:24.330> to<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.080> New<00:06:25.260> York

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
yeah and it works right to the New York
