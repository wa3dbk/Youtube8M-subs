right<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.609> show<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:05.819> some

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
right now I'm going to show you some

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.660 
right now I'm going to show you some
good<00:00:06.660> exercises<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.620> using<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.099> hang<00:00:08.400> board

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
good exercises for using a hang board

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.360 
good exercises for using a hang board
and<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.840> device<00:00:10.230> right<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
and this device right here is called a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.919 
and this device right here is called a
hang<00:00:11.550> board<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.240> can<00:00:12.360> kind<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> think<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.840> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
hang board you can kind of think of it

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.829 
hang board you can kind of think of it
as<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> glorified<00:00:13.769> pull-up<00:00:14.219> bar<00:00:14.400> almost

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
as a glorified pull-up bar almost

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.269 
as a glorified pull-up bar almost
basically<00:00:15.839> there's<00:00:16.080> different<00:00:16.560> positions<00:00:17.070> on

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
basically there's different positions on

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
basically there's different positions on
this<00:00:17.760> hang<00:00:17.970> board<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.660> allow<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
this hang board that allow you to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
this hang board that allow you to
isolate<00:00:19.470> different<00:00:19.949> grips<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.119> can

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
isolate different grips so you can

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.870 
isolate different grips so you can
practice<00:00:21.840> different<00:00:22.740> types<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.430> hand

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
practice different types of hand

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
practice different types of hand
positions<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> work<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.080> developing<00:00:25.250> what's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
positions and work on developing what's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.630 
positions and work on developing what's
known<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.609> contact<00:00:27.029> strength<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.519> when<00:00:29.519> you're

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
known as contact strength so when you're

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
known as contact strength so when you're
using<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.029> hang<00:00:30.240> board<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> exercises

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
using a hang board one of the exercises

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
using a hang board one of the exercises
is<00:00:32.369> simply<00:00:32.910> hanging<00:00:33.149> starting<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
is simply hanging starting with some of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
is simply hanging starting with some of
the<00:00:34.590> larger<00:00:35.010> spaces<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> hang<00:00:35.850> board<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the larger spaces on the hang board and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.220 
the larger spaces on the hang board and
then<00:00:37.910> hanging<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.329> continue<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
then hanging you can continue to do so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
then hanging you can continue to do so
moving<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> hang<00:00:44.489> board<00:00:44.760> getting<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
moving down the hang board getting to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
moving down the hang board getting to
smaller<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.020> smaller<00:00:46.260> positions<00:00:46.860> there's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
smaller and smaller positions there's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
smaller and smaller positions there's
many<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:47.820> types<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.300> hang<00:00:48.480> boards<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
many different types of hang boards that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
many different types of hang boards that
offer<00:00:49.200> different<00:00:49.890> shapes<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:50.640> sloping

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
offer different shapes from sloping

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
offer different shapes from sloping
holds<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> big<00:00:52.020> positive<00:00:52.559> holds<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.399> smaller

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
holds to big positive holds to smaller

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
holds to big positive holds to smaller
little<00:00:54.000> edges<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.629> called<00:00:54.899> crimps<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little edges that are called crimps so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
little edges that are called crimps so
moving<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.670> once<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> some<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
moving down once you get to some of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
moving down once you get to some of
these<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.289> technical<00:00:58.800> holds<00:00:59.190> once<00:00:59.969> again

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
these more technical holds once again

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
these more technical holds once again
you'll<00:01:00.660> practice<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> different<00:01:01.469> position

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you'll practice the different position

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.170 
you'll practice the different position
and<00:01:02.250> simply<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.750> comfortable<00:01:05.030> hanging<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and simply get comfortable hanging on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.830 
and simply get comfortable hanging on
them<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.939> great<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> start<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
them it's a great way to start to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
them it's a great way to start to
develop<00:01:10.080> contact<00:01:10.740> strength<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.250> also<00:01:11.820> kind

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
develop contact strength and also kind

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
develop contact strength and also kind
of<00:01:12.180> ease<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:12.810> using<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.409> tendons<00:01:13.860> by

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of ease into using your tendons by

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.590 
of ease into using your tendons by
putting<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.390> body

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
putting more and more of your body

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
putting more and more of your body
weight<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> smaller<00:01:16.799> surface<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:18.000> sort<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
weight on a smaller surface that sort of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
weight on a smaller surface that sort of
motion<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.380> hanging<00:01:19.619> without<00:01:19.890> pulling

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
motion of just hanging without pulling

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030 
motion of just hanging without pulling
is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.299> indicator<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.740> small

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is a good indicator of really how small

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
is a good indicator of really how small
of<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.310> hold<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.330> pulling<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.840> without

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of a hold you can be pulling on without

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
of a hold you can be pulling on without
risking<00:01:25.830> injury<00:01:26.600> once<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> comfortable

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
risking injury once you're comfortable

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
risking injury once you're comfortable
hanging<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> different

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hanging in some of the different

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.030 
hanging in some of the different
positions<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> start<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.840> incorporate

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
positions you can start to incorporate

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.789 
positions you can start to incorporate
more<00:01:32.040> movement<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:33.299> basically<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.560> doing

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
more movement by basically just doing

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
more movement by basically just doing
some<00:01:35.009> pull-ups<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> adding<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.630> sets<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
some pull-ups and adding some sets and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
some pull-ups and adding some sets and
some<00:01:37.409> routines<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.490> those

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
some routines to how you do those

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
some routines to how you do those
pull-ups<00:01:39.090> perhaps<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> larger<00:01:40.560> number

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pull-ups perhaps you do a larger number

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
pull-ups perhaps you do a larger number
of<00:01:40.829> pull-ups<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.700> bigger<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.180> positive

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of pull-ups on the bigger more positive

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
of pull-ups on the bigger more positive
holds<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.680> dropping<00:01:43.979> down<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.729> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
holds and then dropping down to some of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
holds and then dropping down to some of
the<00:01:44.909> smaller<00:01:45.180> sizes<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> reducing<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the smaller sizes and reducing the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.149 
the smaller sizes and reducing the
number<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.899> could<00:01:49.079> start<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.009> big

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
number so you could start on the big

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
number so you could start on the big
positive<00:01:50.399> holds<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.020> couple

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
positive holds maybe do a couple

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
positive holds maybe do a couple
pull-ups<00:01:53.009> however<00:01:53.310> many<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.700> comfortable

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
pull-ups however many you're comfortable

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
pull-ups however many you're comfortable
with<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.020> reduce<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.710> number<00:01:55.920> grab<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
with and then reduce that number grab a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.270 
with and then reduce that number grab a
smaller<00:01:56.939> hold<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.920> work<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.219> way

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
smaller hold and as you work your way

those by the time you get there and
