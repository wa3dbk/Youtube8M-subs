hello<00:00:00.210> children<00:00:00.630> let<00:00:00.870> learn<00:00:01.170> about<00:00:01.560> methods

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hello children let learn about methods

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.430 
hello children let learn about methods
of<00:00:02.370> food<00:00:02.580> preservation<00:00:02.899> there<00:00:03.899> are<00:00:04.049> various

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
of food preservation there are various

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.460 
of food preservation there are various
methods<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:05.100> food<00:00:05.310> preservation<00:00:05.810> one<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
methods of food preservation one of the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.330 
methods of food preservation one of the
method<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:09.650> adding<00:00:10.650> sugar<00:00:11.519> syrup<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
method is adding sugar syrup that is

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
method is adding sugar syrup that is
adding<00:00:14.340> sugar<00:00:16.910> syrup<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.210> add<00:00:18.420> sugar<00:00:18.449> syrup

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
adding sugar syrup we add sugar syrup

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.910 
adding sugar syrup we add sugar syrup
for<00:00:19.490> example<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.119> jam<00:00:23.060> jam<00:00:24.529> that<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> one

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
for example it is jam jam that is one

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
for example it is jam jam that is one
method<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.430> food<00:00:26.640> preservation<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.260> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
method of food preservation so here we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
method of food preservation so here we
have<00:00:28.800> jam<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> adding<00:00:30.869> sugar<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.969> helps

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
have jam that is adding sugar it helps

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.209 
have jam that is adding sugar it helps
you<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.480> preserve<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.309> in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> method<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
you to preserve and in the method is

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
you to preserve and in the method is
refrigeration<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> first

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
refrigeration so we go this is the first

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.380 
refrigeration so we go this is the first
method<00:00:40.710> another<00:00:41.520> method<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.140> refrigeration

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.520 

refrigeration<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> temperature<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> kept

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
refrigeration the temperature is kept

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.090 
refrigeration the temperature is kept
lowest<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.730> example<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.840> various<00:00:52.230> fruits

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
lowest for example the various fruits

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
lowest for example the various fruits
and<00:00:56.989> vegtables

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and vegtables

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
and vegtables
they<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.980> kept<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.809> refrigerators<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
they are kept in refrigerators so that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
they are kept in refrigerators so that
they<00:01:01.440> retain<00:01:01.770> their<00:01:02.039> color<00:01:02.280> and/or<00:01:03.080> nutrients

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
they retain their color and/or nutrients

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.850 
they retain their color and/or nutrients
for<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> longer<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.860> like

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
for the longer time so we have here like

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.060 
for the longer time so we have here like
you<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.970> frozen<00:01:09.600> peas<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you see here frozen peas they are for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.560 
you see here frozen peas they are for
refrigeration<00:01:12.740> third<00:01:13.740> method<00:01:14.570> for

layer

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
layer

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.950 
layer
right<00:01:59.510> so<00:02:00.510> we<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:01.080> here<00:02:02.660> juices

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
right so we have here juices

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.400 
right so we have here juices
I<00:02:06.230> hope<00:02:07.230> it's<00:02:07.440> working

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
I hope it's working

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.980 
I hope it's working
so<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.880> pack<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.910> Jews<00:02:13.490> right

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
so this is a pack of Jews right

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.500 
so this is a pack of Jews right
similarly<00:02:16.070> another<00:02:17.070> method<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.120> fourth

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
similarly another method the fourth

similarly another method the fourth
method<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:20.120> gaining<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> method<00:02:26.820> which

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
method is gaining this is a method which

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.510 
method is gaining this is a method which
is<00:02:27.570> normally<00:02:28.050> used<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.680> preservation<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
is normally used in preservation of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.910 
is normally used in preservation of
juices<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.900> learn<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.350> examples

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
juices you just learn the examples

put in again one more method for

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.710 
put in again one more method for
preservation<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.190> drying<00:02:44.190> under<00:02:44.820> Sun<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:46.290> is
