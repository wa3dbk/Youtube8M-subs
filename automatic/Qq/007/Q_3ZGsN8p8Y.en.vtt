00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.410 

my<00:00:01.390> rule<00:00:01.629> of<00:00:01.660> thumb<00:00:01.780> would<00:00:02.199> be<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.790> at<00:00:04.150> least

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:04.420 
my rule of thumb would be to at least

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.200 
my rule of thumb would be to at least
say<00:00:04.750> for<00:00:04.960> every<00:00:05.140> hour<00:00:05.500> of<00:00:05.529> my<00:00:05.890> list<00:00:06.460> of<00:00:06.640> contact

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
say for every hour of my list of contact

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.470 
say for every hour of my list of contact
I've<00:00:07.629> got<00:00:07.930> to<00:00:08.020> do<00:00:08.139> two<00:00:08.380> hours<00:00:08.559> of<00:00:08.679> work<00:00:08.920> outside

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
I've got to do two hours of work outside

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.480 
I've got to do two hours of work outside
so<00:00:10.480> my<00:00:10.660> 12<00:00:10.990> hours<00:00:11.230> of<00:00:11.440> contact<00:00:11.889> is<00:00:12.009> actually<00:00:12.309> a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
so my 12 hours of contact is actually a

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.509 
so my 12 hours of contact is actually a
36-hour<00:00:13.389> University<00:00:13.960> week<00:00:14.139> now<00:00:14.740> that's<00:00:15.250> going

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
36-hour University week now that's going

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.160 
36-hour University week now that's going
to<00:00:15.580> vary<00:00:15.610> from<00:00:15.969> student<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.450> student<00:00:16.540> some

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
to vary from student to student some

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.230 
to vary from student to student some
students<00:00:17.530> may<00:00:17.620> say<00:00:17.800> that's<00:00:17.980> too<00:00:18.130> much<00:00:18.340> others

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
students may say that's too much others

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.040 
students may say that's too much others
say<00:00:19.570> it's<00:00:19.690> not<00:00:19.900> enough<00:00:20.230> but<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:21.190> rule<00:00:21.550> of<00:00:21.580> thumb

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
say it's not enough but a rule of thumb

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470 
say it's not enough but a rule of thumb
at<00:00:23.050> university<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:24.130> find<00:00:24.790> that<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.300> will

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
at university you find that you will

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.270 
at university you find that you will
have<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.630> lot<00:00:25.810> of<00:00:25.840> time<00:00:26.050> to<00:00:26.170> yourself<00:00:26.500> and

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
have a lot of time to yourself and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.950 
have a lot of time to yourself and
you'll<00:00:27.670> have<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.120> decide<00:00:28.240> what<00:00:28.540> you<00:00:28.660> want<00:00:28.930> to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
you'll have to decide what you want to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.040 
you'll have to decide what you want to
do<00:00:29.110> at<00:00:29.290> that<00:00:29.320> time<00:00:29.760> I've<00:00:30.760> often<00:00:31.030> found<00:00:31.600> if<00:00:31.870> you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
do at that time I've often found if you

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.580 
do at that time I've often found if you
treat<00:00:32.710> University<00:00:33.220> like<00:00:33.430> a<00:00:33.460> job<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.960> you<00:00:35.440> can

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
treat University like a job then you can

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.120 
treat University like a job then you can
get<00:00:36.220> so<00:00:36.400> much<00:00:36.610> more<00:00:36.790> done<00:00:36.850> with<00:00:37.540> that<00:00:38.140> time<00:00:38.380> and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
get so much more done with that time and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.500 
get so much more done with that time and
it's<00:00:39.280> hard<00:00:39.430> it's<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.640> real<00:00:39.760> skill<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.090> learn<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
it's hard it's a real skill to learn to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's hard it's a real skill to learn to
be<00:00:40.660> able<00:00:40.990> to<00:00:41.080> make<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:41.470> make<00:00:41.770> best<00:00:42.010> use<00:00:42.100> at<00:00:42.370> a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
be able to make you make best use at a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.210 
be able to make you make best use at a
time<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:43.630> get<00:00:43.810> that<00:00:44.020> get<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.650> study<00:00:45.040> done

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
time and get that get that study done

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.010 
time and get that get that study done
it's<00:00:45.400> something<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:45.730> struggle<00:00:45.910> with<00:00:46.120> when<00:00:46.840> you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
it's something I struggle with when you

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.540 
it's something I struggle with when you
go<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.440> toots<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.010> don't<00:00:48.190> know<00:00:48.310> what

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
go to the toots and you don't know what

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.250 
go to the toots and you don't know what
people<00:00:49.000> are<00:00:49.210> talking<00:00:49.360> about<00:00:49.660> you<00:00:49.930> realize

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
people are talking about you realize

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.479 
people are talking about you realize
that<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.500> probably<00:00:50.710> have<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:50.980> do<00:00:51.220> a<00:00:51.250> bit<00:00:51.460> of

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
that you probably have to do a bit of

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.330 
that you probably have to do a bit of
work<00:00:51.610> outside<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:53.079> class<00:00:53.320> yourself<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.280> I

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
work outside of the class yourself and I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.520 
work outside of the class yourself and I
think<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.700> really<00:00:54.870> makes<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.020> big<00:00:56.050> difference

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
think it really makes a big difference

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.900 
think it really makes a big difference
you<00:00:56.710> can<00:00:56.770> really<00:00:57.040> tell<00:00:57.340> when<00:00:57.400> you've<00:00:57.730> done<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
you can really tell when you've done the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.840 
you can really tell when you've done the
reading<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:59.560> you<00:00:59.800> go<00:00:59.950> to<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.250> class<00:01:00.430> having

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
reading and you go to the class having

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.280 
reading and you go to the class having
done<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.149> reading<00:01:01.450> you<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.750> really<00:01:01.930> tell

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
done the reading you can really tell

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.100 
done the reading you can really tell
that<00:01:03.150> you<00:01:04.150> know<00:01:04.449> you're<00:01:04.659> on<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.900> ball<00:01:05.080> you

that you know you're on the ball you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.630 
that you know you're on the ball you
know<00:01:05.229> what's<00:01:05.530> going<00:01:05.860> on<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.250> makes<00:01:06.460> it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
know what's going on and it makes it

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.990 
know what's going on and it makes it
more<00:01:06.820> enjoyable<00:01:06.970> it's<00:01:07.930> not<00:01:08.430> 12<00:01:09.430> hours<00:01:09.760> and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
more enjoyable it's not 12 hours and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
that's all I have to do and this is a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's all I have to do and this is a
common<00:01:13.030> mistake<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.780> in<00:01:13.990> fact<00:01:14.200> one<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.409> them

common mistake and in fact one of them

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.350 
common mistake and in fact one of them

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
friends and I get to the library later

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.570 
friends and I get to the library later
well<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.990> reality<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> 12<00:01:26.979> hours<00:01:27.159> is<00:01:27.370> the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
well the reality is the 12 hours is the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.310 
well the reality is the 12 hours is the
tip<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.090> iceberg<00:01:28.120> we're<00:01:29.049> all<00:01:29.170> familiar

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
tip of the iceberg we're all familiar

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.020 
tip of the iceberg we're all familiar
with<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.710> iceberg<00:01:30.100> principle<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.820> there's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
with the iceberg principle that there's

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.940 
with the iceberg principle that there's
more<00:01:31.210> under<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.659> water<00:01:31.840> than<00:01:32.080> above<00:01:32.350> well

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
more under the water than above well

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.740 
more under the water than above well
University<00:01:33.580> study<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.000> very<00:01:34.210> much<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.510> same

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
University study is very much the same

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.469 
University study is very much the same
so<00:01:35.320> if<00:01:35.440> i<00:01:35.560> have<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.909> two-hour<00:01:36.909> lecture<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.420> a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
so if i have a two-hour lecture and a

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.359

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
as I'm not really good at reading so i

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:18.629
