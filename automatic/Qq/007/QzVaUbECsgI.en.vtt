00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good morning are very subscribers of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 youtube the truth is that I've had my 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.530
 video agenda to make this video 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 exclusively speaking only of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.279
 jonway ok guys first I love him 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.250
 explain why I'm doing this 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.490
 my video is because this video is 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 to answer all the questions 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm reading the questions here in 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.349
 youtube and in almost every video I 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.800
 are asking about the break before 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.080
 of for iphone 4s for iphone 5 and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 for the third generation a 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.210
 generation that we still do not have it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 available you follow me and follow me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.150
 asking where they are 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 find I follow you with the same 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.680
 answer and the answer is that still 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.800
 we do not have a break available for 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 these devices in the ios 6.0 mind 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 still and that's not something that I 'm going to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.980
 know when and the hackers themselves what 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.590
 They are responsible for making that your break 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.719
 they themselves do not know when they will have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.780
 that joey available because it's about 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 a lot of work they have to understand how 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 it works every time I support a game 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.850
 is every time already according to a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 update is to improve the team 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 but partly also to improve the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.170
 team on safety issues by 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.930
 that is we lose the germ then 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 every time a new version comes up as 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 is 5.1 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 but we lose the servei by followers 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 I always say until I do not let you know 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 can go up or not if the insurance go up or not 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.260
 for example right now if you have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 the iphone 4 iphone 3gs factor four 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.350
 generation if you can go up to 6.0 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.910
 I have video here of how to do the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.080
 jailbreak the only thing is that it is a york 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.110
 reiter 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.190
 yuri semin of the corresponding videos 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.440
 they will be in the description of this 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.880
 same video below the comments 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.840
 for you to see if you have a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.850
 iphone 4 an iphone 3gs or an invoice in 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.700
 the other case because they are different 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.729
 processors remember that the iphone 4s 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.030
 has a processor that is 5 is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.130
 different to the processor of the iphone 4 and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.709
 it was with three levels so that we 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.690
 leads to each device having 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 different function why you guys 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.400
 they see that like when we did the jove for 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.200
 iphone 4s we did not do it in the kingno but 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.570
 that we made an accident was a new 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.970
 method that's why it's going to be the same for the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.489
 frightened written great action are not the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.260
 same methods they take time 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
 investigating and finding 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.310
 vulnerabilities now yes we are going to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.370
 Martian font you can find the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.110
 last news about the jockey and I 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.440
 I assure that since we have a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.260
 jailbreak we will have it available in 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.390
 Martian background in the news part 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.790
 we upload a news where we talk about 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 how this character that I have here this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.630
 this character that is here was the one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.549
 did the jailbreak and that was a yorbis 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.739
 super super easy that could be done 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.260
 from the same device entering 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.970
 a page from breivik dotcom and it 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.459
 could do but it was had stopped 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.850
 work for young people and he had gone 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.860
 I supported but now return to me 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.440
 only thing is that I do not think he's going to go back 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.410
 for the jailbreak community but that 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.310
 I think he's going to concentrate now on his 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.230
 university you know they have 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.450
 study then I think what's going 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.100
 to do is that we can not expect a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.230
 young man that comes from him that are the 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.360
 Friday and super easy works for 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.920
 and he just stopped working as two 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.379
 weeks ago we informed you 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.290
 another thing is that I upload a video 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.810
 telling them of the greater iphone 5 that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.170
 it was always an ugly jailbreak that wants 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.180
 say it's a jailbreak but still 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.360
 united us king who is ready his king who 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 you need a force of destiny ' is 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.989
 a whole process that takes time 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.269
 then it is the jebir is still not 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.040

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.590

 question specifically because of 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.830
