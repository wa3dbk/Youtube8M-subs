00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.389 
go frozen that's okay too the only
important<00:01:56.169> part<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:56.799> squeeze<00:01:57.099> them

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
important part is that you squeeze them

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.969 
important part is that you squeeze them
out<00:01:58.179> of<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.479> water<00:01:58.630> very<00:01:59.169> very<00:01:59.409> well<00:01:59.649> so<00:01:59.919> you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
out of the water very very well so you

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.440 
out of the water very very well so you
need<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.219> be<00:02:00.340> really<00:02:00.639> you<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.299> that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
need to be really you have to do that

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.229 
need to be really you have to do that
absolutely<00:02:01.719> absolutely<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.829> once<00:02:03.489> you<00:02:03.669> have

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
absolutely absolutely so once you have

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.209 
absolutely absolutely so once you have
that<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.959> can<00:02:04.989> either<00:02:05.349> chop<00:02:05.709> them<00:02:05.889> by<00:02:06.009> hand

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
that you can either chop them by hand

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.359 
that you can either chop them by hand
otherwise<00:02:06.700> make<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.179> easy<00:02:07.329> rowboat<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.369> then

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
otherwise make it easy rowboat and then

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.919 
otherwise make it easy rowboat and then
you're<00:02:09.580> done<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.060> once<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.569> these<00:02:10.720> we're

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
you're done so once we have these we're

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.100
