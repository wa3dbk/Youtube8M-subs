reload the printer list every 10 minutes

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.240 
reload the printer list every 10 minutes
so<00:06:32.760> it's<00:06:32.940> always<00:06:33.330> fresh<00:06:34.110> and<00:06:34.440> if<00:06:34.830> there<00:06:35.010> was<00:06:35.190> a

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
so it's always fresh and if there was a

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.980 
so it's always fresh and if there was a
printer<00:06:35.669> dropped<00:06:36.150> within<00:06:36.479> this<00:06:36.750> 10<00:06:36.960> minute

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
printer dropped within this 10 minute

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.060 
printer dropped within this 10 minute
then<00:06:37.410> it's<00:06:37.530> going<00:06:37.650> to<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:37.860> quickly<00:06:38.070> effort

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
then it's going to be quickly effort

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.940 
then it's going to be quickly effort
so<00:06:41.070> this<00:06:41.970> is<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.600> crash<00:06:43.050> course<00:06:43.440> in<00:06:43.680> how<00:06:43.710> to

so this is the crash course in how to

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.670 
so this is the crash course in how to
