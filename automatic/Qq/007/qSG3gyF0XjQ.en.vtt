00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:12.416
 [Tim Hawkingson: Family Portrait] 

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.055
 The first piece you saw when you walked into this space 

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.477
 Is a railroad traffic light 

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.700
 I can drop it down for you to see. 

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.540
 [Interviewer] Oh, that’s really awkward. 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.277
 [Hawkingson] come to action shot 

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:31.510
 [Interviewer] is great 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.815
 [Hawkingson] I am going to get the key 

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.078
 Can I take the key? 

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.992
 Ok, come on. 

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.889
 and so 

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.340
 This is a Fresnel lens 

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:52.247
 It is the same mold that I used in the hippocampus. 

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.140
 And lens activity sculptures are also 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.942
 Its name is "double Dutch cake" 

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:03.110
 The names of all the works in the exhibition are taken from the names of the girl scouts. 

00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:07.448
 Some are cookies that have been retired. 

00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:08.571
 Some are even more embarrassing 

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.943
 We may be more familiar with some 

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:12.278
 Samoa 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.077
 Kukaboa, I think 

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.139
 But no mint pizza 

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.972
 No one is suitable for mint pizza 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.081
 My daughter Claire is a young boy scout 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.909
 She was doing sales a few months ago. 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.647
 Selling mint pizza from door to door 

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:43.416
 Follower biscuits, etc. 

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:46.109
 My favorite is Samoa. 

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:50.216
 I won't stick my tongue, I just finished drinking coffee. 

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:51.879
 [laugh] 

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:54.879
 I think I was doing bronze statues at the time. 

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.448
 Sticking out the tongue 

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.804
 Sticking your tongue conveys a very aggressive emotion 

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:06.016
 It’s like the shouting on the battlefield in Samoa. 

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.543
 I think it might be a candidate name. 

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.602
 Then I started to notice the names of other girl scout biscuits. 

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.278
 Can name other works 

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:18.006
 Some are almost as good as expected 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.803
 Some of the works in the exhibition were completed by me and Claire for a while. 

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.941
 She can say that gave me inspiration 

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:34.418
 Someone collided with me thinking 

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:37.143
 Get different perspectives at the same time 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.448
 She appeared in a different disguise 

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:54.542
 Maybe there is a little in the foot 

00:02:55.016 --> 00:03:01.083
 It wears a friendship anklet made of wire 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.817
 If she didn't make a friendship chain for me and her friends. 

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.816
 I should not put it in the work. 

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.939
 That is Claire's bicycle. 

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.510
 She learned to ride without the auxiliary wheels. 

00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:17.110
 When she no longer uses this car 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.909
 I got her consent and unloaded it. 

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:20.678
 [laugh] 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.822
 She should get used to what I used to be useless at home. 

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:27.815
 Give a second life 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.141
 These sheets that make up this hippocampus 

00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.878
 Scale 

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:41.571
 I want to use the imprint of different parts of my body. 

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:42.880
 Come as the scales of the hippocampus 

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:45.571
 So, these are the fingers below. 

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:47.141
 Up, is the fingerprint 

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:50.169
 Eye is navel 

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:56.111
 This horn-like structure is my mouth. 

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.848
 Doing a kiss 

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:03.015
 See more clearly in the body of the bubble 

00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:06.141
 You can see different skin textures 

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:08.816
 The biggest one is my head. 

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.171
 Two skulls, joined together 

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:15.615
 This hippocampus is made of polyester resin. 

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:19.171
 The same material that I used to cover that animal work 

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.973
 "Animal Treasure" 

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:26.016
 This is an activity sculpture 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.078
 Each cub is balanced on the next tooth 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.508
 The heartbeat of a baby can fall within five seconds 

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:40.247
 When he is embraced in the arms of his mother or grandmother 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.816
 It has a very relaxed posture inside 

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:56.448
 This series of works began to be closer to my family. 

00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:57.972
 Especially my parents 

00:04:57.972 --> 00:05:00.773
 If we talk about some personal things now, 

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:04.217
 I can say that I am in this space and feel very painful. 

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:07.677
 Because my mother is dying at this time. 

00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:10.141
 You know, I think a lot about 

00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:12.575
 About family relations 

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:14.143
 And accept 

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.016
 So it has a kind of acceptance inside 

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:22.425
 Every individual gives it the trust of the previous generation
