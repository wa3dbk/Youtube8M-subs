00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.870
 Can a VAZ dozen equipped 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.059
 same vazovskim motor on equal terms 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.269
 compete for a quarter mile chevrolet 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.930
 camaro which has 10 liters under the hood 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.579
 nitrous oxide engine and injection system 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.040
 it turns out maybe if this ten 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.869
 teams of onions jew himself how come 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.970
 that lukoil began to participate in the dredge 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.550
 because it is generally a ring team but 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.680
 when the super tourist closed in 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.989
 team has two cars left 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.820
 super dozens of which turned out to be in general 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.519
 nobody needs from one they did 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.179
 show car second gave plot drag 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.510
 racing a 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:43.550
 which is built into this rotary machine 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.339
 the engine of you in time did such 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 motors and it turned out that for racing 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.120
 VAZ rotary engine fits much 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.550
 better than a mazda rotary engine 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.260
 really some parts of Moscow 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.690
 motor still present in this 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.570
 engine but nonetheless the basis is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.999
 VAZ block what happened 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 about 400 horsepower 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.020
 if you use a nitrous injection system 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 nitrogen 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.979
 engine rearranged back and done 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 rear wheel drive car that general 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.549
 much better for drag racing however 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.619
 Soon the guys had to 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.170
 move the engine back forward because 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.689
 that simply there were no rivals in this 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.340
 class and now this car is again 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.590
 front wheel drive guys not 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 discouraged because if necessary 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.570
 all mounting positions are at the back and left on 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.310
 location so just transfer 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.979
 the engine is back no 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.350
 difficulties gearbox natural 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.659
 Cam French Gardens Firm 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.729
 Naturally nitrous oxide injection system 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.770
 And now Alexey, who probably is unlikely 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.500
 ever thought his super ten 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.710
 which at the end won now will 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.289
 rush in a straight line at 400 meters 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 nonetheless this is another very 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.690
 wonderful nice perfectly possible 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.240
 say project 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.760
 lukoil racing because they proved 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 that itâ€™s not just money 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
 huge engine volume 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 if you attach to all the head and skillful 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.340
 hands can be made for very small 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.320
 money is a very interesting unexpected thing 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
 yet again i will remind it 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.210
 Domestic ten with domestic 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
 powered by another such fun bonus 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.570
 the fact that the engine had to 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 set back and then rearrange 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.850
 Forward it turned out the ability to install 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.040
 two dates he's their engines because 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.990
 nothing hinders left leaving this 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.150
 motor ahead back put exactly 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.090
 the same synchronize the work of the boxes 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.430
 gears and please you get almost 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.680
 1000 strong all-wheel drive car 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.480
 weighing seven hundred and ninety pounds here 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.440
 then this car is definitely nobody 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.960
 catch up the truth while this project remains 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.310
 only by project why because in 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.600
 Russia is simply no blood 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.120
 infinite class 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.090
 but without two engines this car goes 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.050
 so breathtaking sound one 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.850
 engine noise so in general people 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.850
 you have to plug your ears 130 decibels 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.390
 and since the car is now 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.069
 front wheel drive front mounted 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.530
 special drago slicks they 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.660
 enough soft pressure is done 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.459
 small for better grip visible 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.280
 even as they climb a little 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.050
 start the rear wheels are narrow pumped up 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.630
 quite high pressure just for 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.730
 to make it easier to roll in order 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.380
 to accelerate faster you need to have with 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.690
 one side powerful motor on the other 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.250
 hand as little as possible because 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.170
 that acceleration is directly proportional to force 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.060
 applied to the body during acceleration and 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.130
 inversely proportional to the mass in order 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.900
 to make the car as easy as possible from 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.329
 it was removed everything that was possible 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.590
 remove many panels naturally 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.780
 fiberglass also replaced with glass 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.670
 replaced by polycarbonate it is very light 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 and at the same time quite durable 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 it turned out seven hundred and ninety kilograms 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.620
 this is not a big indicator at all 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.510
 because for example more powerful 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.430
 cars but also bigger with 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.060
 huge motors usually weighs 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.520
 a ton and more and this alone gives here 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.419
 This super here is pretty noticeable 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.789
 advantage 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.840
 definition we do not know indicators 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.930
 this car and the times when it was 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 rear wheel drive but 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.260
 front wheel drive measurements were taken and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.150
 that's what happened overclocking to 100 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.639
 kilometers per hour place three point 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.650
 fifty four hundredths of a second to 200 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.780
 kilometers per hour place 10 point 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.680
 eighty four hundredths of a second and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.889
 the best result at a distance of 402 meters 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.800
 for a quarter mile the net time is 11 integers 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.830
 thirty five hundredths of a second speed on 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.639
 finish more than two hundred kilometers per hour 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.979
 what are the results 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.560
 2007 when this car started 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.419
 compete in and 6 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.639
 Serious competition first four 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.300
 places one gathering on technology one second 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:21.150
 place 2008 of nine serious races 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.070
 8 wins and one third place including 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.950
 first place in the cup competition 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.100
 Moscow 2008 3rd place at the Grand Prix 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.200
 Moscow 2000 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.670
 very conquered the title of champions of russia 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.670
 drag racing in the class of pro and
