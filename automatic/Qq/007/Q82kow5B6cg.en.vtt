00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
do think that this works really well on

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
do think that this works really well on
the<00:00:52.020> phone<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.430> everything

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the phone because you can get everything

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
the phone because you can get everything
in<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.840> place<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> things<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> use

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
in one place all the things that you use

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
in one place all the things that you use
and<00:00:57.020> my<00:00:58.020> only<00:00:58.170> problem<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.129> i

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
and my only problem of this is that i

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
and my only problem of this is that i
don't<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> box<00:01:00.359> style

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
don't know how to do the box style

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
don't know how to do the box style
there's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> folder<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.210> here

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there's a like a folder so like here

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
there's a like a folder so like here
there's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> music<00:01:04.350> video<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.339> i<00:01:05.430> press<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
there's a music video and if i press the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
there's a music video and if i press the
music<00:01:06.270> video<00:01:06.540> button<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.049> opens<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
music video button it opens up into a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.390 
music video button it opens up into a
separate<00:01:08.610> screen<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.799> I've<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.979> figured<00:01:11.310> out

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
separate screen and I've not figured out

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
separate screen and I've not figured out
how<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> phone<00:01:12.360> yet<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
how to do that on this phone yet I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
how to do that on this phone yet I
should<00:01:13.380> probably<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> instruction

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
should probably look at the instruction

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.330 
should probably look at the instruction
manual<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.090> might<00:01:15.210> tell<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.340> but

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
manual because it might tell me and but

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.289 
manual because it might tell me and but
if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.420> could<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> really

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
if I could do that then that is a really

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.440 
if I could do that then that is a really
effective<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.159> phone<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:24.000> with

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
effective way of using the phone as with

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
effective way of using the phone as with
most<00:01:24.750> phones<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
most phones and when you have a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429 
most phones and when you have a
notification<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.479> tells<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.320> app

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
notification it tells you on the app

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
notification it tells you on the app
itself<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.130> I've<00:01:29.400> currently<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.939> message

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
itself so I've currently got a message

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
itself so I've currently got a message
on<00:01:30.750> facebook<00:01:30.960> Messenger<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.640> who

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
on facebook Messenger I don't know who

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.480 
on facebook Messenger I don't know who
that<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.000> m<00:01:33.479> from<00:01:33.900> I've<00:01:34.740> probably<00:01:35.009> read<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that is m from I've probably read it on

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.870 
that is m from I've probably read it on
a<00:01:35.520> different<00:01:35.970> device<00:01:36.920> no<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> haven't<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.759> read

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
a different device no I haven't not read

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
a different device no I haven't not read
that<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.470> sometimes<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.860> phone

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that one and sometimes this phone

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.660 
that one and sometimes this phone
doesn't<00:01:41.340> catch<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.970> you've<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:43.670> different

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

a good camera on a phone then this is

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
really annoyed me was the fact that this

first<00:04:57.750> started<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.620> have<00:04:58.710> more<00:04:58.950> apps

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
can sometimes change things so if you

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.230 
can sometimes change things so if you
try<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.380> write<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.590> hashtag<00:05:26.280> for<00:05:26.640> twitter<00:05:26.970> or

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.030 
try to write a hashtag for twitter or
instagram<00:05:27.420> if<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.380> two<00:05:28.560> words<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.950> will

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
instagram if it's two words it will

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.000 
instagram if it's two words it will
sometimes<00:05:29.430> split<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.850> words<00:05:30.030> in<00:05:30.240> half<00:05:30.390> and

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
sometimes split the words in half and

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.560 
sometimes split the words in half and
which<00:05:32.010> isn't<00:05:32.490> really<00:05:32.670> useful<00:05:33.300> when<00:05:33.480> you're

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
which isn't really useful when you're

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.080

trying<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.870> hashtag<00:05:34.530> things<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.670> have<00:05:35.970> to

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
trying to hashtag things so you have to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.180 
trying to hashtag things so you have to
be<00:05:36.120> careful<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.780> check<00:05:37.260> back<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.830> make<00:05:38.160> sure

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
be careful to check back and make sure

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.770 
be careful to check back and make sure
that<00:05:38.370> it's<00:05:38.760> not<00:05:38.850> done<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.060> which<00:05:39.480> again<00:05:39.720> is

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
that it's not done that which again is

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.930 
that it's not done that which again is
another<00:05:40.050> minor<00:05:40.440> problem<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.580> long<00:05:41.730> as

another minor problem and as long as

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.150 
another minor problem and as long as
you're<00:05:42.090> vigilant<00:05:42.540> it's<00:05:42.720> nothing<00:05:43.320> that's<00:05:43.890> too

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
you're vigilant it's nothing that's too

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.950 
you're vigilant it's nothing that's too
serious<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.850> you<00:05:44.940> can<00:05:45.180> solve<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:45.750> quite

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
serious and you can solve it quite

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.810 
serious and you can solve it quite
easily<00:05:46.140> although<00:05:46.770> I<00:05:46.800> have<00:05:47.100> had<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.430> delete<00:05:47.670> a

easily although I have had to delete a

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.100 
easily although I have had to delete a
couple<00:05:48.090> of<00:05:48.150> tweets<00:05:48.360> because<00:05:48.570> it's<00:05:48.750> done<00:05:48.900> that

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110
