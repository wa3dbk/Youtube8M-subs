yes<00:04:06.389> but<00:04:06.870> crucial<00:04:07.549> healers<00:04:08.549> will<00:04:08.970> get

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
yes but crucial healers will get

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030 
yes but crucial healers will get
tormented<00:04:09.660> at<00:04:09.780> some<00:04:09.959> point<00:04:10.199> decreasing<00:04:10.919> their

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
tormented at some point decreasing their

tormented at some point decreasing their
healing<00:04:11.220> by<00:04:11.430> 50%<00:04:12.290> usually<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.409> because<00:04:13.470> they

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
healing by 50% usually it's because they

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.619 
healing by 50% usually it's because they
get<00:04:13.889> countdown<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.669> sometimes<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.480> because

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
get countdown but sometimes it's because

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.719 
get countdown but sometimes it's because
someone<00:04:16.169> runs<00:04:16.349> by<00:04:16.500> them<00:04:16.739> with<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.039> or<00:04:17.220> they're

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
someone runs by them with it or they're

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.819 
someone runs by them with it or they're
in<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.880> bad<00:04:18.000> spot<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:19.260> need<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.560> try<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
in a bad spot you need to try to

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.500 
in a bad spot you need to try to
minimize<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.370> by<00:04:20.549> having<00:04:20.699> set<00:04:21.060> places<00:04:21.419> in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
minimize this by having set places in

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.540 
minimize this by having set places in
the<00:04:21.570> range<00:04:21.780> camp<00:04:22.109> for<00:04:22.260> healers<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:23.370> should

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
the range camp for healers you should

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.159 
the range camp for healers you should
keep<00:04:23.729> movement<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> minimum<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.960> fight

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
keep movement to a minimum in this fight

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.719 
keep movement to a minimum in this fight
so<00:04:25.470> when<00:04:25.560> people<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.949> countdown<00:04:26.370> they<00:04:26.580> can

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
so when people have countdown they can

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.300 
so when people have countdown they can
leave<00:04:26.909> a<00:04:26.940> path<00:04:27.210> through<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:28.710> sounds

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
leave a path through you it sounds

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.250 
leave a path through you it sounds
extremely<00:04:29.669> complicated<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.750> important

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
extremely complicated but the important

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.839 
extremely complicated but the important
thing<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.650> always<00:04:31.830> have<00:04:32.430> pallies

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
thing is to always have pallies

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.210 
thing is to always have pallies
industries<00:04:33.419> on<00:04:33.599> tanks<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.289> therefore<00:04:35.070> they

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
industries on tanks and therefore they

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.219 
industries on tanks and therefore they
need<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.460> build<00:04:35.969> up<00:04:36.060> their<00:04:36.210> stacks<00:04:36.450> as<00:04:36.630> fast<00:04:37.020> as

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
need to build up their stacks as fast as

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.140 
need to build up their stacks as fast as
possible<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:38.430> must<00:04:38.789> have<00:04:38.969> good

separate channels for this fight since
there<00:04:47.159> was<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.430> much<00:04:47.550> need<00:04:47.969> for<00:04:48.000> communication

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479
