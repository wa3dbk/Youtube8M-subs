00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 Skateboarding was probably originally 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.170
 just an interesting pastime 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.820
 on air 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.650
 but after a few decades he 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.700
 turned into a completely new sport 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.700
 skating on the board 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 the professionals will do great 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 pirouettes air reaches such 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 speeds and heights about which earlier 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.820
 skateboarders didn't even dream in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.710
 thirties last century thirsty 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.860
 thrills children began to attach 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 rolls to wooden boxes they don't 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.649
 knew that one day it would carry the whole world 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.629
 fifty-eighth year boxing and 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.879
 turned into planks when the group 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.710
 Californian surfers invented a surfer 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.210
 on the sidewalk is not what 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 to have fun in bad weather 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.940
 preventing them from riding the waves they 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.899
 attached rollers to wooden planks and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 then rolled through the streets very soon 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.780
 others are interested in this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.780
 and hobby has become worldwide 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.150
 soundboard part of a skateboard on which stand 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.320
 made of several thin layers 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.940
 plywood wood in a cheap mess 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.990
 uses less layers and less 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 quality wood 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.390
 And these with excellent trim on the ends consist 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.270
 of seven high quality maple sheets 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.460
 only upper and lower plywood are visible 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.560
 sheets therefore their exterior surfaces 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.070
 polished smoothly on the other side 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.290
 a layer of glue is applied to the inner glands 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 you sprinkle bread on both sides 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.110
 this is a special glue capable 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 withstand vibration and shock worker 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.720
 put on a rack 35 sheets of plywood that 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.950
 equivalent to 5 wild skateboards and 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.900
 put them in a mold skateboards 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.850
 differ in size and shape therefore 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.390
 for each model there is a separate 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.860
 Press form 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.260
 the press puts pressure at 40 tons 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.830
 squeezing curving sheet and accordingly 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:15.970
 the mold excess glue runs off the sides 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.060
 forming from December 5 a single whole later them 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.440
 share after three hours the block is taken out 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.080
 now it drills two sets 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.360
 the holes on them will install the front 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.440
 rear tracks rotating 8 allowing 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.440
 skateboard rotate 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.319
 now it's time to give a rectangular block 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.540
 The shape of the skateboard pattern is chosen in 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.840
 according to common configuration 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.819
 we make models from below is available 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.560
 pins that are gently attached in 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.660
 newly drilled holes ah for 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.220
 suspensions this keeps the pattern in 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.110
 stillness while they do what 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.250
 called rough pruning that is 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.019
 prune around it 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.440
 leaving a strip of two and a half 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.170
 a centimeter when cutting off excess 5 dec 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.540
 now each is divided individually 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 give shape this time thanks 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.849
 accurate pattern and frieze 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.799
 dk takes a finished look now with 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.000
 using a special cutter round out 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.000
 top and bottom edges 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.480
 then on a drum grinding machine 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.480
 grinds all surfaces 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.549
 followed by a polishing machine in 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.230
 which uses a set of brushes and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:47.260
 skins to remove all coarse fibers 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.260
 wood now the board is completely smooth 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.769
 then comes the turn of the finishing cycle 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.930
 processing 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.480
 where workers spray colorless decks 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.000
 primer thus closes the pores 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 plywood and a layer of varnish which I then 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.900
 will cover is not absorbed 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.480
 primer dries 2 hours 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.240
 then spray a layer of transparent or 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:27.670
 colored varnish is obtained very protective 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.050
 shiny final varnish 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.050
 also dries within 2 hours 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.580
 the final stage of the finishing process 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.770
 is decorating bold 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.110
 bright drawings printed on plastic 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 sheets skateboard factory 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.070
 or buys them ready or produces 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.070
 in their stencil us equipment 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.610
 the worker is placed in the center of the sheet with 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.290
 pattern then skip the board between 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.410
 machine rollers which simultaneously 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.389
 heats and presses the sheet 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.220
 200 degrees Celsius causes chemical 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.460
 the reaction which resulted in paint and 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.150
 varnish mixed when plastic is removed 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.150
 board ready 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.790
 skateboards of this size are sold in 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.390
 unassembled in specialized 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.850
 stores 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.740
 they are intended for serious raiders 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.310
 who want to bring the final 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.110
 customization they seek and choose 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.480
 what they need from different types of tracks 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.480
 roller bearings even bolts which 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.070
 all fasten all these factors determine 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.690
 how fast or how bizarre 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.260
 will roll and maneuver them 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.260
 skateboard
