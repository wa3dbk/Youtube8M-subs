will take it out and give you a glimpse
of<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.770 

oh<00:00:46.340> boy<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:49.370> flew<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> when<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> went<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> old<00:00:51.480> era

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
oh boy I flew it when I went to old era

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
oh boy I flew it when I went to old era
when<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> visited<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> factory<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.340> flew<00:00:53.910> it

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
when I visited the factory I flew it

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
when I visited the factory I flew it
together<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.559> impressed

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
together with them and I was impressed

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
together with them and I was impressed
not<00:00:56.730> only<00:00:57.059> by<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> looks<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.469> way

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
not only by the looks but also the way

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.450 
not only by the looks but also the way
it<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.039> behaving<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.149> perform<00:01:01.460> well

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it was behaving and the way perform well

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
it was behaving and the way perform well
it<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> three<00:01:03.359> axis<00:01:03.539> sterilization<00:01:04.530> system

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it has a three axis sterilization system

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
it has a three axis sterilization system
with<00:01:04.979> three<00:01:05.129> axis<00:01:05.430> gyro<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.479> its<00:01:06.659> own

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
with three axis gyro it has its own

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
with three axis gyro it has its own
independent<00:01:07.340> stabilization<00:01:08.340> system<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
independent stabilization system so this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
independent stabilization system so this
bird<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:09.840> very<00:01:10.409> stable

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
bird is very very stable

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
bird is very very stable
I<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:12.150> even<00:01:12.330> flown<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.470> windy<00:01:13.740> day<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I have even flown it on a windy day that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
I have even flown it on a windy day that
they<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.850> tested<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:15.869> windy

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
they will be tested it it was very windy

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
they will be tested it it was very windy
and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:17.070> flew<00:01:17.400> awesome<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.270> by<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> looks<00:01:19.470> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and it flew awesome and by the looks we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
and it flew awesome and by the looks we
can<00:01:19.950> say<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.880> else<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.830> have

can say what else do you want we have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.149 
can say what else do you want we have
three<00:01:23.400> blades<00:01:23.840> okay<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:26.009> three

on<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:54.140> sterilization<00:01:55.140> system<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.770> okay

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
on your sterilization system here okay

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
on your sterilization system here okay
this<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.869> comes<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> radio<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.189> on

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
this one comes with the radio it's on

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.359 
this one comes with the radio it's on
2.40<00:02:00.180> transmitter<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.830> all

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
2.40 transmitter but because of all

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
2.40 transmitter but because of all
clear<00:02:02.580> at<00:02:02.670> centimeter<00:02:03.210> offers<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.930> 140<00:02:04.290> do

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
clear at centimeter offers me 140 do

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.399 
clear at centimeter offers me 140 do
five<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.789> more<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.240> 200<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.170> sent

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
five and this more at 200 so they sent

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919 
five and this more at 200 so they sent
the<00:02:07.440> only<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:08.009> transmitter<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:09.300> request

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the only one transmitter on my request

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.050 
the only one transmitter on my request
actually<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.100> good<00:02:11.280> thing<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.489> more<00:02:11.850> pure

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
actually the good thing about more pure

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940 
actually the good thing about more pure
transmitters<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.709> are<00:02:13.830> very

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
transmitters is that if they are very

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.240 
transmitters is that if they are very
easy<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.370> use<00:02:14.880> very<00:02:15.540> easy<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.380> copy<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
easy to use very easy to copy the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
easy to use very easy to copy the
settings<00:02:17.489> even<00:02:18.060> between<00:02:18.330> transmitters<00:02:19.050> will

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
settings even between transmitters will

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.199 
settings even between transmitters will

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
take it out and we'll see how it will

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.599 
take it out and we'll see how it will
behave<00:03:18.120> outside<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.799> we<00:03:19.829> are<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.959> 20<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> yes

Walcheren<00:03:27.000> has<00:03:27.299> improved<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.989> lot<00:03:28.019> over<00:03:28.560> these

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
Walcheren has improved a lot over these

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.660 
Walcheren has improved a lot over these
years<00:03:30.290> let's<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.530> how<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.920> helicopter<00:03:32.340> will

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
years let's see how this helicopter will

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
years let's see how this helicopter will
behave<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.060> my<00:03:33.359> hands<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.290> here

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
behave in my hands now that it's here

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.740 
behave in my hands now that it's here
this<00:03:35.280> means<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:35.970> many<00:03:36.120> many<00:03:36.359> flights

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
this means we can do many many flights

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.099 
this means we can do many many flights
so<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.859> can<00:03:38.069> mount<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:39.239> battery<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:39.870> with<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
so we can mount the battery here with a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.880 
so we can mount the battery here with a
strap<00:03:40.440> brushless<00:03:41.010> motors<00:03:41.549> inside<00:03:42.890> the

helicopter main rotor is very simple to
set<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.280> think<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:49.730> coating<00:03:50.730> Navy<00:03:50.940> can

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
set up I think and a coating Navy can

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.349 
set up I think and a coating Navy can
easily<00:03:51.630> set<00:03:51.900> up<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.440> blade<00:03:52.709> tracking<00:03:53.359> only

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
easily set up the blade tracking only

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.520 
easily set up the blade tracking only
