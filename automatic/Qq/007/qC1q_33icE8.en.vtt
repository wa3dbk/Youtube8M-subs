it<00:00:11.160> was<00:00:11.219> perfect<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.910> did<00:00:12.179> see<00:00:12.330> some<00:00:12.599> people

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it was perfect I did see some people

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.330 
it was perfect I did see some people
saying<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.500> guy<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.889> end<00:00:14.130> though

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
saying with that guy at the end though

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.670 
saying with that guy at the end though
that<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> he<00:00:15.120> killed<00:00:15.420> him<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> sandwich<00:00:16.500> no

mm-hmm<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.739> thing<00:00:43.980> I've<00:00:44.129> noticed<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.910> he

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
mm-hmm but one thing I've noticed is he

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
mm-hmm but one thing I've noticed is he
wears<00:00:45.660> his<00:00:45.780> victims<00:00:46.440> clothing<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.190> trophies

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
wears his victims clothing like trophies

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
wears his victims clothing like trophies
I<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.350> creeped<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
I like that I'm a little creeped out I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.740 
I like that I'm a little creeped out I
like<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> penguin<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
like that in a penguin you like that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
like that in a penguin you like that
under<00:00:52.110> penguin<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.829> thinking<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
under penguin I do I'm thinking that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.740 
under penguin I do I'm thinking that
maybe<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> penguin<00:00:54.300> initially

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
maybe this is how the penguin initially

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
maybe this is how the penguin initially
got<00:00:54.870> fat<00:00:55.110> cuz<00:00:55.500> he<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:59.329> what<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.600> layers

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
got fat cuz he was what I got layers

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
got fat cuz he was what I got layers
yeah<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.340> might<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.789> favorite

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
yeah I think that might be my favorite

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
yeah I think that might be my favorite
