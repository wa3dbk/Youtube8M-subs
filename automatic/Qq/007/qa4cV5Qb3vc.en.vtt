00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.629
 another video on the channel of the daisy 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 service.de company the 2 since many people 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.070
 performance problems with you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.230
 I thought to myself, everybody 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 information together and then in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.920
 a video that shows the performance 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 can improve 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 I will be on the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 conflict parties in the document folder 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.990
 and then we take a look 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 bit the ingame graphics settings 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.720
 on 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.990
 as I said he goes in your documents 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 then folder in the ama two folders and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.180
 opens the arma 2 free config file or 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
 just normal arma 2 depends on what 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.550
 you have the best with the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.780
 notepad + + downloadlink in the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.010
 description is text program what 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 the whole thing a little better and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 over there sure he goes then 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 here in his 19 25 gpu max frames 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.289
 gets at 1 and below that gpu 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.289
 detective frames also gets on 1 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.189
 save 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:10.080
 then you go to the file arma 2 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:13.110
 Operation arrowhead cfg config file like 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.259
 so that you can re-open + + in his 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.509
 19 and 20 the same as the file 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.320
 just change this gpu here 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:28.140
 max frames receives up to 1 as in this case 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:32.040
 then in 2 26 ad hoc on 6 pa on 1 and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.869
 Do not save pr level to 1 either 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.700
 shut down 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.720
 then you go on your on your profile 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 file if you have the basic profile on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790
 the beginning is always used two 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 folder if he creates more profiles 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.759
 have another folder of the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.549
 But means in the name but profiles 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.040
 but I now have the basic profile you 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 alex points but that comes profile 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.170
 yes after com after user name 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.509
 created editor's note bed then on 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.890
 Beginning 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:14.500
 trading quality to zero 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 and then completely down here this five 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:28.510
 top at 0.975 and the booklet at 1.5 599 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.950
 999 999 would have to read off I know that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.950
 really how many new ones are that full 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.060
 69 and then a little bit more 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:46.120
 higher and here mouse moting on 1 with it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.269
 we would have the conflict parties already 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 times improved and see you in the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.440
 ingame graphics settings again so 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.340
 Here we see in game and we 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.330
 will be around us now 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.709
 Graphics settings take care of that 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.000
 option of advanced and you go on 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.269
 Best step by step step by step 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.550
 step by step before of course on 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.230
 best a program down that the fps 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.329
 displays such as the crepes 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.549
 I will also give you a demo version 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.470
 link below and then time me 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.190
 top right halt a yellow indicator 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.850
 and yes, from 30 fps worst I 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.380
 really fluid, where you have to be careful 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.170
 open land where they where so where is nothing 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.560
 can houses get more fps than in the 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.780
 city 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.370
 because the zombies are being used by your pc 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.400
 not from the server but from yours 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.220
 pc controlled it goes on your cpu and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.019
 if 50 zombies in the city behind you 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.160
 running her then has the process 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.010
 of course, more accordingly 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.610
 work and the graphic then suffers 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.810
 including the visibility monday 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.090
 do not set to 1000 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.640
 I have that we'll have a look 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.350
 short ok you have you now 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.890
 Something I noticed sprang up all over 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.340
 high in my opinion that has in the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.720
 it does not matter that's easy 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.329
 then I do not happen very high then 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.609
 interface resolution 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:18.370
 that's just how big the monitor is 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.789
 which resolution supports as 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.789
 full hd 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.979
 Now I also see it here so mine 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.780
 is full hd so that also sets and 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.389
 the 3d resolution is the one in the game 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.919
 I would, however, first of all 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.659
 So that's what yours leads to 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.280
 screen can show what you are up to 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.099
 screwing down every case is anti 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.520
 aliasing you can do the same 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.409
 pose and shadow detail 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.629
 you should also be on normal until the 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:56.620
 Ask sable because of this 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:05:00.520
 eat a lot then unnecessary 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.060
 What are you still doing, how should I 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.159
 to say that 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.250
 skill could worsen namely the 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:09.069
 post process effect that is all this 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.080
 light effects and motion distortion 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.879
 Of course there is no point in the shot 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.099
 pleasing shots also change somehow 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:22.930
 I could therefore be misleading too 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:26.800
 put on the sable yes you can you 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.509
 also the sable actually still optics 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.090
 detail you can calmly put on ferry 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.259
 I also do grad now and at 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.020
 the other should be the whole 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:39.550
 try out 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:43.259
 definitely anti aging and retail 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.099
 Down and postpress effect 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.460
 disabled they will not bring you anything 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.339
 Unless you like these effects if you 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.069
 Now if you are the worst fbs willich 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:57.629
 worst then goes in the 3d resolution 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:00.279
 something down step by step because 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.490
 Well you can think about whether you 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.639
 rather here extremely goes down in Tehran 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.259
 detail is still a bit late 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.139
 So there you should be on it 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.279
 Eighth what should I say 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.889
 If you prefer to stay here for example 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.930
 extremely bad texture or terra 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.940
 wants to renounce details or whether one 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.699
 I prefer minimal because I think so 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.650
 make short or I know with frack the 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.110
 In any case, whether you prefer to 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.399
 a little less sharply 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.080
 wants here for example as 1600 by 900 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:33.919
 looks in my opinion always 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.930
 still good 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.160
 Well, you should do that a bit 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.979
 also dealing with the 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.220
 Graphics settings though I have two 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.380
 traps otherwise i have 30 40 fps in each one 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.960
 city 30 fps 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.740
 currently I have 25 he does not run too 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.510
 still relatively fluid, I have to say 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.280
 and yes that's it, I hope it has all 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.750
 this helped further if the man 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.060
 finally round you want to play 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.080
 but could on the server that is here 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.889
 the de firm the two servers top left 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.860
 you can go to the server again 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.639
 go to the right and see 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.900
 her a video where I am with friends 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.310
 definitely this propeller plane 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.220
 found and also flown 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.780
 here on the server and yes, thank you 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.780
 to watch me and see you
