00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
already this is good any trick is it's

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.479 
already this is good any trick is it's
vegetarian<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.739> probably<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.190> lot<00:03:13.340> less

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
vegetarian and probably a lot less

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.800 
vegetarian and probably a lot less
expensive<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.450> other<00:03:14.600> thing<00:03:14.750> about

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
expensive and the other thing about
