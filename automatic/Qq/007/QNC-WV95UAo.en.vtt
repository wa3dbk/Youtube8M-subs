00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
about less than a year ago and we just

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.530 
about less than a year ago and we just
would<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.410> miss<00:00:34.620> her<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.149> but<00:00:36.149> she's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
so once you bend it in a 90-degree angle

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.230 
so once you bend it in a 90-degree angle
