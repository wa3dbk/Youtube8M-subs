eyeliner difference on both eyes so that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.400 
eyeliner difference on both eyes so that
they<00:00:34.620> look<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> same<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.420> hassle<00:00:36.690> but

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
they look the same which is a hassle but

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
they look the same which is a hassle but
after<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> learn<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.410> pretty

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
after you learn how to do it it's pretty

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.100 
after you learn how to do it it's pretty
good<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.670> fucked-up<00:00:42.540> eyes<00:00:42.719> like

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
good so if you have fucked-up eyes like

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.630 
good so if you have fucked-up eyes like
I<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.739> try<00:00:44.460> learning<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.140> do<00:00:46.140> it

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640

differently<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.850> both<00:00:48.059> eyes<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.780> that's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
differently on both eyes because that's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410 
differently on both eyes because that's
the<00:00:49.230> only<00:00:49.320> way<00:00:49.559> it'll<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.039> symmetrical<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the only way it'll look symmetrical so I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
the only way it'll look symmetrical so I
decided<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.350> eyeliner<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> never

for this also but it crumbles a lot and
that's<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.590> annoying<00:01:19.890> let's<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that's really annoying let's do this the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
that's really annoying let's do this the
problem<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.220> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
problem with this one is it it's really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
problem with this one is it it's really
thick<00:01:24.080> it's<00:01:25.080> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.409> difficult<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
thick it's kind of difficult to get it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.550 
thick it's kind of difficult to get it
the<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.310> consistency<00:01:27.049> because<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the right consistency because if it's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.550 
the right consistency because if it's
too<00:01:28.740> thin<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.759> too<00:01:29.970> watery<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.960> going

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
too thin like too watery it's not going

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
too thin like too watery it's not going
to<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.369> coverage<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:35.090> too<00:01:36.090> thick

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to be of coverage and if it's too thick

00:01:36.780 --> 00:02:01.460 
to be of coverage and if it's too thick
it's<00:01:37.140> freaking<00:01:37.710> difficult<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> work<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.400> so

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.170 

and<00:02:02.470> I've<00:02:02.560> basically<00:02:02.830> tried<00:02:03.490> every<00:02:03.880> kind<00:02:04.060> of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
and I've basically tried every kind of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I've basically tried every kind of
eyeliner<00:02:04.600> there<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.350> entire<00:02:05.530> world

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and I only like applying it with a brush

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300 
and I only like applying it with a brush
because<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.530> only<00:02:14.590> way<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310

so<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> way<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:34.570> according<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.650> me

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
so this is the way to go according to me

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.980 
so this is the way to go according to me
so<00:02:36.460> if<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.580> want<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.150> me<00:02:37.360> definitely

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
so if you want to be like me definitely

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.310 
so if you want to be like me definitely
go<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.980> brush<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.050> cake<00:02:41.050> eyeliner<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
go with a brush and cake eyeliner so I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.410 
go with a brush and cake eyeliner so I
have<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.620> make<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.160> lot<00:02:45.400> thicker<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:46.180> this

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
have to make it a lot thicker on this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.920 
have to make it a lot thicker on this
side<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.610> lot<00:02:48.910> more<00:02:48.940> eyelid<00:02:49.750> on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
side because I have a lot more eyelid on

00:02:49.930 --> 00:03:07.210 
side because I have a lot more eyelid on
the<00:02:49.960> side

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.430 

so<00:03:07.760> now<00:03:07.910> this<00:03:08.090> one<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.450> all<00:03:08.600> round<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.290> this

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
so now this one is all round and this

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.500 
so now this one is all round and this
one<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.710> up<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.130> down<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.640> that's<00:03:10.850> annoying

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
one is up and down and that's annoying

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.070 
one is up and down and that's annoying
and<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:13.040> mean<00:03:13.370> there's<00:03:14.180> no<00:03:14.390> way<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.690> getting<00:03:14.900> it

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
and I mean there's no way of getting it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.270 
and I mean there's no way of getting it
perfect<00:03:15.530> every<00:03:15.620> time

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
perfect every time

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.980 
perfect every time
I<00:03:17.050> just<00:03:18.050> wing<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.520> literally<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.880> hope<00:03:20.810> for

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
I just wing it literally and hope for

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.430 
I just wing it literally and hope for
the<00:03:21.050> best

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the best

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440 
the best
I<00:03:21.470> never<00:03:21.800> like<00:03:22.070> start<00:03:22.340> doing<00:03:22.640> my<00:03:22.730> eyeliner<00:03:22.880> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
I never like start doing my eyeliner and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.500 
I never like start doing my eyeliner and
I'm<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.960> I'm<00:03:24.650> going<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.950> do<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:26.330> do

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
I'm like I'm going to do this I just do

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.240 
I'm like I'm going to do this I just do
it<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.870> whatever<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.710> turns<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.220> be

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it and whatever it turns out to be

00:03:28.250 --> 00:04:29.890 
it and whatever it turns out to be
that's<00:03:29.150> what<00:03:29.360> I'm<00:03:29.450> going<00:03:29.630> with

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.300 

so<00:04:30.560> there<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.160> guess<00:04:32.410> as<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.470> see<00:04:33.919> they're

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
so there I guess as you see they're

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.970 
so there I guess as you see they're
pretty<00:04:34.940> different<00:04:35.240> when<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.720> do<00:04:36.199> like<00:04:36.710> show<00:04:36.919> you

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
pretty different when I do like show you

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.360 
pretty different when I do like show you
like<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.400> but<00:04:37.880> when<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.630> look<00:04:38.900> straight<00:04:39.169> ahead

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
like this but when I look straight ahead

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.760 
like this but when I look straight ahead
they<00:04:40.370> look<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.699> same

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
they look the same

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.040 
they look the same
that's<00:04:42.770> magic<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:44.150> now<00:04:44.330> all<00:04:44.720> that's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that's magic for you and now all that's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:53.980 
that's magic for you and now all that's
missing<00:04:45.199> is<00:04:45.919> some<00:04:46.340> mascara<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.669> there<00:04:52.990> that's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
missing is some mascara so there that's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.920 
missing is some mascara so there that's
how<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.199> do<00:04:54.320> my<00:04:54.410> eyeliner<00:04:54.760> well<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.660> takes
