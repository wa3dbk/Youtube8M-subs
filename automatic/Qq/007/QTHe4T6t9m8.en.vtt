00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pitch for 45 on a comeback and I thought

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520 
pitch for 45 on a comeback and I thought
it<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.619> magic<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it was just magic to to see just the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
it was just magic to to see just the
resilience<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> team<00:01:29.490> again<00:01:29.790> second<00:01:30.329> off

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
resilience of the team again second off

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
resilience of the team again second off
we<00:01:30.810> seem<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> second<00:01:32.009> half<00:01:32.130> comeback

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
we seem to be the second half comeback

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960 
we seem to be the second half comeback
team<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> minute<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.250> that's<00:01:35.250> important<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
team in a minute and that's important to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
team in a minute and that's important to
build<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> character<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> foundation

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
build the character and a foundation

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.069
