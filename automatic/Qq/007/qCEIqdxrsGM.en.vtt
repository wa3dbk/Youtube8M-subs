00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
today I will be discussing my topic I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.189 
today I will be discussing my topic I
really<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.029> got<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.359> hardest<00:00:21.630> one<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really think I got the hardest one I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:32.049 
really think I got the hardest one I
mean<00:00:23.449> describe<00:00:24.449> color<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> blind<00:00:25.199> person

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.100 

so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.120> discussed<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.570> topic<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.989> my

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so I discussed this topic with my

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.850 
so I discussed this topic with my
roommate<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.600> basically<00:00:36.600> concluded<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
roommate and we basically concluded that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.819 
roommate and we basically concluded that
the<00:00:38.070> only<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:39.230> describe<00:00:40.230> color<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the only way to describe color to a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.139 
the only way to describe color to a
blind<00:00:41.010> person<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.640> through<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.030> other

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
blind person is through your other

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.350 
blind person is through your other
senses<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.890> how<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> try<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
senses so that's how I'm going to try to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840 
senses so that's how I'm going to try to
do<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.100> color<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> try

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
do it the first color I'm going to try

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
do it the first color I'm going to try
to<00:00:47.910> describe<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.690> yellow<00:00:49.820> bright<00:00:50.820> yellow<00:00:51.590> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to describe is yellow bright yellow is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.939 
to describe is yellow bright yellow is
like<00:00:52.890> sunshine<00:00:53.280> hitting<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.239> face<00:00:54.890> on<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like sunshine hitting your face on a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.000

accurately describe color to someone who
can't<00:02:15.140> see<00:02:15.260> though<00:02:15.739> because<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.760> way<00:02:16.880> we

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
can't see though because the way we

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.030 
can't see though because the way we
describe<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.750> gonna<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.080> based<00:02:18.319> on<00:02:18.590> our<00:02:18.890> own

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040

experiences with that color like I don't
like<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.220> yellow<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.819> therefore<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> describe

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
like like yellow so therefore I describe

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.850 
like like yellow so therefore I describe
