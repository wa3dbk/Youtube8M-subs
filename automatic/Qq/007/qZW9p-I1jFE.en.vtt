00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.980
 we go 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.980
 an animal 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.440
 and by winning 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.440
 the way 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.760
 that you pass jobs here in general and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.130
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.890
 black ops 2 for the new multiplayer 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.290
 to have the death machine in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.840
 strips for this we need the streak 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.840
 of the package helps more than a machine 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.120
 death and throw the help package a 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.530
 once we catch it, it would simply have to be 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.989
 go down to the death machine or to the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.440
 war machine that we want here and if 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.960
 you look at google and it stays like that 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.239
 I'm in the package streak help but 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.149
 I'm really not on the run of the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.370
 weapons then we have to give the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.800
 right arrow to get it out spend 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.710
 ammo fixes that I have two bullets left 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.929
 now it must affect the right another is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.560
 the right and the bullets will be at maximum 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.780
 again 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.840
 it also serves for the war machine 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 the machine of deaths and unemployed and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.980
 nothing you have to always give them right 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.170
 the right arrow on the part of 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.790
 left the command to get the streak 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 I imagine that if I am a call of call player 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 duty 6 of which I speak perfectly and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.160
 you have nothing and try not to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.230
 spend the ammunition you can and if you like 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.940
 you will not have the streak again but if you 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.380
 you look at the video you see that I have so much 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.900
 death machine as a machine 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 war and I say I remind you that it is 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.729
 take out the help package taking 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.530
 these three mandatory streaks pulling 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.140
 to the help package we take it and once 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.450
 we just have to take out the one that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 the weapon that we want and that's it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 take it out save it save it 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.510
 always without spending the evolution and this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 It serves both for private and for 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.440
 online so nothing a trick for 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.630
 multiplayer that I hope you enjoy 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.200
 you like leissa light and see you in the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200
 next video
