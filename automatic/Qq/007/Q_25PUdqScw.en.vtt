00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.177
Level Doubles Correction-Net play

00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:04.561
Correct way to set racket and body posture

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.308
for net kill and interception at the net

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.261
ok Tim, this is Tim

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:13.792
this is you

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.059
that's your partner

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:19.426
ok point 1 - when you are at the net

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:22.543
ready to intercept

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:27.860
99% your feet position is like that

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.660
and then your racket is forehanded, like this

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.243
ok

00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:36.511
so ready shuttle goes there center

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:42.428
he is not under pressure, but you still make your feet position like that

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:46.983
to cover that corner, like this and your arm is forehanded

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:51.495
so because of that this is easy

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.946
you can get to the shuttle easy here

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:57.247
if shuttle comes to the net you have time to take it

00:00:57.247 --> 00:01:00.045
1 2 3 is easy

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.313
but if opponent hit shuttle to the deeper that corner

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:09.185
then you have to do that and you make mistakes

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.149
ok this has to be changed in this way

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.685
its, if your partner goes to the center

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.667
he is not under pressure he can take that one

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:23.785
after the shot, then your feet has to be changed

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:29.953
from here to square, little bit straight

00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:34.837
and your arm not like that, it should be center

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:38.741
so ready for backhand, forehand both ways

00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:44.036
in this way you can take here, ok here

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.957
you can take there

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:50.607
so you are more ready for intercept and net kill

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:57.108
like this look you are at the moment doing like this

00:01:57.108 --> 00:02:00.225
so that's the problem here, ok

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.258
watch ok

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:09.509
unless your partner is hitting from here corner

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.393
under pressure

00:02:13.394 --> 00:02:16.809
then that's ok because you have to cover that one

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.645
but if he is center not under pressure then you should

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.428
be like that, so if shuttle goes there

00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:25.961
its easy, here

00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:29.529
so you are covering the whole court

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:35.261
so also your racket should be there not like this

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:39.895
because of this here you are ready and side

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:41.138
net

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:42.772
here like this

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:43.388
now

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.523
because your feet is like that

00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:50.325
shoulder went back like that

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:53.660
this is ok, that is easy

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.793
but what happens if shuttle goes little bit quicker here

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.044
then it will be late

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:03.794
that's ok when 

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:07.229
James go there

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:10.796
ok watch this

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:13.572
if James goes to the corner from the center ready

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:14.902
center

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:16.805
go to the corner

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.711
then that's ok because you have to cover that one

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:22.884
1 2 3 defensive

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:26.092
but if he is attacking center

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:30.046
this is opportunity to re-enforce your opponent 

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:33.761
then no like that, it has to be like this ok

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.529
intercept - intercept

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.350
kill - kill like that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.344
no like this

00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:39.162
like this

00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:40.544
so there

00:03:40.544 --> 00:03:41.564
there

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:42.612
there

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:43.246
there

00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:47.897
