00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.280
What's up, everybody? I'm Christopher
Scott and I am officially taking over DS2DIO

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.329
360. Right now. It's all mine. Muahahaha.
Some of you may know me as one of the choreographers

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.880
for So You Think You Can Dance, Step Up Revolution,
or Dancing with the Stars, but today we want

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.890
to talk about one of my very first jobs as
a choreographers for a little show called

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.400
The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers. Since
I was also in the show as an actor playing

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.430
Copeland, the show is very near and dear to
my heart. It's my first love of choreography,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.330
my first love of dance, so I'm very, very
excited today. I'm gonna give you my top 5

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.330
all-time favorite LXD moments. Here we go,
number 5: The Good, the Bad, and the Ra.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.060
Frantick battling Madd Chadd in a Western dance battle
showdown shootout. Crazy-style dance-fighting, glass

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.040
breaking. I've never seen anything like it
before. It was epic. I love it. Number 4:

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.040
The 82nd Annual Academy Awards. We got to
perform to all the scores that were nominated.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.500
Big shout-out to Adam Shankman who brought us in 
 for that after seeing us perform on So You Think

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.760
You Can Dance. Number 3 happened just a couple
nights ago: The LXD finally got to perform

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.639
on Dancing with the Stars. We've been wanting
to do this for a very long time, so it was

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:20.219
like an amazing accomplishment for us and
it was a very powerful message about the strength

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.000
of a woman. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.230
I love when we get to say a message.
Number 2 all-time favorite LXD moment: Ted Talks.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.400
The concept was what the world needs
now and that's what we were representing there

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.500
was what the world needs now is dance. We were
educating the most educated people in the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.200
world about what we do. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.700
We got the longest
standing ovation in Ted history. It was crazy,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.680
crazy. And my Number 1 LXD moment is our very
first performance on So You Think You Can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.159
Dance. It was a pivotal moment for the LXD,
because So You Think gave us that giant platform

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.000
to show the world what street-dancing 
can look like. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.739
So that was my number 1 all-time

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.790
favorite moment, but since I'm taking over
DS2DIO today, I'm gonna pick another number

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.120
1, because I can do whatever I want. Yay...
I, I don't...you guys do that think where people

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.290
applaud? Do people applaud right now? Second
number 1 of all time: Super Ballet starring

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.000
Danny Graham, directed by Jon M. Chu. Roll
the clip. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.400
And there you have it, I hope you

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.350
loved it. And don't forget, check out all
the other episodes of LXD here on DS2DIO.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.720
