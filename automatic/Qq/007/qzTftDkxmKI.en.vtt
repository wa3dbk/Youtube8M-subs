fields the steering wheel is then Center

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.700 
fields the steering wheel is then Center
the<00:01:54.790> front<00:01:55.060> wheels<00:01:55.330> are<00:01:55.630> then<00:01:55.810> adjusted<00:01:55.990> to

four wheels the rear wheels are then set

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.610 
four wheels the rear wheels are then set
