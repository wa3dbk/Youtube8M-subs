00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.160
 Hey, nerd, let's try to elucidate today. 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.250
 some mysteries that surround the monster 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 marvel green the incredible hulk what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 Let's answer today because the pants 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.439
 huck do not rip maybe one of the biggest 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 mysteries that surround the history of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.689
 green marvel giant be yours 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.000
 pants they rip but still good 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.760
 remained intact in the waist line 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 I said good because it would not be anything 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.690
 cool seeing the hulk in a doctor version 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.200
 green manhattan 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 The answer to this puzzle is that in 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 1954 American Association of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.960
 the cma in the English acronym created the comics 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 code governing the publication of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.610
 Incomplete content in comics 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.160
 according to Stephanie the creator of 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.469
 huck if it was not for that code the pants 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the huck were ripped in the same way as the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 rest of your clothes in another 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 an interview with vanity magazine 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 fair in March 2011 is he tried 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 explain the mysterious phenomenon 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 he said that because blues benner 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.710
 to be very friendly to richards sir 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.990
 fantastic he would have received from 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.420
 richards macau gift 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 elastic and that despite this explain 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.869
 a lot of things we should decide if 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 accept or not we this reason well 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.640
 not be that the fantastic gentleman besides 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 scientist inventor passes much of the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.530
 her time as fashion designer for 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.610
 bruce banner yes why do you think pants are not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 I do not fall, they are not there because the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.399
 hulk is green because of an error in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 printing in the debut magazine in its 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.759
 first edition in may 1962 the hulk 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.950
 came up gray because the screenwriter are 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.250
 I wanted a color with no connotations 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 ethnic but the colorist are godard 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.719
 complained about the quality of the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.640
 magazine in which the tonality ended 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.700
 helming a lot to solve the problem 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.540
 they both took on the new color 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.299
 this was not the only run 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.640
 are retroactive proposed by you alter 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.430
 ego of the hero vos benner happened to be 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.689
 call benner lombards when they are 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.730
 called it by mistake of bob in an edition 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.519
 at the end of the 80s the Peter writer 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.590
 david solved back with gray hulk 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.500
 as a new personality of the hero 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.090
 smarter manipulator renamed 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.909
 Like a thief 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 a curiosity in the 60's the green 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.709
 impressed so well that several villains of the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.730
 Spiderman also got that color 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.439
 doctor octopus elektro lizard scorpion 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.989
 among others 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.250
 what are the differences between the green hulk 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.870
 what a red 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.489
 deceived who said that the only 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.439
 difference is color 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.049
 yes there are several important differences 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.079
 between the two characters despite the 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.299
 similarities at the basic level both the 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.419
 that red and general tantusz kantor 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.239
 bull ross and what a green doctor bruce 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.419
 banner are very similar both have 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.340
 vast force on human and are 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.900
 undoubtedly two of the most 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.639
 strong of the planet 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.430
 they have an incredible rate of 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.299
 regeneration and resistance of the human 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 lesion 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.159
 both show and vulnerability almost 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.349
 complete weapons of human origin 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.900
 both have demonstrated the ability to 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.359
 fight against human target opponents of 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.549
 great power and have fought and defeated 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.310
 some of its most powerful 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.010
 marvel universe for the green hulk 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.139
 the angrier he gets, the stronger he gets 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.109
 gets your anger increases your production 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.989
 physics its damage its resistance and 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.989
 there seems to be no limit to 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.290
 with bravo that can become so 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.540
 their powers seem to have no limit to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.150
 the red hulk increase your powers 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.269
 enough to be exposed to radiation and in 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.609
 particular gamma radiation it can 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.909
 channel and take advantage of a variety of 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.459
 radiations including cosmic radiation 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.190
 the higher your exposure 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.650
 powerful physically it stays in 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.050
 battles against the green hulk the power of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.850
 red hulk would increase since what 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.850
 verdi and 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.550
 low-level gamma rays all the time 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.400
 where they differ is in the amount of 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.620
 radiation output while green hulk 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.500
 always generates a certain quantity 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.890
 of gamma radiation the energy generated from 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.530
 red hulk is significantly larger 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.840
 the more the red hulk fights more 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.000
 hot it becomes when it arrives a 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.520
 certain heat threshold becomes 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.830
 disoriented and vulnerable 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.260
 one of the other important differences is 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.170
 the ability to temper and combat 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.970
 of the two characters while what I see 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.490
 is a scientist trapped in a body of a 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.550
 monster what red a soldier with 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.040
 powers of the look to his aggression 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.350
 dominant personality experience in 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.990
 combat made him a very 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.240
 more dangerous than what the verdi 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.610
 comics 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.370
 where does huck's mass come from? 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.440
 transforms into basic physics we learn 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.980
 that it is not possible to create dough from 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.590
 from zero then how the benny benner gets 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.880
 makes a giant monster from where it comes 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.340
 all this mass 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.220
 it is enough to see in its transformation that the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.070
 weight is noticeably increased when the 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.940
 hulk runs down to the asphalt where 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.340
 steps 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.560
 if we go through normal physics this 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.870
 explanation does not make sense 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.730
 jeff parker the current writer of 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.950
 hulk stories in marvel comics 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.870
 answered this question on your twitter 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.300
 saying that his explanation for the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.940
 The huck's transformation is that he 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.000
 energy of the environment and transforms 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.370
 This in bulk, well then I think better. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.310
 gef continue as a writer because 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.010
 how physically he was disapproved 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.870
 the explanation in marvel and American is of 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.240
 that the gamma radiation that transforms 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.050
 huck body fortifies its structure 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.290
 and adds from some source yet 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.230
 unknown 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.380
 possibly extra-dimensional several 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.370
 pounds of bone muscles and other things 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.890
 in your body 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.530
 well let's settle for this 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.470
 explanation with the fastest way to 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.500
 kill the hulk for this answer in 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.030
 We had a lot of debate and we 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.139
 conclusion that the best way to 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.479
 end life 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.909
 green monster the best thing to 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.280
 to do it would calm it down and there 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:47.009
 ask how until he becomes a 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.469
 chicken bruce banner at the moment 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.960
 we could shoot her in the head but 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:53.759
 the conclusion was precipitated 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.789
 we need only remember that in 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.919
 movie moment the avengers benner 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:01.319
 open the heart and reveal the rest 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.509
 players who tried to kill themselves for 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.229
 end the huck ' curse on your 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.449
 life 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.930
 the exact phrase uttered by the 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:13.529
 characters and I tried but the other guy 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:16.050
 spit out the phrase refers to 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.689
 edward norton's version for the hulk that 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.539
 in a scene filmed and cut from his 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:23.729
 movie showed this attempt, ie 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:26.099
 You can shoot the sky from the mouth of 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.620
 beer that will not do anything but 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:30.900
 make you nervous and you will not 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.139
 want but if you want to know how 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:37.610
 kill the truth watch this video that the 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.889
 explanation is well detailed 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.169
 this is it nerd has ideas for new 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.240
 characters comments and make your 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:48.270
