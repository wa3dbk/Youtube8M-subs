00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.310 
just stupid or blue vyas they there is
actually<00:02:01.920> nothing<00:02:02.159> wrong<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.719> what

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
actually nothing wrong so that's what

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.819 
actually nothing wrong so that's what
they<00:02:04.530> convey<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.969> courage<00:02:06.420> being<00:02:07.409> what

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
they convey it's just courage being what

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.730 
they convey it's just courage being what
courage<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:09.410> Cowardly<00:02:10.410> Dog<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
courage is a Cowardly Dog so I think the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.310 
courage is a Cowardly Dog so I think the
theory<00:02:14.070> actually<00:02:14.280> could<00:02:14.790> make<00:02:14.940> some<00:02:15.180> sense<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
theory actually could make some sense so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.670 
theory actually could make some sense so
it<00:02:16.620> would<00:02:16.740> explain<00:02:17.480> how<00:02:18.480> Muriel<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> Eustace

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it would explain how Muriel and Eustace

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.780 
it would explain how Muriel and Eustace
can<00:02:20.040> seem<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:21.050> unimaginably<00:02:22.050> stupid<00:02:22.980> most<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
can seem so unimaginably stupid most of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.010 
can seem so unimaginably stupid most of
the<00:02:23.910> time<00:02:24.180> when<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.570> don't<00:02:24.690> know<00:02:24.870> what's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the time when they don't know what's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.660 
the time when they don't know what's
going<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.440> there's<00:02:25.830> some<00:02:25.920> episodes<00:02:26.460> where

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
going on there's some episodes where

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.450 
going on there's some episodes where
they<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.940> known<00:02:27.180> what's<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.460> not

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
they have known what's going on but not

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
they have known what's going on but not
many<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:31.490> they<00:02:32.490> are<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.000> acting<00:02:33.240> like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
many and they are just acting like

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.850 
many and they are just acting like
there's<00:02:33.810> nothing<00:02:34.080> wrong<00:02:34.260> most<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.770> time

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
there's nothing wrong most of the time

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.730 
there's nothing wrong most of the time
because<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.420> nothing<00:02:37.050> wrong<00:02:37.410> is

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
because there really is nothing wrong is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.530 
because there really is nothing wrong is
just<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.220> normal<00:02:38.400> happenings<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.210> town

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
just the normal happenings of the town

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.950 
just the normal happenings of the town
and<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:40.620> coming<00:02:40.890> over<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:42.030> courage<00:02:42.510> has

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
and people coming over that courage has

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.060 
and people coming over that courage has
just<00:02:43.320> never<00:02:43.530> seen<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.240> not<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.070> tell

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
just never seen so I'm not going to tell

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.420 
just never seen so I'm not going to tell
you<00:02:47.250> how<00:02:47.550> much<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.150> think<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.110> holds<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.070> water

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
you how much I think this holds up water

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.800 
you how much I think this holds up water
but<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.850> fun<00:02:54.090> theory<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
but I think that it's a fun theory and I

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.770 
but I think that it's a fun theory and I
wanted<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.500> talk<00:02:55.680> about<00:02:55.710> it<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.220> my<00:02:56.550> first
