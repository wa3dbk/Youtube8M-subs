00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
very endearing so it's very nice very

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
very endearing so it's very nice very
simple<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> fact<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> hair

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
simple I like the fact that the hair

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 
simple I like the fact that the hair
makeup<00:00:21.539> also<00:00:21.750> has<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.050> overdone<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.830> an<00:00:23.010> art

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
makeup also has not overdone it's an art

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830 
makeup also has not overdone it's an art
to<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.670> able<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.910> put<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> together<00:00:24.330> nicely

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to be able to put it together nicely

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.019 
to be able to put it together nicely
it's<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.769> costumes<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.760> short

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it's not the costumes the way it's short

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.910 
it's not the costumes the way it's short
the<00:00:27.359> way<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> hair<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.470> done<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> make

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the way that the hair is done the make

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.050 
the way that the hair is done the make
of<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.640> came<00:00:29.910> together

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
of it and all of that came together

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
of it and all of that came together
really<00:00:30.420> nicely<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.040> why

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
really nicely for and I think that's why

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.500 
really nicely for and I think that's why
it's<00:00:32.309> been<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.460> underlined<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.180> each<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it's been so underlined by each and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.229 
it's been so underlined by each and
everyone<00:00:33.840> watching<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> film's<00:00:34.770> trailers<00:00:35.340> us

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
everyone watching the film's trailers us

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.299 
everyone watching the film's trailers us
they<00:00:36.719> calling<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> her<00:00:37.320> South<00:00:37.559> Indian<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
they calling it her South Indian look I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.410 
they calling it her South Indian look I
think<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.640> than<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.300> fact

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
think more than that is just the fact

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
think more than that is just the fact
that<00:00:39.570> she<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> carry<00:00:40.110> off<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> society<00:00:40.800> really

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that she can carry off a society really

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.119 
that she can carry off a society really
nicely<00:00:41.280> even<00:00:42.120> though<00:00:42.390> she's<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.050> young<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.469> love

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
nicely even though she's so young I love

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
nicely even though she's so young I love
that<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.899> two<00:00:45.899> states<00:00:46.170> where<00:00:46.350> Ananias<00:00:46.890> look

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that about two states where Ananias look

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.510 
that about two states where Ananias look
