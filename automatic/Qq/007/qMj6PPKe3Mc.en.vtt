00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
some rice on the lights on the BRZ mmm

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.029 
some rice on the lights on the BRZ mmm
that's<00:00:16.440> right

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that's right

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
that's right
this<00:00:17.789> Tron<00:00:19.220> BRD<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.580> now<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> real

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
this Tron BRD is now going to be a real

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.980 
this Tron BRD is now going to be a real
Tom<00:00:23.160> BRZ<00:00:24.439> go<00:00:25.439> throw<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:25.800> lights<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.310> here

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
Tom BRZ go throw these lights on here

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
Tom BRZ go throw these lights on here
interior<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.230> exterior<00:00:28.730> because<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.970> know

how we what experience do you have with
electric<00:00:34.920> stuff<00:00:36.140> circuit<00:00:37.140> once<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.370> all

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
electric stuff circuit once I don't all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.750 
electric stuff circuit once I don't all
I<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> solder<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.550> really

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
I know I do this solder so I'm really

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
I know I do this solder so I'm really
moving<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.559> nothing<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.129> know

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
moving on so you know nothing I know

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
moving on so you know nothing I know
zero<00:00:44.940> yep<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.570> nothing

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
zero yep you know nothing

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
zero yep you know nothing
I<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> wire<00:00:46.739> circuit<00:00:47.219> board<00:00:47.430> from

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
I don't know the wire circuit board from

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.450 
I don't know the wire circuit board from
them<00:00:51.230> Wow<00:00:53.000> come<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.270> oh<00:00:56.449> I<00:00:57.859> like<00:00:58.859> touching<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
them Wow come in oh I like touching it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.139 
them Wow come in oh I like touching it
like<00:00:59.670> staring<00:01:00.570> into<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.199> blinding

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.240 

so<00:01:08.049> after<00:01:08.350> realizing<00:01:08.799> that<00:01:08.829> we<00:01:09.070> knew<00:01:09.219> nothing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
so after realizing that we knew nothing

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.090 
so after realizing that we knew nothing
about<00:01:09.820> what<00:01:09.969> we<00:01:10.299> were<00:01:10.420> doing<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:11.229> had<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:11.890> reach

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
about what we were doing we had to reach

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.760 
about what we were doing we had to reach
out<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.579> an<00:01:12.850> outside<00:01:13.299> friend<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:14.350> past<00:01:14.560> couple

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
out to an outside friend the past couple

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.859 
out to an outside friend the past couple
days<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.189> get<00:01:15.280> some<00:01:15.520> knowledge<00:01:15.969> about<00:01:16.299> what

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
days to get some knowledge about what

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.330 
days to get some knowledge about what
we're<00:01:17.020> doing<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.469> how<00:01:17.530> we're<00:01:17.829> going<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.039> do<00:01:18.189> it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
we're doing and how we're going to do it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.889 
we're doing and how we're going to do it

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
so what I what okay what Calvin has done

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.630 
so what I what okay what Calvin has done
is<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.709> have<00:01:23.770> ran<00:01:24.929> cable<00:01:25.929> or<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.200> wire<00:01:26.740> from<00:01:27.579> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
is I have ran cable or a wire from the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.749 
is I have ran cable or a wire from the
battery<00:01:28.649> through<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.770> firewall<00:01:30.219> to<00:01:30.429> my

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
battery through the firewall to my

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.999 
battery through the firewall to my
glovebox<00:01:31.030> which<00:01:31.600> will<00:01:32.259> relate<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.829> these

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
glovebox which will relate to these

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.300 
glovebox which will relate to these
switches<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.759> then<00:01:34.329> from<00:01:34.600> these<00:01:34.780> switches<00:01:35.319> it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
switches and then from these switches it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.630 
switches and then from these switches it
goes<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.819> another<00:01:36.909> wire<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:38.079> leads<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:39.220> and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
goes to another wire that leads out and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:50.280 
goes to another wire that leads out and
then<00:01:39.909> that<00:01:40.179> will<00:01:40.390> control<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.250> yeah

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:23.960

wires through the bottom little car the
holes<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:12.409> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.709> find<00:03:13.159> underneath<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
holes that you can find underneath the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.910 
holes that you can find underneath the
tools<00:03:14.930> units<00:03:15.470> which<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.370> built<00:03:16.609> up<00:03:17.799> what<00:03:18.799> I've

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
tools units which is built up what I've

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.360 
tools units which is built up what I've
done<00:03:19.329> with<00:03:20.329> those<00:03:20.599> wires<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.799> twisted<00:03:22.280> them

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
done with those wires and twisted them

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.759 
done with those wires and twisted them
together<00:03:22.599> because<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:23.870> can't<00:03:24.079> be<00:03:24.200> bothered<00:03:24.379> to

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
together because I can't be bothered to

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.379 
together because I can't be bothered to
started<00:03:25.280> oh<00:03:25.400> thank<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> baby

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
started oh thank you baby

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.890 
started oh thank you baby

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
the ones from underneath the bumper and

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.470 
the ones from underneath the bumper and
the<00:03:32.000> ones<00:03:32.389> underneath<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:34.069> wheel<00:03:34.250> wells<00:03:34.519> all

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
the ones underneath the wheel wells all

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.860 
the ones underneath the wheel wells all
here<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.739> now<00:03:36.950> after<00:03:37.159> that<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.659> wire

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
here and now after that I have to wire

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.470 
here and now after that I have to wire
it<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.439> front<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.400> ground<00:03:40.669> it<00:03:40.819> up<00:03:40.910> that's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it to the front and ground it up that's
