00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello everyone here it would take too much 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.719
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.839
 presentation of the new rayman game 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.380
 jungle ron so that's available on 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.680
 the apple store so the price of 2 euros 39 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 so this game is really cool I think 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
 he uses the same graphics as his 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.920
 predecessor so rayman origins 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 available on pc and consoles hd 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.200
 likewise on wii besides so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.840
 frankly I 'm going to show you this and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.239
 you will make your own to live me I 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 really nice that we're going 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.690
 test that so here we come in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 the two menu of rayman jungle run so 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 we can see that the graphics 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.760
 are the same as on rayman origins 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.969
 so are still in the universe of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.149
 emanates so we can see that we 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 have several tips so the option so 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.100
 there you can adjust the options of the game 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 gallery that adds a little movies 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 that allow you to earn money 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 by playing hits with the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.610
 game center size than a ranking so 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.290
 now we will start playing 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.689
 so then there you can see that it's 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.180
 breaks down into four parts including four 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.430
 chapters so jumped flap run on 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.729
 walls and punches So there I 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.880
 will ride on running so there we can 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.829
 see that there are several and killian 10 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 levels with a boss I believe I have 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.369
 not tried yet we will test together 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.390
 and so there you can see that there is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.460
 three gems so a blue jay a gem 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.689
 green and a red gem so the young 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 red is when you do a level 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.740
 perfect because they're going to have 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.479
 you have to have five to unlock the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.320
 boss is where could see that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.570
 one of the singles 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.500
 so here we will test on this level 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.500
 Let's go 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.190
 so here you can see the music 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.690
 his shot is also from rayman origins 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.010
 so if you want to have a red jam 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.010
 he 'll make you a no-fault 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.800
 good if I do not play very well what I 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 also have to control the camera so 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.330
 it's a little complicated good you see a 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.580
 it's really rayman's world 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
 origins it's really respected so 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.650
 your characters your character actually 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.620
 short all alone you just have to at 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.820
 touch the screen to jump so there you 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.100
 can see that I had both 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.780
 throws but not the red gem so so 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.890
 you will see that it takes really hard 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.600
 still in tight time man it's 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.610
 reputed to be a complicated game when 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.380
 even 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.630
 so we'll see the boss now 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.300
 so we will discover that all this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.980
 part so I want to clarify that I 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.870
 have not done so then jump from 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.350
 the death angel of these fish 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.950
 ah yes okay it's timed ok ok 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.860
 well it's great it starts well 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.820
 go hop a little rock show it's not going 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.900
 to do it is really hard way 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.209
 yeah but really do a trick 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.790
 perfect 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:37.700
 we were waiting up there seriously lolo lolo 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.700
 like from the top it's perfect 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:50.650
 ok okay low but how am I doing there 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:56.560
 I really have to be ok agree that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.629
 it's really hard 1up there to huy an email 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.940
 at this level you have to jump 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:11.349
 perfect actually all the time at these 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:12.940
 dead and let's validate ok I think we 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.900
 will go to another level there because 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.900
 it's really complex 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.380
 oh no good go last try and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.740
 we pass to others what else I 'm going 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 disgust you from the game so we'll go 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:40.000
 back to the menu so we will test a 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:42.099
 other chapter so we'll try what 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.190
 on the walls a lot that I'm tired 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.660
 a little similar to make fly go 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.460
 this is my time flash system 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:55.530
 that you this level anna tac 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.580

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.400
 as on rayman origins 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:06.930
 yeah but that's his head 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.930
 ok okay and try 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:18.699
 an ace in grandpa so the levels are 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.699
 generally quite common anyway 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:24.259
 but hey I'll tell you that it's 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.999
 really very very fluid 1 on iphone 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.389
 ramparts that I will not do 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.529
