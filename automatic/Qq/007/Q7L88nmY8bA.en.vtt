00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:06.540
 Now my school will be two kinds of beans. 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.540
 How is it 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.450
 Eyes do not look very different on both sides 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.000
 FIG phase geureotgoyo 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.350
 So what about the coffee flavored with this bean ? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.920
 One of these is made from two years old rosé. 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.830
 The other one is coffee made from 4 days old roast beans. 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.430
 I do not know which way this year. 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:41.450
 I 'll taste it myself. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.370
 Experts Furukawa until it sounds rather just drink coffee when busy 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.490
 I'll give it to the public. 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.900
 Please drink like I serve this time 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.860
 That's why you can feel coffee aroma stronger. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.860
 I'll try. 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.509
 It's the same taste you usually drink. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 Back 5 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 4 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 I do not know, but I think this is fresh. 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.560
 From here it looks like a little heavy flavor. 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:45.729
 It's my feeling. Let me check it out. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.729
 얜 This is a year old , and then I chose this one as a living thing. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 Neundeyo still finished it two years 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 And now it's four days now. 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.070
 The 3 surely tastes a little savory in old coffee 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 It's funny. It's old. 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.930
 The're gonna end up bad Kaoru Coffee old need to understand so 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.730
 Will 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.730
 And as the best match we'll receive a fresh 30-sour taste in your mouth 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.350
 I have a lot of sour taste too. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.840
 I knew 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 In fact, the fresher the coffee, the stronger the third place. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.370
 I will 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:40.830
 But 23b is not the vinegar's 19 hearts and this juice is 1 year old 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 It is a taste close to freshness, so after drinking it feels fresh and refreshing. 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.640
 I like that feeling. 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.880
 What is the taste of fresh coffee? 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 I think I'm going to do it now. 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.100
 Most large franchise cafes at the headquarters for the unity of the line masters 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.980
 Proceed with roasting 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.010
 So, roasting and coming to the consumer 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.540
 It may take more than two months 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 I do not think this coffee is good coffee. 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:17.500
 So what is good coffee? 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.500
 We got the advice of experts and set three criteria 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:29.310
 First, how to make coffee with fresh coffee beans freshly roasted in addition origin directly to Parliament 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:34.140
 4 Go comes in a way that helps the green beans of good quality, also to producers 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.260
 There are also six such goodies on the menu that are good for both producers and consumers . 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.190
 Whether 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.190
 Is there any country that satisfies such a demanding condition ?
