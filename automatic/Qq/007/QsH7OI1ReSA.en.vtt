they created their own which they could
do<00:02:18.530> but<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.160> rare<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.120> r<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.630> ain't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
do but it's rare and you r it like ain't

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
do but it's rare and you r it like ain't
hardly<00:02:21.290> any<00:02:21.560> crossover<00:02:22.160> games<00:02:22.520> such<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.210> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
hardly any crossover games such as this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330 
hardly any crossover games such as this
actually<00:02:25.700> create<00:02:26.120> their<00:02:26.390> own<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:27.340> fighting

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
actually create their own a fighting

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.980 
actually create their own a fighting
style<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:29.150> their<00:02:29.390> own<00:02:29.480> fighting<00:02:29.780> mechanics

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
style of their own fighting mechanics

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.550 
style of their own fighting mechanics
and<00:02:31.000> I'm<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.390> saying<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.780> would<00:02:32.990> be<00:02:33.110> quite

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and I'm just saying it would be quite

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.850 
and I'm just saying it would be quite
difficult<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.460> them<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.610> actually<00:02:35.860> persecute

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
difficult for them to actually persecute

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.460 
difficult for them to actually persecute
this<00:02:37.150> type<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.530> video<00:02:39.530> game<00:02:39.740> um<00:02:41.260> Plus<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.440> be

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
this type of video game um Plus to be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.100 
this type of video game um Plus to be
honest<00:02:42.980> when<00:02:43.820> actually<00:02:44.240> it's<00:02:44.540> not<00:02:44.720> actually

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
honest when actually it's not actually

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.670 
honest when actually it's not actually
the<00:02:45.200> best<00:02:45.440> idea<00:02:45.920> um<00:02:47.140> because<00:02:48.140> first<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.560> all

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the best idea um because first of all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.120 
the best idea um because first of all
it'll<00:02:49.010> probably<00:02:49.220> just<00:02:49.540> throw<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.780> more

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
it'll probably just throw in more

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.490 
it'll probably just throw in more
controversy<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.370> more<00:02:52.580> fanboys<00:02:53.500> because

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
controversy and more fanboys because

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.010

what we really need is we need a

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.010 
what we really need is we need a
Nintendo<00:05:45.919> vs<00:05:46.280> capcom<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:47.419> would<00:05:47.660> be<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:47.810> good

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
game use the pretty much same engine as

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.560

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.620 
characters I think that'd be a really
nice<00:05:59.450> touch<00:05:59.720> right<00:05:59.780> there<00:05:59.990> um<00:06:01.120> but<00:06:02.120> yeah<00:06:02.300> this

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
nice touch right there um but yeah this

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.330 
nice touch right there um but yeah this

comics together called marvel vs DC
marvel<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:25.430> DC<00:06:26.200> stuff<00:06:27.200> like<00:06:27.470> that<00:06:27.500> I<00:06:28.160> don't

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
marvel and DC stuff like that I don't

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.530 
marvel and DC stuff like that I don't
know<00:06:28.460> if<00:06:28.520> those<00:06:28.669> are<00:06:28.850> really<00:06:29.030> just<00:06:29.270> fanmade

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
know if those are really just fanmade

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.540 
know if those are really just fanmade
covers<00:06:30.110> but<00:06:30.290> they're<00:06:30.770> big<00:06:30.950> they're<00:06:30.979> selling

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
covers but they're big they're selling

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.040 
covers but they're big they're selling
like<00:06:31.580> on<00:06:31.850> amazon<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:32.510> stuff<00:06:32.720> so<00:06:32.870> i'm<00:06:32.930> assuming

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
like on amazon and stuff so i'm assuming

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.120 
like on amazon and stuff so i'm assuming
they're<00:06:33.470> they're<00:06:34.070> real<00:06:34.700> um<00:06:35.710> so<00:06:36.710> if<00:06:36.830> they<00:06:36.979> can

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
they're they're real um so if they can

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.590 
they're they're real um so if they can
do<00:06:37.340> that<00:06:37.370> they<00:06:37.820> could<00:06:37.970> probably

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
do that they could probably

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.810 
do that they could probably
come<00:06:38.900> up<00:06:39.020> with<00:06:39.200> something<00:06:39.710> but<00:06:40.280> as<00:06:40.430> of<00:06:40.760> right

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
come up with something but as of right

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.820 
come up with something but as of right
now<00:06:41.090> there's<00:06:41.990> no<00:06:42.230> chance<00:06:42.500> that<00:06:42.590> we<00:06:42.740> could

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
now there's no chance that we could

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.470 
now there's no chance that we could
probably<00:06:43.040> get<00:06:43.250> that<00:06:43.400> game<00:06:43.580> because<00:06:44.060> there's

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
probably get that game because there's

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.660 
probably get that game because there's
nothing<00:06:44.750> to<00:06:44.930> face<00:06:45.260> the<00:06:45.590> there's<00:06:46.370> nothing<00:06:46.490> to

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
nothing to face the there's nothing to

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.080 
nothing to face the there's nothing to
base<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.090> game<00:06:47.270> on<00:06:47.450> um<00:06:48.440> it's<00:06:48.770> jit<00:06:49.700> would<00:06:49.820> just

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
base the game on um it's jit would just

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.040 
base the game on um it's jit would just
it<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.830> couldn't<00:06:52.130> really<00:06:52.310> make<00:06:52.640> something

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
it you couldn't really make something

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.870 
it you couldn't really make something
like<00:06:54.050> it<00:06:54.230> takes<00:06:54.500> a<00:06:54.710> lot<00:06:54.920> of<00:06:54.950> time<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.520> come<00:06:55.850> up

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
like it takes a lot of time to come up

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.540 
like it takes a lot of time to come up
with<00:06:56.000> a<00:06:56.710> fighting<00:06:57.710> like<00:06:57.980> fighting<00:06:58.400> mechanics

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
with a fighting like fighting mechanics

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.030 
with a fighting like fighting mechanics
for<00:06:58.820> that<00:06:58.970> kind<00:06:59.240> of<00:06:59.300> game<00:06:59.680> but<00:07:00.680> as<00:07:00.800> of<00:07:00.980> right

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
for that kind of game but as of right

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.910 
for that kind of game but as of right
now<00:07:01.220> I<00:07:01.990> can't<00:07:02.990> really<00:07:03.170> see<00:07:03.290> that<00:07:03.410> game<00:07:03.560> coming

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
now I can't really see that game coming

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.000 
now I can't really see that game coming
