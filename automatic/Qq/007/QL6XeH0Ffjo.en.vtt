00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 On the one hand I'm going to show you a putter 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.339
 a tutorial on how to find minerals 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.339
 medium quick 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.010
 here it is 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.010
 You can follow that place 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.180
 lifetime 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.600
 so 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.140
 hair 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.850
 if they are now 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.129
 so good physically this is my 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 home and now I go to my life and good as 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.059
 I said I'm going to show you how to teach 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 how to find integrate is much more 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 Quick 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.330
 7 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020
 so 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 Here I have a little room with things that I have 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.500
 found in the mine 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.980
 listeners 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 the accounts to follow 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.240
 in case it takes me a bit and the way is 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.240
 something long but there is no hurry 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 as you see this eliminates I was doing it 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.490
 of three spaces 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.880
 and then he saw her open a hole for him 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.039
 7 x 6 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.280
 to make it a way around here that they have 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.289
 explored another one around here that is the one 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.289
 I'm going to show you another one here 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.420
 but to cover it because an incident that 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.110
 I do not have time to tell it in another 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.950
 way and here or formally good what 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.630
 first is to go down alavedra that is the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.050
 mother stone 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 you have to climb two floors 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:17.530
 10 13 does not matter 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.150
 eleven 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.750
 there 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.740
 you start to vilar and smoke fast what 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.210
 Believe and look what can be 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.990
 but it can not be fast 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.990
 music 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.890
 it can not be look look how fast what 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.040
 quick to find this 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.790
 as we saw is very simple and we mount 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.790
 with another way 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.770
 as you see it is very simple 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.680
 here I can look for more but then 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.409
 the simple days rained 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.409
 ok now I 'm going to show you another guy 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 another way to find rivers 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.550
 or not 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.180
 goodbye this thing if it takes a long time 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.349
 but another kind another way to find 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.349
 fast minerals 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:23.609
 is that I did it wrong here but 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.609
 another way is doing it 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.480
 one way 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.440
 then light 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.440
 or so 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.900
 as well as this straight 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.900
 but try not to get 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:47.200
 and nectar of not getting 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.590
 to the end of the world 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.290
 I did not think it well before and the end of 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.480
 world but I took too long in 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.910
 find diamonds 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.910
 minerals the truth is that 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.270
 look here I have all the diamonds there 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.940
 that they did 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.800
 they left me flying somewhere else to 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.800
 know what is this 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.569
 then it is to say 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.910
 and in this way it is simpler less 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.910
 probable 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.240
 but it serves 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.809
 so 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.580
 and it's more welcome it's more advisable that 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.580
 make the mine inside your house 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.780
 for anything I'm going to do it 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.009
 something bad happens 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.270
 and know that he 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.270
 be an example 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.580
 at the time of lying 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.329
 then that is all 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.020
 and remember my height 12 12 above the 

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:10.840
 of the 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.400
 the mother rock the broken time 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.400
 then that is all 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.720
 they
