00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.120
 there were two kids rodri footballer in my 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.300
 desk to bring your natural of the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.080
 plans for Kate and we are with dragon 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.390
 travel 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.259
 it is a plugin the truth quite handsome 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.360
 it's about going up one place to another in 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.020
 dragon 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.020
 good 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.980
 includes all this has several things with 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.070
 spot craft that can be pretty 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 beautiful 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 the messages can be customizable 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.050
 I will try to translate something I already have 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.899
 translated something good requires like 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.110
 dependence the volt unloaded the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.300
 latest versions of both work in 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 1.5 point 2 the volt for example but the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 dragon travel is already for the 1.5 point 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600
 two 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.800
 OK 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.800
 and what downloads do you put in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.570
 in your plugins folder like me 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.520
 I have here and impaired got into the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 plugins folder as you see here I have 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820
 the volt 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'm missing insurance and if nothing 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.100
 for example and another acid this 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.110
 they are going to see 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.159
 you can translate all the messages that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 you were as is 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.190
 the confession I recommend you touch anything 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.690
 this is for economy what you have to 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.800
 pay if you want to have the city for the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.480
 tribal 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.470
 let's see let's see let's see 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.750
 from before grifol dragons that can not 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.750
 no fear and the grid 1 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.909
 I can not put these commands 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.909
 while going on it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.730
 I include this command for example tpa 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.470
 ward and so you can put everything 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.470
 you want the truth 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.080
 LOL 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 now let's move on to the part of what 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 is 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.020
 in made in game and well we are already 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.700
 in game 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.140
 I'm with cute deco 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.950
 in agreement we will teach you the basics how 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.840
 create stations because this the truth 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.790
 it does not serve you the truth this serves for um 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 a plus 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.230
 the truth serves us this is to go 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.079
 missing and dragon but this is what 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 we are really interested in page 2 of 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.840
 agreement to select a station 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.770
 this will be our station you can 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.400
 put it high as is 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.000
 you put 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 thirst 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.760
 Lets put 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.709
 is the proof of this now let's go 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.060
 destination 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 that good 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 so that we put 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.430
 dt 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.430
 thirst for this 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 of this 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.549
 now it would be you could do as per 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.330
 example the command things and put here 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.320
 a poster the scj lic 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.320
 the click that you want 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.930
 and then automatically the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.330
 command if you know how to assign the poster 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.260
 but we have to put on 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.700
 here for example we can do from 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.000
 mount goes riding a directly to 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.000
 drone 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.850
 we would not move clearly that would be 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.850
 tea 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.590
 tests 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.870
 and automatically I do not know why it is 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.130
 this latest version does not tie other 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.440
 versions has not been as low to 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.440
 make the allegations perfectly 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.870
 but hey, it does not really make us what 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.600
 we want you to take us from one place to another 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.920
 in agreement 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.920
 well I put like this 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.630
 this action is not necessary to put it 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.440
 We can adapt the world in what 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.440
 measured direction 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.590
 directly from travel proof of this 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.860
 he is quite handsome the truth 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.850
 you can put the speed you can change 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.850
 the speed of all that 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:52.110
 and good really then to remove 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.510
 it would be from this state 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.689
 test 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.589
 this 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.589
 and then it would be 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.950
 of is 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.020
 test 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.190
 from this 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.650
 and I hope you liked it 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.360
 give him the different and all that theme 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.660
 thank you very much everyone and greetings 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.660
 usual
