00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Using the Atacama Large Millimeter / Millennium Network ALMA telescopes, astronomers 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 they shot a region around a young star 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 where particulate matter is increased by sticking together. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This is the first time that a similar dust trap is clearly visible. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 This solves a long mystery about how dust particles grow in such disks 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 to larger dimensions that eventually form comets, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 planets and other rock bodies. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 This is the transmission of ECO! Science of the highest level and life behind the walls 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 of the European Southern Observatory. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Astronomers already know that there are many planets around other stars. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 But many mysteries remain about how planets, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 comets and asteroids are formed. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 New observations from powerful ALMA telescopes help 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 to answer one of the biggest questions: how small dust particles 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 in the surrounding surroundings of a young star grow - first become debris, 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and then even stones over one meter in diameter? 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 A computer model advises that dust particles grow like 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 collide and stick together. However, when the larger particles collide again 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 with high speed, they often break their constituent particles. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Even if they do not break, the model shows that the larger particles 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 would be delayed due to the friction between dust and gas, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 possibly falling on the star without a chance to continue to form. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Somehow, small rocks need a secure place where they can continue to form 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 to grow while they are big enough to survive alone. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 A similar powder trap was proposed but never observed - until now. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Astronomers used ALMA to study a planetary disc 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 in a system called Oph-IRS 48. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 This system is surrounded by a ring gas with a central hole that was 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 probably cleared on an unseen planet or a partner star. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Earlier observations with ESO's Very Large Telescope showed that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 smaller dust particles also form a ring. But ALMA's new look 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 revealed that larger dust particles were doing something quite different! 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Instead of the expected ring structure, very pronounced 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 form of nut-cashew was revealed. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 It's a dust trap, a region where larger dust particles are trapped 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 and can grow much larger by colliding and sticking together. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Observations advise that a kind of comet factory, 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 because the particles in this dust trap can grow 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 to the size of a committee, a few centimeters in diameter. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Although at this distance from the star, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 the dust is not expected to form planets in full. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Soon with the incomparable sensitivity and clarity of ALMA, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 you will be able to see dust traps much closer to your star. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Such dust traps would really be swings 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 where planets are born. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 The transmission of ECO was produced by the European Southern Observatory. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 The Atacama Large Millimeter / Submillimeter Network Telescopes (ALMA), an international astronomical facility, is a partnership between Europe, North America and East Asia in partnership with the Republic of Chile. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 ECO, the European Southern Observatory is a supreme international scientific and technological organization in astronomy, designing, building and managing the world's most advanced terrestrial telescopes.
