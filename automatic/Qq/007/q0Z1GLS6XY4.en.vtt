this to model cause of life working

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.580 
this to model cause of life working
excellent<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.420> fact<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.960> working<00:01:55.380> is

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.719 
universal system that do these work with
each<00:04:46.840> other<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.320> like<00:04:47.979> if<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.310> had<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.460> black

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
each other so like if you had a black

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.850 
each other so like if you had a black
magic<00:04:49.150> camera<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.660> see<00:04:50.080> you've<00:04:50.200> got<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.710> this

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
magic camera I see you've got so this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.880 
magic camera I see you've got so this
rod<00:04:51.130> support<00:04:51.640> here<00:04:52.080> they<00:04:53.080> put<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.440> rods<00:04:53.680> and

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
rod support here they put the rods and

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.170 
rod support here they put the rods and
it<00:04:53.950> raises<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.430> camera<00:04:54.760> up<00:04:54.820> because

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
it raises the camera up because

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.390 
it raises the camera up because
obviously<00:04:55.360> if<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.710> lens<00:04:56.890> sticking

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
obviously if you have the lens sticking

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.490 
obviously if you have the lens sticking
out<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.669> would<00:04:57.760> stick<00:04:58.000> below<00:04:58.380> where<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
out it would stick below where the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.750 
out it would stick below where the
camera<00:04:59.800> body<00:04:59.919> would<00:05:00.190> be<00:05:00.280> so<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.520> need<00:05:00.669> to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
camera body would be so you need to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.840 
camera body would be so you need to
raise<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.150> up<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.419> that<00:05:01.450> with<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.850> this

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
raise it up like that with this this

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.870 
raise it up like that with this this
