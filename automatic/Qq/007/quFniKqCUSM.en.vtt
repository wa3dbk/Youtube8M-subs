00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello beauty guys plus one episode here 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.349
 blood sweat and photos sorry there that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'm wearing a cap because I'm 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.240
 bald and for those who do not know that I am 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.009
 bald 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
 watch the video there that I shaved the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.699
 hair you will understand why but 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.539
 I did not come here to talk about this, I came 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.150
 here to talk about 35mm to 50mm am 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.670
 or in the case of the one who uses cannon 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.099
 the 28 minimized to 50mm 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.769
 after I did the 35 reviews 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.020
 millimeters of nikon and 50 millimeters 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.239
 There is not a day that I do not receive someone. 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.059
 writing and asking the following to 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 Which of the two do I buy 35mm or 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.980
 at 55 or 50 mm x which of the two is better 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.620
 35mm is 50mm and that's why this video 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.809
 today remembering even if it does not work 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 with neck conquer the canon 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 watch the video that will also serve 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.350
 For you, as long as you have hands 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 similar in the lens of the canon that would 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 50 mm and then I think I have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 28 mm 2.8 a 40 mm 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.680
 so let's go there because it 's having a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.689
 for having another first place we have 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 define the following in terms of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.290
 quality 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 they are basically the same with 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 values ​​I also do not know in case 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 of which I believe there are 28 mm 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.380
 be a little more expensive but at last cost 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 benefit ratio are practically the same 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.930
 thing then what will define if it goes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.960
 buy a lens or other is not in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.329
 question of their quality but the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.020
 What do I mean by that? 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.229
 if I have a full frame camera or a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.630
 sensor camera the pado will make all the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
 difference 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.899
 see if you have a full front camera 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 is putting about 50 mm that would be good 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.909
 she's going to be really 50 minutes into it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.180
 will work as a 50mm if 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 have placed a 35mm 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 it will work with a 35 mm 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.700
 also 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.280
 now if you have a camera with a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 which is most often the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.650
 then 50 millimeters 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 although this is not quite the case. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.439
 without before it begins to criticize but okay 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.189
 it will work as if it were a 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.980
 75 millimeters 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:26.189
 this depends on the crocop of your sensor 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.470
 so I feel like putting 35mm in your 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.129
 sensor camera the blade it will be 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.239
 equivalent to a 50mm lens 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:40.680
 sure this is the main factor said 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.109
 choose another one or 35mm or 50mm 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 because again if you have a camera 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.650
 sensor concerned at 35 millimeters more 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.650
 convert between quotation marks in a 50mm 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.510
 if you put it at 50 mm with your camera it 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.859
 will work as a 75mm beauty 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 That said, now that's a good doubt. 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:08.129
 need a focal length of 50 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.170
 one of 75 mm needs 50 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.599
 then you will have to buy 35 if you need 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.700
 of 75 however will have to buy 50 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 this in case this does not have a frame 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.049
 Right then and there to whom I indicate 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.810
 it is in the case to buy 35 mm that will be the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.299
 the 50's for whom I indicated 50 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.190
 mm that will have the function of 75 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.069
 I think it's easier to start 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.879
 defining for those who would use 75 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.299
 mm 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.540
 in case of 50mm good in case 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.879
 for whoever has the sensor camera 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.790
 priest then I understood 50 millimeters 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.699
 to do portrait photography to be 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.250
 more specific to shoot people 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.290
 because because usually when everything in 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.940
 a focal length greater than the likely 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.349
 the plate to the plans to leave the people 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.510
 another ten days 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.459
 then the 75mm will work 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.190
 very well to do this kind of 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.979
 photography portraits right 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.409
 If you have a full frame I believe 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:10.889
 to 50 millimeters will also be very 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.139
 good because because the 50 mm is that 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.540
 focal length that does not distort anything 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.810
 that comes closest to our eyes 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.299
 from what we are seeing I have 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.729
 about 50 millimeters and I love guessing 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.250
 spectacular also remembering if you do not 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.970
 You know why the 50 mm watch is so cool 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.210
 the video 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.130
 What I already did from the 50m review and even 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.110
 I work with cannon and I talk a lot 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.270
 thing about the focal distance itself that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.670
 does not have much to do with the 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.910
 particular is now for those who want 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.550
 Indicated to 35 millimeters for all 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.220
 those who have a sensor camera 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.070
 priest who the vast majority because she 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.720
 will turn into 50mm and is 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.850
 the land more versatile than who I am 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.770
 I have two cameras a full frame and 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.190
 one of the sensor the priest in my sensor 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.410
 concerned and 95 percent of the time I go 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.140
 to say literally no exaggeration 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.120
 a 35 mm in it because 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.630
 they turned to 50 millimeters 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.430
 As I already said, it 's a very good 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.740
 It's great to have because it's too 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.770
 very versatile camera that can take pictures of 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.770
 landscapes can photograph people can 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.280
 making product pictures is a very 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.740
 good 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.800
 she does not come very close or 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.620
 So much for day to day even if you have 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.500
 a sensor camera the wick okay I 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.990
 I recommend then to 35 millimeters 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.520
 now if you only shoot 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.980
 people portrait 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.720
 so maybe 50mm is better 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.030
 from this you have the sensor camera 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.790
 worried if you have a full frame 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.950
 I think 50mm would be the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.210
 better choice already automatic I do not have 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.000
 Why buy another? 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.000
 despite using 35mm this often in the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.650
 my front and also the only problem 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.169
 only drawback is that sometimes they are 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.169
 the vignettes and dark ones right 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.370
 Good, I do not have much more than talk 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.440
 I think I was very clear in this 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.479
 explanation but in any case if 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.300
 have any doubts, do not hesitate to 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.700
 write there in the comments because I

 I answer to everyone and it will not be 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.130
 the exception 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.830
