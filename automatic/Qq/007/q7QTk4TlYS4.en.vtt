00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
I played Luigi before but I didn't know
like<00:01:47.310> anything<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.820> knew<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> wave<00:01:48.329> -<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like anything I knew how to wave - but I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
like anything I knew how to wave - but I
didn't<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.320> l<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.710> sling<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
didn't know what l can sling was and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.649 
didn't know what l can sling was and
then<00:01:50.970> thankfully<00:01:51.780> Luigi's<00:01:52.380> easy<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.860> wave<00:01:52.979> -

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
then thankfully Luigi's easy to wave -

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.940 
then thankfully Luigi's easy to wave -
well<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.840> hard<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> not

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
well it's hard to get like the not

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.639 
well it's hard to get like the not
really<00:01:56.159> hard<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.840> his<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.990> -<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.500> good

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

us practice I guess and how often would
you<00:02:44.880> say<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.180> play<00:02:45.420> smash<00:02:45.660> how<00:02:45.870> many<00:02:46.019> hours<00:02:46.260> a
