use<00:04:49.220> too<00:04:49.370> much<00:04:49.520> because<00:04:49.820> then<00:04:49.970> you're<00:04:50.090> just

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
use too much because then you're just

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.810 
use too much because then you're just
eating<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.660> soggy<00:04:50.990> popcorn<00:04:51.650> no<00:04:52.550> one<00:04:52.669> likes

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
so the best way to do that would be

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.380 
so the best way to do that would be
through<00:05:46.720> this<00:05:46.840> vessel<00:05:47.230> right<00:05:47.380> here<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:49.180> here's
