00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
experience and whatnot so we're gonna go

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.940 
experience and whatnot so we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:55.750> let<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.020> dry<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.290> about<00:01:56.530> 15-20

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
ahead and let that dry for about 15-20

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.860 
ahead and let that dry for about 15-20
minutes<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:58.330> we're<00:01:58.450> gonna<00:01:58.570> apply<00:01:58.750> the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870

and hit these uh these nooks and
crannies<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.430> these<00:02:54.520> angles<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> lot<00:02:55.120> better

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
crannies and these angles a lot better

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.960 
crannies and these angles a lot better
because<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:56.370> don't<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.490> you<00:02:57.580> can<00:02:57.640> see<00:02:57.790> but

on the sides so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
on the sides so I'm gonna go ahead and
do<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.180> pretty<00:03:01.720> heavily<00:03:01.960> on<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> third<00:03:02.410> coat

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
