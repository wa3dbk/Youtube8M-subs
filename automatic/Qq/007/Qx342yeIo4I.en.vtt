00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.390
 new camoú fable uy I've done it wrong 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.730
 invisible good camouflage what I've done 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.460
 well I do not know it well and it allows you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.230
 camouflage and attack people from 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.580
 inside now you are going to hallucinate with this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 cheat because I've never brought it to the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 channel and well this only works in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.910
 some servers from what I've seen 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.250
 in kuwait kraft does not work very well 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.380
 but let's see what's here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 diamond sword for him for me is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.579
 delicious how bad they have given us 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 blocks I am without armor and blocks of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.489
 all ways well here is a tree and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 I've gotten myself into this map that I 've already 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.460
 brought but I love this map 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.289
 It's super nice when it comes to playing 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 also the chairs are separated 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.079
 that gives me plenty of time to do the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.789
 traps and well look, I wanted to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.260
 come here to I'm going to catch some 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 wood and we're going to make a table 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 character and let's start doing what 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.060
 which is the trap is super easy 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.280
 to see one more worth enough I'm going to 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.290
 polish this and we're going to make a table 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 character or to make a straw and some 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 stairs that is what we are going to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 need to make the trap to see 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.390
 drop it in here, okay, let's do 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.240
 first the ladders and also berries 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.009
 I'm going to do a peak of step to see the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 berries over here and I'm going to make a spike with 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 your permission because if not a peak in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 an ax better because that's how I'm going to go 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 little quicker to see I have no more 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 stone seriously tomorrow its that has happened 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.800
 in this game that we have given blocks 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.970
 how bad that bad fuck could have me 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.619
 given a bit of block look let's go to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 throw away that little goodbye come to fly 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.869
 little one or little one come come that is not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.700
 to catch here stone because I need 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.860
 make an ax to go fast because if 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 I will not take more and step is worth to see 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.119
 around here I hope to win the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.530
 heading also with the trap because what 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.420
 I try in all my games but 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340
 well it does not always come out then you have to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.470
 keep this in mind let's make the ax 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.940
 here it is worth good good we are going to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.159
 decorating this first thing I'm going to remove the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.150
 door because this bothers here this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.650
 It is also being 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.960
 he said okay and now let's do 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.300
 right here on the first floor 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.980

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 I need more blocks please give me 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.340
 it's going to be impossible, my mother what 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.350
 disgusting to see I'll catch some 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.210
 of blocks and we already prepared the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.960
 trap and there are still five people left or 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.050
 there is time 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.450
 this out was well worth then nothing 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.620
 let's do trapped explained vale 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.840
 let's do like a small hall 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.600
 where are we going to go too 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 we'll go through here first, this is worth it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.310
 let's remove and well let's put a 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.020
 corner that is free how is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.880
 perfect you see but I hope to see is already 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.070
 for here first because this I do not want 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.800
 that is free to make it perfect 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.390
 well worth gives me an apple because 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.610
 so now I stay in case well 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.390
 some and well let's put here the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.400
 berries and now or we 're going to get inside 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.070
 of the block and what happens that I from here 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.040
 I can hide and I can also hit 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.900
 throwing lava and that is not only that but 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.030
 that I'm going to put another new invisibility 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.860
 and I have it right now I do not see or god 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.110
 if you notice, I can only hit here 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.880
 I can hide in the square 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.819
 also throw lava, look, I can break 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.859
 here I hide 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.569
 and here I can not hit but here yes 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.920
 then it would be a bit and I'm going to 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.599
 hiding ok I do not know to be able 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.340
 attack and if you want to burn them by the 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.620
 tie is the cube james die a hundred 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.049
 a hundred is worth the cube to have it a little bit 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.849
 hand because if you can not pass some 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.620
 surprise that I caught you from blow and 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.659
 you may not launch what had maps 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.700
 sometime and this would be the trap of today 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.379
 super epic okay let's look for some 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.510

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.450
 someone with this trap we will go up 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.189
 here to see who is left is a good 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.569
 it does not matter what you leave to leave it 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.480
 free because you have to enter first 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.260
 you and where is small where 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.780

 ok it's there underneath 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.450
 then look at other workshops worth not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.300

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.620
 the center and I want to win with this trap 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.630
 Uncle is that it is worth this trap 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.700
 super epic really, that is when I've 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.370
 tried I was amazed you know what 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.230
 I am invisible, nobody sees me, they are 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.639
 hitting milks with walking alive 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.050
 take advantage of making bridge 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.090

 vale vale remains one is supposed if each 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.790

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.500
 fresh chocolate no 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.659
 It's worth what I'm seeing is that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.689
 the pse is very well equipped unlike 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.400
 of it he goes super well equipped look 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.439
 Carlos chapel there I shit in the milk 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 let me go small or small or small no 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:53.659

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.430
 miami to kids who has the bow up 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.380
 of power 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.070
 miami this is going to be very bad now 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.360
 I do not know if the game wins me 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.150
 now let's make a little arrow I'll 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.600
 lower my life a little Miami if you give me 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.430
 it kills me carefully look what happens is that 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.930
 over instead of making the bridge to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.090
 doing something forces me to do it myself 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.920
 because if we would not be here all day 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.840
 I have to beat him uncle but I have to 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.270
 four hearts that comes next that 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.600
 comes out there small or small that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.740
 you are going to catch no no no no no no small 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.140
 quiet quiet, not that I'm 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.220
 recording memento event it's ok I'm not going to 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.800
 win and I tell you this will be 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.590
 impossible if I win like it because this is already 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.190
 a suicide and my mother to a contract 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.190
 hearts what's wrong those who are going to see 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.330
 what comes to me and my beloved mangiafico see 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.360
 here small I love you I love you 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.100
 win is worth if I win thanks to the trap 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.390
 I'm telling you that way , because if I 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.220
 had to face him would kill me 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.840
 what has to come is worth what we are going 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.220
 it is worth notice not realize that 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.820
 I have said that it happens small that you are going to 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.440
 burn 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.910
 ok now what we do is hit 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.860
 as he will not see we're going to put him there 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.870
 or small you want to escape or small or 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.060
 small you are going to lose 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.620
 or small and we won the game you have 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.290
 seen if it's not because of the trap I do not 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.450
 I win it because it was impossible I hope that 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.580
 the point is lay dye is something that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.380
 I ask if you liked punctual like 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.810
 subscribe if you like cheating and 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.820
 above you left an invisible trap in 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.530
 cube craft is worth it if you want to do it in 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.900
 new servers because the one above you 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.000
 all are worth a greeting 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.020
 is the person people drinking like like 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.640
 that you 're not telling me not to 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.260
 they vote like you come back and look for another 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.380
 cow that gives you milk every morning 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.380
 Hey
