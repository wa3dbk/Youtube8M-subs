so<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.600> features<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.929> you<00:01:11.170> may

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so some of the features that you may

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.020 
so some of the features that you may
encounter<00:01:11.740> as<00:01:12.159> you're<00:01:12.310> putting<00:01:12.789> it<00:01:12.909> through

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
encounter as you're putting it through

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.109 
encounter as you're putting it through
its<00:01:13.090> paces<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.740> does<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:15.219> collision<00:01:15.969> warning

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
its paces it does have collision warning

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.719 
its paces it does have collision warning
with<00:01:16.359> brake<00:01:16.659> support<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.799> there's<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.039> radar

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
with brake support so there's a radar

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.490 
with brake support so there's a radar
that's<00:01:18.969> always<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.229> front<00:01:20.439> of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
that's always on in the in the front of

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.260 
that's always on in the in the front of
the<00:01:20.560> car<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.219> is<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.369> like<00:01:21.520> it'll<00:01:21.880> slow<00:01:22.149> it

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
the car so is that like it'll slow it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.330 
the car so is that like it'll slow it
down<00:01:22.329> if<00:01:22.719> you<00:01:22.840> automatically<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:24.069> doesn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
down if you automatically it doesn't

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.830 
down if you automatically it doesn't
intervene<00:01:24.670> unless<00:01:24.909> it's<00:01:25.179> in<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.329> adaptive

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
intervene unless it's in the adaptive

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020 
intervene unless it's in the adaptive
cruise<00:01:26.020> control<00:01:26.079> so<00:01:26.799> what<00:01:27.670> it'll<00:01:27.819> do<00:01:28.000> is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
cruise control so what it'll do is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.459 
cruise control so what it'll do is
there's<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> heads-up<00:01:28.899> display<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.409> the

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
there's a heads-up display in the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.679 
there's a heads-up display in the
windshield<00:01:29.709> so<00:01:30.429> it<00:01:30.459> will<00:01:30.610> flash<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:30.880> bar<00:01:31.299> of<00:01:31.329> red

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
windshield so it will flash a bar of red

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.870 
windshield so it will flash a bar of red
lights<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:32.259> have<00:01:32.409> an<00:01:32.500> audio<00:01:32.770> display<00:01:33.039> at

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
lights and then have an audio display at

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.639 
lights and then have an audio display at
which<00:01:34.119> time<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.539> pre<00:01:34.750> charges<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.259> break<00:01:35.439> so

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
which time it pre charges the break so

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.870 
which time it pre charges the break so
that<00:01:35.679> as<00:01:35.860> soon<00:01:35.950> as<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.159> do<00:01:36.310> intervene<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.789> will

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that as soon as you do intervene it will

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.370 
that as soon as you do intervene it will
react<00:01:37.179> to<00:01:37.390> stop<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.689> card<00:01:37.899> at<00:01:38.049> shorter

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
react to stop the card at shorter

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.669 
react to stop the card at shorter
distance<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.659> now<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.899> put<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.200> manual

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
distance so now if you put it in manual

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.589 
distance so now if you put it in manual
just<00:01:42.039> down<00:01:42.220> yeah<00:01:42.429> it's<00:01:42.640> right<00:01:42.789> off<00:01:42.939> again<00:01:43.209> and

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599
