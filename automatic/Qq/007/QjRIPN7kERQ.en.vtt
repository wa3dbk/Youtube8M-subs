 the manga written by and I was little 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 neighborhood has four volumes 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'll tell you about another recent release today. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.079
 of opti jbc has rating 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.870
 for over 16 years costs 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.370
 13 90 pages of color 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.559
 chubby and that's it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 the cover is attractive the synopsis is also 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.469
 very good and wolley even for you oo 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.079
 game begins when wolf mingles with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 rabbits the man's rabbits and the wolf goes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 to hunt 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.390
 six students find themselves trapped in a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.059
 real version of robert mobile game 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
 taub and now they should guess who the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.979
 The group wolf the enemy is hiding 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 and the penalty for failure is death 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.330
 Well, so I started reading with a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.760
 relatively high expectation 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.130
 because it is a survival genre that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.530
 I quite like pearl royale 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.259
 usually insisted it involves suspense 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.900
 psychological game and seven things that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.150
 well-worked can be sensational 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.799
 however it is very difficult the chances of being 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 weak are also large 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.509
 the first chapter began quite 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.400
 a somewhat confused presentation of the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 characters from nowhere they meet 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.610
 to play a game but most do not even 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 knows 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.020
 there are several dialogues, which 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 that the fish is a bit slow on the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.180
 Traced I found that I do not have a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 originality that very standard thing 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.140
 which is not ugly but does not have a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.939
 large differential 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 then there is a major turnaround in the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.090
 end of the first chapter 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.130
 we still had practically no 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.950
 no coherence with the fact that people 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 strangers meet in person and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 already be intimate about the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 sequence sometimes some scene jumps 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 it seems that missing frames is something that I 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 I never saw any manga and it breaks a 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.720
 the reading fluency because the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 feeling that something is missing 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.940
 anyway, someone with a mask of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.520
 rabbit head makes everyone faint 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.560
 and leads them to a mysterious place with 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.650
 several locked doors 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.260
 altogether there are at least seven people in a 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.020
 first moment one of them is dead and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.610
 then there is the mystery of who the wolf is 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.600
 Who killed this crazy person? 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.910
 impossible not to make associations with 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.220
 games is obvious but the rules 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.830
 different and the game insisted 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.110
 originals until I've at least never seen 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.000
 nowhere else 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.010
 Let's make some compliments right now. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 at least in the preliminaries the author already 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.240
 plant some suspicions in some 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 characters is a delinquent is what 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.380
 was meeting a neurotic girl at the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.870
 protagonist who did not even remember 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.550
 sent a message from the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.280
 start you have reason to consider 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.600
 any of the six guilty of death 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 person's 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.740
 the protagonist at least at the beginning and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.050
 proves to be those protagonists 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.740
 jesus who are the nicest guys in 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.200
 world 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.290
 the type of character and I really want 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.570
 much the same that they fuck if I go 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.100
 continue to buy the annus I'll read 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.140
 tout honestly I do not know until 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.870
 I'm just curious to know 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.000
 How will the issues develop? 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.380
 psychological this mystery to know who 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.390
 I killed 1390 but I do not know. 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.250
 which are only four volumes 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.690
 I'll give one a thought there, I found 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.970
 I do not know what I found better ft 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.470
 discussed soldiers in fact I did not 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.709
 I found none of the two sensational 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.720
 sincerely every case I am of those 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.860
 that sometimes hit the bank and I get 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.340
 willingness to buy 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.530
 Maybe I'll thank you very much. 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.360
 everyone who watched the video still played 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.360
 but they went out not
