we're<00:03:04.040> looking<00:03:04.250> forward<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.660> TM<00:03:06.019> has

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
we're looking forward I think I TM has

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.819 
we're looking forward I think I TM has
got<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> great<00:03:07.190> potential<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:08.239> Germany<00:03:09.110> because

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
got a great potential in Germany because

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.490 
got a great potential in Germany because
we<00:03:10.160> need<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> future<00:03:11.260> technologies<00:03:12.260> we

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
we need for the future technologies we

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400 
we need for the future technologies we
need<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:13.010> very<00:03:13.670> clean<00:03:14.000> hydrogen<00:03:14.660> I'm<00:03:15.349> very

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
need a very clean hydrogen I'm very

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.220 
need a very clean hydrogen I'm very
impressed<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.790> think<00:03:17.329> there<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:18.019> been

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
impressed that I think there have been

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.160 
impressed that I think there have been
some<00:03:18.709> some<00:03:19.130> improvements<00:03:19.940> since<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.989> last

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
some some improvements since the last

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.129 
some some improvements since the last
year<00:03:21.440> when<00:03:21.709> we<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:22.010> been<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:23.900> think

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
year when we have been here and I think

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.110 
year when we have been here and I think
if<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.470> continues<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.519> way<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:26.090> can

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
if it continues in this way we can

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.589 
if it continues in this way we can
really<00:03:26.989> be<00:03:27.590> happy<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:29.120> look<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.569> future

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
really be happy to look to the future

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.930 
really be happy to look to the future
what<00:03:30.200> will<00:03:30.500> be<00:03:30.769> happening<00:03:30.859> on<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.310> sector<00:03:31.670> I

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
what will be happening on the sector I

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.270 
what will be happening on the sector I
think<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.780> people<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.200> work<00:03:33.380> for<00:03:33.410> itm<00:03:33.920> power

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
think the people that work for itm power

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.129 
think the people that work for itm power
should<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:34.940> very<00:03:35.269> proud<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.930> progress

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
should be very proud of the progress

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.440 
should be very proud of the progress
that's<00:03:36.440> been<00:03:36.620> made<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:37.040> recent<00:03:37.220> months<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:38.000> I

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that's been made in recent months and I

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.170 
that's been made in recent months and I
think<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.200> response<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.489> we've<00:03:40.730> received

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
think the response that we've received

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.030 
think the response that we've received
from<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.660> industry<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.440> potential

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
from the industry and potential

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.220 
from the industry and potential
customers<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.669> very<00:03:43.910> very<00:03:44.060> strong<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.750> that's

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
customers is very very strong and that's

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.330 
customers is very very strong and that's
evidence<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.980> we're<00:03:46.160> developing

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
evidence that we're developing

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.159 
evidence that we're developing
technology<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.419> right<00:03:47.569> space<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:48.139> the

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
technology in the right space at the

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:58.670 
technology in the right space at the
right<00:03:48.380> time

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.739
