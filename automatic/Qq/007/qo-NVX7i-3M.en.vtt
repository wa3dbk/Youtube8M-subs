00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.860
 I went there but still 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.910
 It is a city ​​that has not been recovered 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.280
 The people of Fukushima don't use the word recovery, but rather 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 I would like to have that kind of feels like I mean or say that earns new reconstruction 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.560

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:25.060
