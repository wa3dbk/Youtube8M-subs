00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
Blackmagic Design we can see it's HDMI

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.370 
Blackmagic Design we can see it's HDMI
video<00:00:22.970> output<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.150> we<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> HDMI

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
video output and we can see the HDMI

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.560 
video output and we can see the HDMI
cords<00:00:28.830> kept<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> Blackmagic

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
cords kept going into the Blackmagic
into<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> HDMI<00:00:31.740> IN<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.320> it's<00:00:34.320> coming<00:00:34.680> out

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
into the HDMI IN and it's coming out

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
into the HDMI IN and it's coming out
from<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> other<00:00:35.370> laptop<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.180> using<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
from the other laptop here using a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
from the other laptop here using a
software<00:00:37.559> called<00:00:37.680> resolve<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.570> go

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
software called resolve you and if we go

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830 
software called resolve you and if we go
to<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.050> output<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> display<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to the output we can see the display is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
to the output we can see the display is
set<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:44.090> 1080<00:00:47.030> 1080<00:00:48.030> pixels<00:00:48.870> 1080<00:00:49.590> pixels<00:00:50.420> yeah

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
set at 1080 1080 pixels 1080 pixels yeah

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.439 
set at 1080 1080 pixels 1080 pixels yeah
deep<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.129> thing<00:00:53.460> okay<00:00:53.730> yeah

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
deep which is the right thing okay yeah

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.900 
deep which is the right thing okay yeah
and<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.590> should<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.920> outputting<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> signal

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and that should be outputting a signal

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
and that should be outputting a signal
because<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> second

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
because it can see that there's a second

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.939 
because it can see that there's a second
monitor<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:03.420> mean<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.960> argument's<00:01:04.439> sake<00:01:04.589> jacks

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
monitor I mean for argument's sake jacks

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
monitor I mean for argument's sake jacks
just<00:01:05.129> pull<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:06.049> output<00:01:07.049> cable<00:01:07.619> there

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
just pull out your output cable there

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.910 
just pull out your output cable there
your<00:01:08.130> HDMI<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.810> Rizzo<00:01:10.140> Liam<00:01:10.350> tells<00:01:10.650> us

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
your HDMI and see if Rizzo Liam tells us

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.270 
your HDMI and see if Rizzo Liam tells us
that<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.280> any<00:01:11.549> output<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.659> then

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
that there is any output to be had then

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
that there is any output to be had then
what<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> say<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> there

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what does it say I'm just put it there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
is seeing that there is a display then

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.590 
is seeing that there is a display then

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so yeah so this from this side

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
so yeah so this from this side
everything<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.079> working<00:01:43.430> yet<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> come

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
everything should be working yet I come

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
everything should be working yet I come
around<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.299> side<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> log<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
around to this side for the log and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
around to this side for the log and
capture<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.970> media<00:01:48.420> Express<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.130> 0<00:01:50.570> ok

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
capture in media Express and we get 0 ok

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.490 
capture in media Express and we get 0 ok
so<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:53.490> know<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> problem<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so I know it's not a problem like you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.080 
so I know it's not a problem like you
have<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> problem<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> hardware<00:01:56.670> but

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
have a problem with the hardware but

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 
have a problem with the hardware but
hopefully<00:01:57.600> because<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:59.159> other<00:01:59.340> things

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
hopefully because there's other things

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580 
hopefully because there's other things
that<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.659> mean<00:02:01.110> we've<00:02:01.439> got

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that this can do I mean we've got

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
that this can do I mean we've got
another<00:02:01.860> camera<00:02:02.250> panasonic<00:02:02.820> camera<00:02:03.450> over

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
another camera panasonic camera over

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.469 
another camera panasonic camera over
here<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.140> instance<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> first

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
here for instance and that was the first

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.729 
here for instance and that was the first
thing<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.780> tested<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.590> using<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.729> composite

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
thing I tested it on using the composite

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
thing I tested it on using the composite
inputs<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> signal<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.480> from

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
inputs and we can get a signal from from

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.740 
inputs and we can get a signal from from
this<00:02:13.170> are<00:02:13.380> based<00:02:13.740> no<00:02:14.550> problem<00:02:15.120> from<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> old

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this are based no problem from this old

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.420 
this are based no problem from this old
camera<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:16.950> great

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
camera so that's great

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.760 
camera so that's great
and<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.570> explained<00:02:19.020> before<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.740> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and as I explained before I can get a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.430 
and as I explained before I can get a
