00:00:01.247 --> 00:00:08.277
 I never thought about going again. 

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:11.069
 Making a Lange watch 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.923
 I am old, I didn’t think I could live to it. 

00:00:14.043 --> 00:00:15.573
 Witness the moment of German unification 

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:20.653
 Lange’s vision is only feasible in the town of Glashütte 

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.670
 Can't be set anywhere else 

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:37.998
 Then, the German reunification suddenly happened. 

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:43.004
 I thought at the time: "What about the town of Glashütte?" 

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.955
 This is my main concern 

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.145
 I value the town of Glashütte. 

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.359
 We have a concept 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.734
 I re-register for the company in the business registry 

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:12.248
 I chose it on December 7, 1990, shortly after the reunification of Germany. 

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:16.993
 My great-grandfather on December 7, 1845 

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:20.380
 Start a business 

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:27.013
 I didn't plan at the time. 

00:01:27.694 --> 00:01:37.194
 The date is fixed, but I don't know if it is the day of the week. 

00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:47.245
 In short, the two messengers went to the District Court. 

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:51.309
 Register for company 

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:57.259
 They drove to Dresden to find the courthouse 

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:06.675
 The day is Friday, the time has passed noon. 

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:12.625
 The gate of the courthouse is locked 

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:18.514
 But they are very lucky 

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.940
 They pass the glass on the door 

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.965
 Seeing the cleaning lady on duty 

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:31.424
 So knock hard 

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.958
 If it is today, this is not feasible. 

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:41.170
 The foreman came and opened the door with the key to let the two go in. 

00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:46.195
 The lady responsible for stamping is still 

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:51.872
 She stamped the envelope with "December 7th" 

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:54.353
 a good adventure
