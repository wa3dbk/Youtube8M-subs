00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.990 
c-calm with a quick review of the
Traxxas<00:00:10.400> 1/16<00:00:11.400> scale<00:00:11.490> Boss<00:00:12.389> 302<00:00:13.259> Mustang<00:00:13.980> RTR

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Traxxas 1/16 scale Boss 302 Mustang RTR

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.140 
Traxxas 1/16 scale Boss 302 Mustang RTR
and<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.719> call<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.160> 1/16<00:00:17.160> scale<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.940> in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and I call this 1/16 scale but in

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.630 
and I call this 1/16 scale but in
reality<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.320> actually<00:00:19.830> bigger<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
reality it's actually bigger than that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.929 
reality it's actually bigger than that
this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.090> closer<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.920> 1/12<00:00:22.920> scale<00:00:23.100> vehicle

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this is closer to a 1/12 scale vehicle

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
this is closer to a 1/12 scale vehicle
the<00:00:24.420> reason<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:24.960> call<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.439> 1/16<00:00:26.310> scale

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the reason that they call it 1/16 scale

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
the reason that they call it 1/16 scale
is<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> chassis<00:00:28.380> that's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
is just because of the chassis that's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.490 
is just because of the chassis that's
based<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.060> originally<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> 1/16

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
based on it was originally the 1/16

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.250 
based on it was originally the 1/16
scale<00:00:31.590> mini<00:00:32.219> ear<00:00:32.550> Evo<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.719> convert<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> over

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
scale mini ear Evo to convert it over

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
scale mini ear Evo to convert it over
for<00:00:34.710> on-road<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.640> put<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> mini<00:00:36.239> slash

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
for on-road use they put the mini slash

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.860 
for on-road use they put the mini slash
4x4<00:00:37.710> arms<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.629> wide

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
4x4 arms on it to make it not as wide

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
4x4 arms on it to make it not as wide
then<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.620> also<00:00:40.739> changed<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> shocks<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
then they also changed up the shocks the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170 
then they also changed up the shocks the
shocks<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.960> much<00:00:43.410> shorter<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.280> ours<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
shocks here are much shorter as ours the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
shocks here are much shorter as ours the
spring<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.020> doesn't<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.350> nearly<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:47.010> much

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
spring so it doesn't have nearly as much

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
spring so it doesn't have nearly as much
suspension<00:00:48.120> travel<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> original

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
suspension travel as the original

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
suspension travel as the original
off-road<00:00:50.100> version<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> still<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.329> way

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
off-road version but it still has way

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
off-road version but it still has way
more<00:00:51.660> travel<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> standard<00:00:53.100> on-road<00:00:53.610> car

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
more travel than a standard on-road car

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
more travel than a standard on-road car

into a drift pretty easily and I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.370 
were not consistent in turns however you
can<00:04:01.980> fix<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.640> by<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:03.300> changing<00:04:03.660> out<00:04:04.020> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
can fix that by just changing out the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.830 
can fix that by just changing out the
tires<00:04:04.830> themselves<00:04:05.100> what<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.240> isn't<00:04:06.720> going

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
tires themselves what that isn't going

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.260 
tires themselves what that isn't going
to<00:04:06.900> fix<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.350> all<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.800> body<00:04:08.130> roll<00:04:08.459> when<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
to fix is all that body roll when the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.780 
to fix is all that body roll when the
vehicle<00:04:09.720> rolls<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.440> much<00:04:10.680> it's<00:04:10.950> not<00:04:11.190> just<00:04:11.640> to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
vehicle rolls that much it's not just to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.970 
vehicle rolls that much it's not just to
the<00:04:11.940> body<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.720> chassis<00:04:13.170> itself<00:04:13.590> it's

steer or push interns which you need to

counteract by getting on the brakes a
little<00:04:31.870> bit<00:04:32.020> once<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.800> do<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.159> it<00:04:33.400> makes<00:04:33.580> the

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
little bit once you do that it makes the

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.269 
little bit once you do that it makes the
rear-end<00:04:34.330> want<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.050> start<00:04:35.319> to<00:04:35.439> kick<00:04:35.710> out<00:04:35.919> and

rear-end want to start to kick out and

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.309 
rear-end want to start to kick out and
that's<00:04:36.520> where<00:04:36.729> you<00:04:36.849> start<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.539> initiate<00:04:37.810> just

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
that's where you start to initiate just

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.649 
that's where you start to initiate just
a<00:04:38.409> little<00:04:38.710> bit<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:38.949> a<00:04:39.009> drift<00:04:39.400> at<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:40.300> point

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
a little bit of a drift at that point

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.019 
a little bit of a drift at that point
it's<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.110> doing<00:04:41.409> a<00:04:41.650> tightrope<00:04:42.219> walk<00:04:42.520> you

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
it's like doing a tightrope walk you

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.610 
it's like doing a tightrope walk you
have<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.270> be<00:04:43.360> very<00:04:43.719> careful<00:04:44.229> with<00:04:44.349> your

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
have to be very careful with your

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.920 
have to be very careful with your
steering<00:04:45.039> input<00:04:45.580> your<00:04:45.909> corrections<00:04:46.539> as<00:04:46.719> well

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
steering input your corrections as well

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.230 
steering input your corrections as well
as<00:04:47.139> your<00:04:47.349> throttle<00:04:47.889> input<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.699> try<00:04:48.909> to<00:04:48.969> write

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
as your throttle input to try to write

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.629 
as your throttle input to try to write
it<00:04:49.389> right<00:04:49.779> along<00:04:50.289> that<00:04:50.560> line<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.249> it<00:04:51.340> doesn't

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
it right along that line so it doesn't

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.999 
it right along that line so it doesn't
actually<00:04:51.969> spin<00:04:52.479> out<00:04:52.689> on<00:04:52.719> you<00:04:53.050> it's<00:04:53.379> definitely

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
actually spin out on you it's definitely

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.939 
actually spin out on you it's definitely
a<00:04:54.039> challenge<00:04:54.669> but<00:04:54.939> it<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.210> very<00:04:55.629> enjoyable

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
a challenge but it is a very enjoyable

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.140 
a challenge but it is a very enjoyable
challenge<00:04:56.949> as<00:04:57.099> long<00:04:57.310> as<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.550> don't<00:04:57.699> expect

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150

take it over jumps but see here this is
the<00:05:33.400> brilliant<00:05:33.849> thing<00:05:34.180> about<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.750> way<00:05:34.900> that

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
the brilliant thing about the way that

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.019 
the brilliant thing about the way that
this<00:05:35.319> car<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.800> set<00:05:36.069> up<00:05:36.219> because<00:05:36.669> the

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
this car is set up because the

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.029 
this car is set up because the
suspension<00:05:37.419> is<00:05:37.719> so<00:05:37.930> soft<00:05:38.319> and<00:05:38.500> has<00:05:38.710> so<00:05:38.919> much

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
suspension is so soft and has so much

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.029 
suspension is so soft and has so much
travel<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.759> can<00:05:39.819> handle<00:05:40.419> bumpy<00:05:41.379> textured

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
travel it can handle bumpy textured

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.969 
travel it can handle bumpy textured
surfaces<00:05:42.729> without<00:05:43.300> getting<00:05:43.839> all<00:05:44.050> upset<00:05:44.500> and
