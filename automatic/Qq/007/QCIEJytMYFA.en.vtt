00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello I will show you how we 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 made to repair a gas gauge 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.160
 on a tea krp days that's see the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.910
 contact is put the gauge to no 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 does not work there the gas gauge 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 she has here you disconnect the little one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.250
 cable here you cut a little bit of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.720
 cap that you put back on it and there 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 you will see the relationship what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.969
 works I remove it and go back down I 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.770
 the put back a run 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.420
 that is what my beam 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.890
 electric works well if he wants 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 to say that this is the problem of the gauge to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 gasoline 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.000
 then we take off here we put two ends 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 of wire here we do a quarter turn 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.469
 here is the road to the famous gauge 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 with gasoline then what happens is 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.909
 it is of the essence to calamine 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.159
 put it on here see calamine 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.520
 you take a piece of paper from 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 glass you think a little bit in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 paying attention to small slats to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 peace does not get too close to this convoy 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 thanks to a little bit we scratch a little 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 little also there we paid attention 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.759
 always for small slats here and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.310
 trying to put a little bit on 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.310
 sweat lamella 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:45.549
 attention to the joints it's not easy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.960
 we will try to pass something 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:55.960
 yeah that's all the calamine that's 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 here what is it to take a small 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:11.410
 effort lift all the green that is on it 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.069
 Russia and scratch a little bit 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.530
 remove the mayor but hey should 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:24.100
 take a small screwdriver with a 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.269
 little spoon we'll see well see all 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:36.350
 all the green that comes out there must scratch there 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:44.440
 above it is the calamine of lead 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.440
 are for doing their essence has 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.100
 scratched one too 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.260
 it would also put some in 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:14.470
 sudan slats dude you will not be 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:24.900
 obvious to scratch a little slat with 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:24.900
 a little bit of trying to do the other way 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.739
 it was crater policy 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:04:21.970
 form and where the verb but hey it's true 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:24.880
 it's not obvious here we scratched at 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:32.620
 maximum now lifted the cure for 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:38.190
 see if it works for support 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.190
 offered a quarter turn and one plugs it 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:50.770
 and the recent addition is working 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.210
 I hope it will serve you or 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.210
 help people here thank you
