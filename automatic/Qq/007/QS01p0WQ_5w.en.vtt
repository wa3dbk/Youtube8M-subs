00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 good day dear friends with you i 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.780
 Sergey for the longest liters all not 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.759
 I want to introduce you to several 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.210
 accessories for sony z3 tablet 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.160
 compact branded accessories 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.670
 production is also the company sony 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.470
 The case is a protective film on the screen and 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.100
 docking station you start cover means covers 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.899
 just appeared on sale in Russia by 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 the price is somewhere around two thousand rubles 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 they are available on preorders but in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.739
 In principle, I think soon they will appear 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.980
 wide sale what is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.940
 Case is such a plastic 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.940
 foundation and 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 mediocre cover 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 about any skin out of ten can not speak 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 it is a bit like a cover from 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.479
 e-books savannah that is 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 some kind of semi rubber leatherette 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 I do not know exactly rubber inside 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.490
 why this particular cover reading the forums 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.970
 I noticed that all the people who 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.900
 bought covers for exactly z3 compact 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.189
 third-party covers good 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.540
 but almost none of them 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.619
 supported 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 sleep function ie when closing the lid 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 the screen to incarnate does not go out and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.509
 Accordingly, when you open the lid, it does not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.119
 lights up well it's not quite comfortable 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.979
 so I decided to wait 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.049
 original case which principle 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 lets it did it inserted here 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.020
 so here is the upper and lower bound attached 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.770
 in a case 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.340
 Now it looks like that is open 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:20.160
 cover screen lights up close it 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.690
 extinguishes the principle all pretty comfortable 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.460
 Bottom part 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.790
 almost everything is closed except 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.160
 plugs the upper part to close completely 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.290
 this side is where the power button 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.010
 fully open power button 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.630
 slightly bulges but when closed 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.220
 the cover of this button is not on 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:52.710
 It works, that is, the screen does not light up 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.360
 the battery doesn't waste everything here smoothly 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.010
 cutout under 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.960
 so there is no magnetic connector 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.180
 dock you will have to use 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.170
 open the case to insert 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 for ease of use docking station 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 the plastic base is made to such a floor 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.750
 oval cut so as not to increase 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:21.130
 dimensions tablet thickness for 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.709
 use on so much in the form of a desktop 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.290
 stand this is happening here like this 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.940
 that's not quite solid but in principle 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.480
 put to watch a movie there to look through 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.480
 something is quite possible like this 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.840
 In principle, the cover is pretty light 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.390
 dimensions too 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.120
 the tablet practically does not increase in 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.569
 This plan does not have any complaints 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.510
 as for durability, bye 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.470
 what is difficult to say here already shows 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.540
 only time since we mentioned 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.330
 docking stations let's look at read 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.430
 the docking station was a gift to the tablet 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:19.370
 wildly 39 which was produced produced 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.190
 For the z2 tablet, the principle of the sticker can be 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.889
 judge that soni claims that this 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:31.729
 fully compatible z3 tablet 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:39.380
 but also its nuances here it is our dock 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:44.600
 station you are just a plastic base 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:48.199
 where to plug the standard cable 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.020
 micro usb which included a 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.389
 tablet and, accordingly, will need 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:59.810
 power adapter from the same kit and 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:06.289
 there is only one insertion means if we 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:11.500
 insert tablet docking station that's all 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:14.240
 good but the thickness of the tablet is more than 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.389
 insert so vocals well so here 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:27.470
 a little walks he keeps securely but also 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:32.570
 days at last it will fall nothing much 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:38.150
 no critical but still mean you can 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:40.940
 insert in the case into the docking station of the tablet 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.520
 thus folding the lid back or 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.150
 if you can try a little cover 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.979
 fill in this way and here 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.979
 bought from you will stand 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:07.580
 everything is pretty convenient if not 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:10.910
 to take into account some but not the last 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.449
 know and accessories as you can call 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.060
 branded sony film on the screen for again 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:20.770
 same z3 tablet 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:24.010
 the film is already glued 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:29.599
 fairly good quality semi glossy 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:36.039
 with reminded me of the film spa genes 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:39.529
 and ultra more precisely ultra optics which 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:43.249
 Here they were different in that 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.429
 did not give screen granularity due 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:49.759
 haze but at the same time removed 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:53.919
 glare in contrast to pure glossy 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.659
 fingerprint protection films 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:02.149
 present may not be like on 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:05.379
 after all, the sony screen itself 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:08.419
 stains remain but they are easily removed 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:11.389
 and unlike cheap films 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.939
 really good quality film 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:17.439
 it is worth less than 500 rubles so 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:21.489
 I can safely recommend the film 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:26.809
 docking stations if you need too quite 

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:30.049
 Fits but considering the fact that the tablet is not 

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:33.019
 slightly swinging as for 

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:35.259
 cover not if you really need 

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:38.599
 very thin such case 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:41.329
 easy one yes if you want some 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:44.869
 more serious skin on something else too 

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:45.949
 need to look covers from third-party 

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:50.229
 manufacturers 

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:50.229
 well thank you for your attention goodbye
