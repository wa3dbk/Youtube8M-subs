but<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.930> bit<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.290> heals<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> take

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but a little bit it heals so if you take

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.770 
but a little bit it heals so if you take
a<00:01:56.369> key<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:56.909> screen<00:01:57.299> she'll<00:01:57.479> give<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
couple days and it will be gone you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
couple days and it will be gone you
don't<00:02:00.180> even<00:02:00.270> notice<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.290> there

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

don't even notice and so for that there
are<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> lot<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:01.829> resilient<00:02:02.579> however<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.390> don't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
are a lot more resilient however I don't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.380 
are a lot more resilient however I don't
think<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> optical<00:02:04.710> clarity<00:02:04.950> on
