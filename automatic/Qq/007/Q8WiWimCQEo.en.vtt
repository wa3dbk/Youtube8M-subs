and we usually do at least for our

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.870 
and we usually do at least for our
blender<00:01:16.410> that<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.160> 2<00:01:17.430> cups<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
blender that we have about 2 cups at a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
blender that we have about 2 cups at a
time<00:01:18.120> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> easily<00:01:19.230> measure<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.800> on<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
time you can easily measure this on the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.040 
time you can easily measure this on the
outside<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.910> blender<00:01:23.910> has<00:01:24.150> some

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
outside of the blender has some

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.410 
outside of the blender has some
measuring<00:01:25.800> bits<00:01:25.980> here<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
measuring bits here and you can see that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.230 
measuring bits here and you can see that
mark<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:34.050> once<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.260> gets<00:01:34.530> filled<00:01:34.800> up

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
mark and then once that gets filled up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.150 
mark and then once that gets filled up
put<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.300> top<00:01:36.480> on<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.410> usually<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> at

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
put the top on and will usually do it at

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.890 
put the top on and will usually do it at
least<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> Blendtec<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.390> model<00:01:39.600> will

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
least the Blendtec and this model will

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
least the Blendtec and this model will
blend<00:01:40.260> for<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.530> 50<00:01:41.070> seconds<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.550> time<00:01:41.610> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
blend for about 50 seconds at a time so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.000 
blend for about 50 seconds at a time so
we'll<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.300> two<00:01:42.960> cycles<00:01:43.410> we'll<00:01:43.650> do<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> first

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
we'll do two cycles we'll do the first

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.980 
we'll do two cycles we'll do the first
at<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.460> low<00:01:44.730> speed<00:01:44.760> cycle<00:01:45.510> and<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.810> kind

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
at a very low speed cycle and just kind

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.110 
at a very low speed cycle and just kind
of<00:01:46.050> get<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.830> we'll<00:01:47.490> stop<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
of get it going and then we'll stop it

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.000 
of get it going and then we'll stop it
kind<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.870> scrape<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.380> sides<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> get

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
kind of scrape down the sides and get

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.350 
kind of scrape down the sides and get
everything<00:01:50.220> remixed<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.910> then<00:01:51.030> we'll<00:01:51.180> kind

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
everything remixed and then we'll kind

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
everything remixed and then we'll kind
of<00:01:51.510> bump<00:01:51.660> up<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> speed<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.230> medium<00:01:52.800> high

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
of bump up the speed to medium high

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.890 
of bump up the speed to medium high
setting<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.550> then<00:01:54.120> finish<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.510> out<00:01:54.750> from

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
setting and then finish it out from

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.140 
setting and then finish it out from
there<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.440> we'll<00:01:56.010> save<00:01:56.190> your<00:01:56.310> limbs<00:01:56.730> here<00:01:56.970> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
there so we'll save your limbs here and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.890 
there so we'll save your limbs here and
do<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> first

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.000 

all<00:02:02.900> right<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:03.229> we've<00:02:03.409> done<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.740> through<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
all right so now we've done it through a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.040 
all right so now we've done it through a
blended<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.520> at<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.820> first<00:02:05.000> first<00:02:05.750> round<00:02:05.960> of

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
blended it at the first first round of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.240 
blended it at the first first round of
illicit<00:02:06.350> beat<00:02:06.470> setting<00:02:06.830> you'll<00:02:07.010> see<00:02:07.130> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
illicit beat setting you'll see that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.150 
illicit beat setting you'll see that
most<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.729> Fox<00:02:07.970> meal<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.330> broken<00:02:08.570> up<00:02:08.780> but

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
most of the Fox meal is broken up but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440 
most of the Fox meal is broken up but
not<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> whole<00:02:10.580> lot<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.150> we're<00:02:11.300> going<00:02:11.420> to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
not a whole lot so what we're going to

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.180 
not a whole lot so what we're going to
do<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.840> kind<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.140> scrape<00:02:12.680> around<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
do is just kind of scrape around the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.770 
do is just kind of scrape around the
side<00:02:13.400> sometimes<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> corners<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
side sometimes in the corners of the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 
side sometimes in the corners of the
blenders<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.380> some<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> finer<00:02:16.610> grounds

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
blenders the some of the finer grounds

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.310 
blenders the some of the finer grounds
will<00:02:17.209> get<00:02:17.360> caught<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.080> want<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.230> either

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
will get caught you just want to either

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.650 
will get caught you just want to either
then<00:02:18.620> kind<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.070> mix<00:02:19.760> after<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.270> having<00:02:20.510> one

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
then kind of mix after it's having one

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.270 
then kind of mix after it's having one
chance<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.110> go<00:02:21.230> through<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.040> we'll<00:02:22.160> go

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
chance to go through and then we'll go

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.300 
chance to go through and then we'll go
to<00:02:22.310> bump<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> higher<00:02:23.270> speed<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
to bump it up at a higher speed and that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.140 
to bump it up at a higher speed and that
should<00:02:25.459> be<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
should be it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
should be it
the<00:02:26.420> one<00:02:26.690> important<00:02:27.080> note<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> make<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.680> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the one important note to make is that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.070 
the one important note to make is that
when<00:02:28.130> you're<00:02:28.370> blending<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.300> Fox<00:02:29.540> meal<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.900> home

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
when you're blending on Fox meal at home

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.330 
when you're blending on Fox meal at home
these<00:02:30.320> blenders<00:02:30.590> can't<00:02:30.890> create<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.190> lot<00:02:31.310> of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
these blenders can't create a lot of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.880 
these blenders can't create a lot of
friction<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.940> increase<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.900> heat<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.680> that's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
friction and increase the heat so that's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.199 
friction and increase the heat so that's
why<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.190> always<00:02:34.400> want<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.700> use<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> lowest

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
why we always want to use the lowest

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.670 
why we always want to use the lowest
setting<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.410> will<00:02:36.530> get

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
setting that we can that will get

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.630 
setting that we can that will get
everything<00:02:37.330> ground<00:02:38.330> out<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.930> point<00:02:39.200> that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
everything ground out to the point that

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.220 
everything ground out to the point that
these<00:02:40.640> will<00:02:40.850> be<00:02:40.970> able<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.209> be<00:02:41.300> absorbed<00:02:41.390> in

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
these will be able to be absorbed in

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.720 
these will be able to be absorbed in
your<00:02:42.380> intestinal<00:02:42.739> tract<00:02:43.010> otherwise<00:02:43.400> if

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
your intestinal tract otherwise if

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.020 
your intestinal tract otherwise if
they're<00:02:43.940> still<00:02:44.209> left<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.600> their<00:02:44.720> natural<00:02:45.680> hole

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
they're still left in their natural hole

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.640 
they're still left in their natural hole
seafood<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.390> your<00:02:48.020> body<00:02:48.170> won't<00:02:48.320> be<00:02:48.410> able<00:02:48.470> to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
seafood and your body won't be able to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.990 
seafood and your body won't be able to
process<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.459> kind<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.820> goes

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
process it and it just kind of goes

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.979 
process it and it just kind of goes
right<00:02:50.239> through<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.630> don't<00:02:50.720> get<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
right through and you don't get the

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.600 
right through and you don't get the
benefits<00:02:51.350> from<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:51.890> we'll<00:02:52.340> go<00:02:52.430> ahead<00:02:52.519> and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
benefits from it so we'll go ahead and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.340 
benefits from it so we'll go ahead and
blend<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.239> through<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> second<00:02:53.989> time<00:02:54.110> on<00:02:54.290> a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
blend it through here a second time on a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.229 
blend it through here a second time on a
more<00:02:54.650> medium<00:02:55.010> setting<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.640> we'll<00:02:56.000> show<00:02:56.209> you

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
more medium setting and we'll show you

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.060 
more medium setting and we'll show you
how<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.450> looks<00:02:56.720> here<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.140> say<00:02:57.290> all

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
how that looks here just to say all

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.050 
how that looks here just to say all

home just for your reference to the
first<00:03:05.540> round<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:05.959> used<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.380> speed<00:03:06.709> one<00:03:06.950> setting

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
first round we used a speed one setting

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.710 
first round we used a speed one setting
in<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.610> second<00:03:07.910> round<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.180> used<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.450> third

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
in the second round we used a third

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.920 
in the second round we used a third
setting<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.519> kind<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.760> gets<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.150> flax

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
setting and it kind of gets the flax

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.580 
setting and it kind of gets the flax
meal

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
meal

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.140 
meal
finally<00:03:13.220> ground<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:13.610> as<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:13.880> see<00:03:14.000> we've

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
finally ground up as you can see we've

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.900 
finally ground up as you can see we've
got<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.299> nice<00:03:14.420> consistency<00:03:14.930> here<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.700> next

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910

pretty<00:03:50.150> quickly<00:03:50.450> here<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.470> put<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.799> in<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.160> lot

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
pretty quickly here we put it in a lot

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.660 
pretty quickly here we put it in a lot
of<00:03:52.480> foods<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.230> never

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
of foods so it never

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.550 
of foods so it never
sticks<00:03:54.880> around<00:03:55.120> too<00:03:55.300> long<00:03:55.330> for<00:03:55.960> us<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.410> so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
sticks around too long for us and so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.870 
sticks around too long for us and so
we'll<00:03:56.800> actually<00:03:57.100> either<00:03:57.340> leave<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.610> out<00:03:57.790> of
