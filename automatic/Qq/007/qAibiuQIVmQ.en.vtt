00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.830 
with your starts for example you can
jump<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.149> board<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.040> ride<00:01:54.700> away<00:01:54.850> another

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
jump on the board and ride away another

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.330 
jump on the board and ride away another
way<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.259> take<00:01:56.470> your<00:01:56.590> back<00:01:56.770> foot<00:01:56.800> place<00:01:57.310> it

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
way is to take your back foot place it

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.749 
way is to take your back foot place it
on<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.729> tail<00:01:57.970> hop<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> deck<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.860> then

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
on the tail hop up the deck and then

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.160 
on the tail hop up the deck and then
like<00:02:01.000> you're<00:02:01.180> dropping<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.690> at<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.899> skatepark

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
like you're dropping in at the skatepark

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.469 
like you're dropping in at the skatepark
put<00:02:03.130> your<00:02:03.280> front<00:02:03.460> foot<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:03.880> with<00:02:04.060> some<00:02:04.179> forward

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
put your front foot on with some forward

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.300 
put your front foot on with some forward
momentum<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:06.210> roll<00:02:07.210> away<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.160> showed

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
momentum and roll away so I just showed

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.710 
momentum and roll away so I just showed
you<00:02:09.459> guys<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.610> few<00:02:10.000> ways<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.479> started

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
you guys a few ways to get started

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.479 
you guys a few ways to get started
there's<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.470> lot<00:02:11.650> more<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.040> we<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.250> create

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
there's a lot more that we can create

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.979 
there's a lot more that we can create
together<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:13.690> favorite<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.320> finger<00:02:14.739> flip<00:02:14.950> start

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.300 

so<00:02:19.989> there<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.200> two<00:02:20.440> ways<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.950> ride<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
so there are two ways you can ride the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.820 
so there are two ways you can ride the
axes<00:02:21.610> got<00:02:21.790> sport<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.989> by<00:02:23.380> moving<00:02:23.620> your

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
axes got sport one is by moving your

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.310 
axes got sport one is by moving your
feet<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.489> toe<00:02:24.760> toe<00:02:25.150> heel<00:02:25.510> heel<00:02:25.540> motion

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
feet in a toe toe heel heel motion

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.240 
feet in a toe toe heel heel motion
together<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.010> parallel

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.760 

the<00:02:36.250> second

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the second

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.460 
the second
is<00:02:37.860> by<00:02:38.370> using<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.120> body<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.750> alternating

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
is by using your body and alternating

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.970 
is by using your body and alternating
either<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> front<00:02:41.850> or<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:43.590> move<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
either the front or the back to move the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.250 
either the front or the back to move the
board<00:02:44.190> along<00:02:44.660> carving<00:02:45.660> kind<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.960> like<00:02:46.080> in

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
board along carving kind of like in

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.010 
board along carving kind of like in
surfing<00:02:46.740> or<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> lot<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.460> snowboarding<00:02:48.020> so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
surfing or a lot like in snowboarding so

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.510 
surfing or a lot like in snowboarding so
the<00:02:49.110> first<00:02:49.350> way<00:02:49.560> you're<00:02:49.770> really<00:02:49.950> using<00:02:50.190> more

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
the first way you're really using more

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.370 
the first way you're really using more
of<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.790> feet<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.720> second<00:02:52.080> way<00:02:52.170> you're

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
of your feet and the second way you're

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.860 
of your feet and the second way you're
really<00:02:52.650> using<00:02:52.800> more<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.340> body<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:54.840> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
really using more of your body so like a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.650 
really using more of your body so like a
surfer<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> snowboarder<00:02:56.760> might<00:02:56.970> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
surfer where a snowboarder might have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.510 
surfer where a snowboarder might have
that<00:02:57.900> same<00:02:58.170> motion<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.770> carving<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> water

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
that same motion of carving up the water

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.850 
that same motion of carving up the water
or<00:02:59.730> carving<00:03:00.030> up<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.240> snow<00:03:00.560> that's<00:03:01.560> what<00:03:01.740> we're

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
or carving up the snow that's what we're

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.190 
or carving up the snow that's what we're
focusing<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.340> here

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.539 

once<00:03:11.200> you're<00:03:11.349> comfortable<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.400> use<00:03:12.519> a

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
once you're comfortable you can use a

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.610 
once you're comfortable you can use a
combination<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:13.359> both<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.810> get<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.379> best

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
combination of both to get the best

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:25.590 
combination of both to get the best
forward<00:03:15.129> momentum

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.540 

this<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> great<00:03:26.500> time<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.950> mess<00:03:27.100> around<00:03:27.130> with

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
this is a great time to mess around with

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.550 
this is a great time to mess around with
your<00:03:27.670> foot<00:03:27.910> placement<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.930> see<00:03:32.170> what<00:03:32.350> feels

your foot placement and see what feels

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.070 
your foot placement and see what feels
most<00:03:32.800> comfortable<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.660> have

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
most comfortable for you now you have

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.800 
most comfortable for you now you have
started<00:03:35.350> your<00:03:35.740> ride<00:03:35.950> with<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> push<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.660> you'd

like to continue to arrive with a push

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:54.820 
like to continue to arrive with a push
you<00:03:40.680> can't<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:43.060> keep<00:03:43.180> pushing

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830
