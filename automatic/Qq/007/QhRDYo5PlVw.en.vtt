00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

so-called<00:00:46.739> proof<00:00:46.980> alone<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.210> said<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so-called proof alone as I said in the

series it takes Bob much less time to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
series it takes Bob much less time to
make<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> mess<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> does<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.180> me<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> come

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
make a mess than it does for me to come

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.810 
make a mess than it does for me to come
in<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.870> clean<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.309> second<00:00:56.670> reason

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in and clean it up the second reason

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
in and clean it up the second reason
these<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.300> being<00:00:57.510> chopped<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.989> into<00:00:58.140> smaller

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
these are being chopped up into smaller

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
these are being chopped up into smaller
bits<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> referenced

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
bits is so that they can be referenced
