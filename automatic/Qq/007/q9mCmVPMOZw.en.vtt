the<00:00:33.420> English<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:33.929> the<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.140> who<00:00:34.289> perfected<00:00:34.890> it

the English are the one who perfected it
they<00:00:35.609> came<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:37.010> curing<00:00:38.010> woods<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.879> over

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
they came up with curing woods for over

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.239 
they came up with curing woods for over
four<00:00:39.269> years<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.140> different<00:00:40.350> processes<00:00:40.649> that

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
four years and different processes that

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.950 
four years and different processes that
helped<00:00:41.550> harden<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> woods<00:00:42.449> and<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.809> them

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
helped harden the woods and make them

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.099 
helped harden the woods and make them
really<00:00:43.230> strong<00:00:43.789> some<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> english<00:00:45.870> long

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
really strong some of the english long

draw<00:00:48.659> weight<00:00:48.920> there's<00:00:49.920> many<00:00:50.100> accounts<00:00:50.550> where

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
draw weight there's many accounts where

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.209 
draw weight there's many accounts where
people<00:00:51.690> test<00:00:51.929> firing<00:00:52.350> arrows<00:00:52.589> at<00:00:52.739> close<00:00:52.920> range

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
people test firing arrows at close range

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.969 
people test firing arrows at close range
arrow<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.329> penetrated<00:00:54.659> four<00:00:55.379> inches<00:00:55.739> deep

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979

into<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> solid<00:00:56.729> wood<00:00:56.909> door<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:59.069> can

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
into a solid wood door so you can

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.500 
into a solid wood door so you can
imagine<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.639> had<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:00:59.969> of<00:00:59.999> power<00:01:00.179> back

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
imagine they had a lot of power back

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.189 
imagine they had a lot of power back
then<00:01:00.769> now<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.129> longbow<00:01:02.690> though<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.839> was<00:01:03.960> used

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
then now the longbow though it was used

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.520 
then now the longbow though it was used
for<00:01:04.409> hunting<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.369> wasn't<00:01:05.729> initially<00:01:05.939> designed

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
for hunting it wasn't initially designed

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
for hunting it wasn't initially designed
for<00:01:07.670> shooting<00:01:08.670> arrow<00:01:08.880> straight<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
for shooting arrow straight down the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
for shooting arrow straight down the
field<00:01:10.079> and<00:01:10.409> hitting<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> target<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.729> was

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
field and hitting a target it was

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.399 
field and hitting a target it was
originally<00:01:12.420> designed<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.079> that<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
originally designed so that way you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
originally designed so that way you
could<00:01:13.710> shoot<00:01:14.520> arrows<00:01:14.759> long<00:01:15.060> distance<00:01:15.570> by

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
could shoot arrows long distance by

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
could shoot arrows long distance by
shooting<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.200> high<00:01:16.409> into<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> air<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
shooting them high into the air and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.480 
shooting them high into the air and
creating<00:01:17.549> an<00:01:17.640> arc<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.380> what<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.829> developed

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
creating an arc and what that developed

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.660 
creating an arc and what that developed
was<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.880> actual<00:01:21.119> broadhead<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.579> acted<00:01:23.579> as

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
was the actual broadhead which acted as

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969 
was the actual broadhead which acted as
a<00:01:23.729> large<00:01:24.000> weight<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> longbow<00:01:25.799> would

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
a large weight so what the longbow would

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
a large weight so what the longbow would
do<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> fire<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.610> arrow<00:01:27.149> up<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> high<00:01:27.810> arc

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
do is fire the arrow up into a high arc

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.340 
do is fire the arrow up into a high arc
to<00:01:28.680> overreach<00:01:29.100> any<00:01:29.280> castle<00:01:29.729> walls<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.350> after

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to overreach any castle walls and after

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
to overreach any castle walls and after
it<00:01:31.439> had<00:01:31.530> gone<00:01:31.680> over<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.039> castle<00:01:32.399> wall<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it had gone over the castle wall the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
it had gone over the castle wall the
heavy<00:01:33.420> weight<00:01:33.719> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.109> arrowhead<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:35.310> then

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
heavy weight of the arrowhead would then

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
heavy weight of the arrowhead would then
make<00:01:35.640> sure<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.909> came<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.109> a<00:01:37.140> point<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
make sure it came down at a point and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
make sure it came down at a point and
the<00:01:38.369> momentum<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> arrowhead<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the momentum of the arrowhead and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
the momentum of the arrowhead and
gravity<00:01:40.109> would<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:40.770> allow<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> penetrate

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
gravity would then allow it to penetrate

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
gravity would then allow it to penetrate
through<00:01:42.299> steel<00:01:42.600> armor<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
through steel armor and all that and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370 
through steel armor and all that and
essentially<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> longbow<00:01:45.359> even<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> playing

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
essentially the longbow even the playing

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.700 
essentially the longbow even the playing
