00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
about ten years ago I kind of got tired

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.770 
about ten years ago I kind of got tired
of<00:00:51.220> my<00:00:51.310> local<00:00:51.490> trails<00:00:51.880> I<00:00:52.060> had<00:00:52.180> been<00:00:52.390> doing<00:00:52.540> them

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
of my local trails I had been doing them

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.570 
of my local trails I had been doing them
for<00:00:52.810> 15<00:00:53.410> years<00:00:53.620> my<00:00:53.830> local<00:00:54.190> mountain<00:00:54.430> bike

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
for 15 years my local mountain bike

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.330 
for 15 years my local mountain bike
trails<00:00:54.820> in<00:00:55.060> Bidwell<00:00:55.750> Park<00:00:55.990> and<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:57.070> thought

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
trails in Bidwell Park and I thought

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.190 
trails in Bidwell Park and I thought
let's<00:00:57.580> you<00:00:58.120> know<00:00:58.150> let's<00:00:58.330> try<00:00:58.900> something

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
let's you know let's try something

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.980 
let's you know let's try something
different<00:00:59.440> so<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.760> went<00:01:01.180> I'm<00:01:01.540> going<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.810> I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
different so I went I'm going to I

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.700 
different so I went I'm going to I
decided<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.040> try<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.190> drop<00:01:03.490> bar<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:05.290> kinds<00:01:05.650> of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
decided to try a drop bar all kinds of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.620 
decided to try a drop bar all kinds of
hand<00:01:05.890> positions<00:01:06.310> where<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.549> drop<00:01:06.759> bar<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.270> I

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
hand positions where the drop bar and I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.620 
hand positions where the drop bar and I
went<00:01:07.840> with<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> pretty<00:01:08.320> fat<00:01:08.770> tire<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:09.820> pan

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
went with a pretty fat tire this pan

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
went with a pretty fat tire this pan
eraser<00:01:11.080> 45<00:01:11.710> 700<00:01:12.670> by<00:01:12.759> 45<00:01:13.180> had<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:13.509> come<00:01:13.659> out<00:01:13.810> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
eraser 45 700 by 45 had just come out I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780 
eraser 45 700 by 45 had just come out I
thought<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.820> was<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:16.020> complete<00:01:17.020> game-changer

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.149 
thought it was a complete game-changer
so<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.390> sent<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.869> set<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.110> these<00:01:20.260> tires<00:01:20.620> with<00:01:20.980> some

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
so I sent a set of these tires with some

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.030 
so I sent a set of these tires with some

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
wanted to make a fun bike to try some

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.270 
wanted to make a fun bike to try some
something<00:01:50.740> different<00:01:51.520> in<00:01:51.670> my<00:01:51.760> local<00:01:51.970> trails

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
something different in my local trails

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so let's just take a look at the parts I

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.859 
so let's just take a look at the parts I
used<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.210> cross<00:01:58.450> lever<00:01:58.720> on

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
used to do that have a cross lever on

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.870 
used to do that have a cross lever on
the<00:01:58.960> left<00:01:59.049> which<00:01:59.560> separates<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.070> front<00:02:00.490> which

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the left which separates the front which

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.640 
the left which separates the front which
we<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.180> know<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.570> your<00:02:01.720> most<00:02:01.900> powerful<00:02:02.140> brake

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
we all know is your most powerful brake

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.340 
we all know is your most powerful brake
and<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.580> right<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.270> conserve<00:02:04.750> space<00:02:05.080> I've

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
and on the right to conserve space I've

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.940 
and on the right to conserve space I've
left<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.400> right<00:02:06.610> cross<00:02:06.820> lever<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.180> used<00:02:07.420> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
left out the right cross lever I used a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.320 
left out the right cross lever I used a
SRAM<00:02:08.950> 10<00:02:09.220> speed<00:02:09.489> shifter<00:02:09.909> on<00:02:10.030> one<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.179> our

want<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> draw<00:02:52.880> attention<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.960> is<00:02:54.140> a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
want to draw attention to this this is a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.310 
want to draw attention to this this is a
bottom<00:02:54.710> bracket<00:02:54.800> mount<00:02:55.220> chain<00:02:56.030> keeper<00:02:56.480> this

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
bottom bracket mount chain keeper this

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.220 
bottom bracket mount chain keeper this
was<00:02:57.530> way<00:02:57.980> before<00:02:58.040> SRAM<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.390> they<00:02:59.780> won<00:02:59.990> by

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
was way before SRAM and they won by

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.770 
was way before SRAM and they won by
which<00:03:00.830> they<00:03:01.100> now<00:03:01.370> own<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> narrow<00:03:02.510> wide

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
which they now own with the narrow wide

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.530 
which they now own with the narrow wide
which<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.290> great<00:03:03.500> idea<00:03:03.830> but<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:05.060> kind<00:03:05.450> of

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
which is a great idea but we kind of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.090 
which is a great idea but we kind of
think<00:03:05.660> we<00:03:05.900> were<00:03:06.080> one<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.380> pioneers<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
think we were one of the pioneers of the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.260 
think we were one of the pioneers of the
one<00:03:07.250> by<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.510> chain<00:03:08.750> keeper<00:03:10.270> so

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
one by with with the chain keeper so

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.230 
one by with with the chain keeper so
what<00:03:11.840> happens<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.470> was<00:03:12.770> took<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.550> out<00:03:13.820> and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
what happens it was took this out and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.680 
what happens it was took this out and
what<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.110> found<00:03:15.440> was<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:16.220> local<00:03:16.730> park<00:03:17.180> where<00:03:17.480> I
