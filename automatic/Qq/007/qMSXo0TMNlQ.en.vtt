I<00:02:03.590> don't<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.630> mediation<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:06.020> perhaps

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
I don't think that mediation is perhaps

the now and I would use but certainly we
will<00:02:09.890> be<00:02:10.700> interested<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.420> perspectives

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
will be interested in the perspectives

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.650 
will be interested in the perspectives
that<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.770> will<00:02:12.920> hear<00:02:13.190> from<00:02:13.220> our<00:02:13.660> important
