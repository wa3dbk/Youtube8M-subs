00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
did I think you can still go back and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
did I think you can still go back and
play<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.520> stasis<00:02:50.790> support

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
play it but you get the stasis support
