00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
means that everything on this layer is

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.899 
means that everything on this layer is
transparent<00:00:30.380> if<00:00:30.980> we<00:00:31.220> were<00:00:31.339> to<00:00:31.519> paint<00:00:31.729> with

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
Photoshop you get this shortcut menu of

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.170 
Photoshop you get this shortcut menu of
popular<00:04:15.959> options<00:04:16.530> essentially<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:17.910> in

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
popular options essentially and then in

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.729 
popular options essentially and then in
this<00:04:18.269> case<00:04:18.479> we'll<00:04:18.690> choose<00:04:18.720> delete<00:04:19.260> layer<00:04:19.440> mask

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
this case we'll choose delete layer mask

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.770 
this case we'll choose delete layer mask
so<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.010> goes<00:04:20.190> away<00:04:20.370> we're<00:04:21.209> gonna<00:04:21.329> add<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.570> new

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so it goes away we're gonna add a new

layer mask I've already created for you
in<00:04:23.550> advance<00:04:23.699> I've<00:04:24.060> created<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.630> inside<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
in advance I've created it inside the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.399 
in advance I've created it inside the
channels<00:04:25.830> panel<00:04:26.159> so<00:04:27.090> click<00:04:27.479> on<00:04:27.510> channels<00:04:28.229> to

elzar<00:04:30.269> fairly<00:04:30.629> complicated<00:04:31.079> the<00:04:31.439> idea<00:04:31.860> is

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
elzar fairly complicated the idea is

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.639 
elzar fairly complicated the idea is
that<00:04:32.429> you<00:04:32.789> have<00:04:32.969> a<00:04:32.999> channel<00:04:33.479> of<00:04:33.539> red<00:04:33.779> green<00:04:34.229> and

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:34.649 
that you have a channel of red green and

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.559 
that you have a channel of red green and
blue<00:04:35.009> luminance<00:04:35.549> information<00:04:35.759> they're<00:04:36.449> all

however<00:05:06.239> they're<00:05:06.869> not<00:05:06.899> hard<00:05:07.469> to<00:05:07.799> use<00:05:08.069> if<00:05:08.459> you

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:08.549 
however they're not hard to use if you

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:10.699 
however they're not hard to use if you
just<00:05:08.759> stumble<00:05:09.089> across<00:05:09.179> a<00:05:09.389> bunch<00:05:09.719> as<00:05:09.989> in<00:05:10.619> the

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
name of this particular image and then I

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.059 
name of this particular image and then I
would<00:05:53.189> switch<00:05:53.489> my<00:05:53.729> channel<00:05:54.329> from<00:05:55.319> brow<00:05:55.769> and

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
would switch my channel from brow and

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.189 
would switch my channel from brow and
nose<00:05:56.249> transparency<00:05:57.059> to<00:05:57.209> just<00:05:57.419> brow<00:05:57.659> and<00:05:58.019> nose

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
nose transparency to just brow and nose

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.829 
nose transparency to just brow and nose
so<00:05:58.589> brow<00:05:59.009> and<00:05:59.249> nose<00:05:59.459> transparency<00:06:00.329> indicates

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839 
so brow and nose transparency indicates

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.069 
so brow and nose transparency indicates
the<00:06:01.489> transparency<00:06:02.489> that's<00:06:03.179> at<00:06:03.509> work<00:06:03.749> for<00:06:04.019> the

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:04.079 
the transparency that's at work for the

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:06.109 
the transparency that's at work for the
brow<00:06:04.349> and<00:06:04.589> nose<00:06:04.799> layer<00:06:05.099> that<00:06:05.489> entire<00:06:05.819> layers

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:06.119 
brow and nose layer that entire layers

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.609 
brow and nose layer that entire layers
opaque<00:06:06.599> so<00:06:06.839> that<00:06:06.989> wouldn't<00:06:07.169> do<00:06:07.259> us<00:06:07.379> any<00:06:07.499> good

00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:07.619 
opaque so that wouldn't do us any good

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.369 
opaque so that wouldn't do us any good
then<00:06:08.399> we<00:06:08.519> drop<00:06:08.789> down<00:06:08.819> to<00:06:09.209> the<00:06:09.329> actual<00:06:09.659> alpha

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
then we drop down to the actual alpha

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.899 
then we drop down to the actual alpha
channels<00:06:10.769> one<00:06:11.309> of<00:06:11.459> which<00:06:11.639> coincidentally

of the Alpha Channel and transported
them<00:06:59.970> into<00:07:00.539> this<00:07:00.659> layer<00:07:00.930> mask<00:07:01.259> right<00:07:01.530> there

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770

this<00:07:16.560> layer<00:07:16.740> mask<00:07:17.039> thumbnail<00:07:17.280> I<00:07:17.759> go<00:07:18.240> ahead<00:07:18.330> and

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
this layer mask thumbnail I go ahead and

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.510 
this layer mask thumbnail I go ahead and
turn<00:07:18.719> it<00:07:18.750> off<00:07:18.990> for<00:07:19.590> the<00:07:19.710> moment<00:07:20.069> so<00:07:20.190> this<00:07:20.310> is

what the image looked like without that
mask<00:07:22.560> you<00:07:23.159> can<00:07:23.310> see<00:07:23.370> an<00:07:23.639> X<00:07:23.849> through<00:07:24.060> it<00:07:24.180> right

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
mask you can see an X through it right

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.409 
mask you can see an X through it right
here<00:07:24.599> if<00:07:25.259> I<00:07:25.379> shift<00:07:25.440> click<00:07:25.860> again<00:07:26.159> this<00:07:26.819> is<00:07:27.090> what

here if I shift click again this is what

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:29.659 
here if I shift click again this is what
the<00:07:27.659> effect<00:07:28.050> looks<00:07:28.319> like<00:07:28.560> with<00:07:28.919> the<00:07:29.129> mask<00:07:29.370> so

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
the effect looks like with the mask so

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.279 
the effect looks like with the mask so
that<00:07:29.699> we're<00:07:30.030> cutting<00:07:30.389> through<00:07:30.569> the<00:07:30.810> brow<00:07:31.020> and

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:31.289 
that we're cutting through the brow and

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.140 
that we're cutting through the brow and
nose<00:07:31.440> layer<00:07:31.740> to<00:07:32.009> see<00:07:32.190> the<00:07:32.340> liquefying<00:07:32.879> eyes

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
nose layer to see the liquefying eyes

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.749 
nose layer to see the liquefying eyes
layer<00:07:33.569> below<00:07:33.870> and<00:07:34.349> we're<00:07:34.919> getting<00:07:35.250> the<00:07:35.400> best

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 
layer below and we're getting the best

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.149 
layer below and we're getting the best
of<00:07:36.030> what<00:07:36.479> these<00:07:36.750> two<00:07:37.110> layers<00:07:37.349> have<00:07:37.770> to<00:07:37.949> offer

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159 
of what these two layers have to offer

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.339 
of what these two layers have to offer
in<00:07:39.090> the<00:07:39.270> next<00:07:39.509> exercise<00:07:39.990> we're<00:07:40.199> going<00:07:40.289> to

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:40.349 
in the next exercise we're going to

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.619 
in the next exercise we're going to
select<00:07:40.560> this<00:07:40.889> girl's<00:07:41.159> skin<00:07:41.490> so<00:07:42.120> that<00:07:42.330> we<00:07:42.479> can

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:42.629 
select this girl's skin so that we can

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.440 
select this girl's skin so that we can
