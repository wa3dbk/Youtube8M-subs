00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
leave it for a couple of months until I

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.689 
leave it for a couple of months until I
was<00:00:51.889> given<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.280> sniff<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.389> day<00:00:54.519> which<00:00:55.519> was

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
was given a sniff of a day which was

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.729 
was given a sniff of a day which was
naturally<00:00:56.149> lower<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.959> time<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:57.350> made<00:00:57.589> me

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
naturally lower the time it made me

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.889 
naturally lower the time it made me
quite<00:00:57.949> nervous<00:00:58.219> Niki<00:00:58.699> now<00:00:58.879> as<00:00:59.149> I<00:00:59.359> was<00:00:59.569> leaving

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
quite nervous Niki now as I was leaving

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.579 
quite nervous Niki now as I was leaving
it<00:00:59.989> alone

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
it alone

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.489 
it alone
and<00:01:00.769> I<00:01:01.100> would<00:01:01.219> forget<00:01:01.489> about<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.409> think<00:01:03.409> it

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
and I would forget about it I think it

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.140 
and I would forget about it I think it
actually<00:01:03.589> gave<00:01:03.920> me<00:01:04.070> quite<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.549> few<00:01:04.670> favors

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
actually gave me quite a few favors

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.750 
actually gave me quite a few favors
because<00:01:05.330> when<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:05.600> did<00:01:05.690> come<00:01:06.080> back<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.760> to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
because when I did come back to it to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.360 
because when I did come back to it to
prepare<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.540> I've<00:01:08.659> got<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.960> date<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:09.500> think<00:01:10.310> it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
prepare and I've got the date I think it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.370 
prepare and I've got the date I think it
was<00:01:10.460> about<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.670> month<00:01:10.820> before<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.780> picked<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:12.290> up

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
was about a month before I picked it up

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.850 
was about a month before I picked it up
again<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.880> was<00:01:14.150> able<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.420> look<00:01:14.720> at<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.990> through

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
again I was able to look at it through

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.960 
again I was able to look at it through
fresh<00:01:16.460> hollings

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
fresh hollings

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090 
fresh hollings
not<00:01:17.780> completely<00:01:18.290> impartial<00:01:18.710> all<00:01:18.950> these

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
not completely impartial all these

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.800 
not completely impartial all these
things<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.520> was<00:01:19.670> aware<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:20.090> had<00:01:20.330> written<00:01:20.600> it

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
things I was aware that I had written it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.580 
things I was aware that I had written it
and<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.830> was<00:01:22.010> felt<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.640> was<00:01:22.790> reading<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.500> from<00:01:24.500> a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and I was felt I was reading it from a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.860 
and I was felt I was reading it from a
distance<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:25.970> couldn't<00:01:26.240> be<00:01:26.390> more<00:01:26.600> critical

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
distance so I couldn't be more critical

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.330 
distance so I couldn't be more critical
of<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.910> how<00:01:29.120> I've<00:01:29.300> done<00:01:29.510> things

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
of of how I've done things

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
of of how I've done things
to<00:01:31.030> think<00:01:31.270> behind<00:01:31.420> what<00:01:32.290> are<00:01:32.380> they<00:01:32.500> likely<00:01:32.710> to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
to think behind what are they likely to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.819 
to think behind what are they likely to
pick<00:01:33.100> up<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.460> what<00:01:33.869> am<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:34.990> looking<00:01:35.200> at<00:01:35.500> my<00:01:35.710> look

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
pick up on what am I looking at my look

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.999 
pick up on what am I looking at my look
at<00:01:35.979> this<00:01:36.130> what<00:01:36.310> questions<00:01:36.759> do<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.030> ask<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.979> that

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
at this what questions do I ask so that

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.580 
at this what questions do I ask so that
really<00:01:39.340> helped<00:01:39.700> me<00:01:39.909> actually<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.600> although

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
really helped me actually so although

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.719 
really helped me actually so although
that<00:01:41.740> won't<00:01:41.829> be<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.070> case<00:01:42.100> for<00:01:42.250> everybody

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
that won't be the case for everybody

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.580 
that won't be the case for everybody
because<00:01:42.880> some<00:01:43.450> people<00:01:43.750> have<00:01:43.780> farmers<00:01:44.350> within

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
because some people have farmers within

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.760 
because some people have farmers within
a<00:01:44.680> month<00:01:44.860> or<00:01:45.009> two<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.659> actually<00:01:46.659> found<00:01:47.020> putting

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
a month or two I actually found putting

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.469 
a month or two I actually found putting
it<00:01:47.860> down<00:01:48.039> even<00:01:48.399> beyond<00:01:48.880> even<00:01:49.179> if<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.390> just

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
it down even beyond even if it's just

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.690 
it down even beyond even if it's just
for<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.810> week<00:01:49.960> or<00:01:50.259> two<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:51.130> actually<00:01:51.340> really

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
for a week or two is actually really

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.980 
for a week or two is actually really
helpful<00:01:52.179> because<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.450> gives<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.750> bit<00:01:52.929> of

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
helpful because it gives you a bit of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.550 
helpful because it gives you a bit of
distance<00:01:53.820> otherwise<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.450> close<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.439> we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
distance otherwise you so close to it we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.980 
distance otherwise you so close to it we
just<00:01:56.770> can't<00:01:57.039> see<00:01:57.220> look<00:01:57.369> at<00:01:57.429> home<00:01:57.640> trees<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.960> I

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
just can't see look at home trees what I

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.850 
just can't see look at home trees what I
did<00:01:59.259> actually<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.130> I've<00:02:00.490> got<00:02:00.700> some<00:02:00.939> colored

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.620

system<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.720> themes<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:09.130> my<00:02:09.280> thesis<00:02:09.489> but<00:02:09.789> I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
system of themes in my thesis but I

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.600 
system of themes in my thesis but I

thought they might pick up one and then

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.740 
thought they might pick up one and then

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.250 
concern for me because because my thesis
was<00:03:08.610> sort<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.910> embedded<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.360> medieval<00:03:09.900> English

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

was sort of embedded in medieval English
it<00:03:10.590> was<00:03:10.710> quite<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.580> few<00:03:12.330> yeah<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> few<00:03:13.260> far

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it was quite a few yeah a few far

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.530 
it was quite a few yeah a few far
between<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.250> Articles<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.820> came<00:03:15.330> out

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
I had sort of kept tabs on on the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.700 
I had sort of kept tabs on on the
journals<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.490> I'd<00:03:20.820> read<00:03:21.350> throughout<00:03:22.350> my

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
journals that I'd read throughout my

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.940 
journals that I'd read throughout my
thesis<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:23.990> they<00:03:24.990> would<00:03:25.260> publish<00:03:25.740> yourself

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
thesis but they would publish yourself

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.360 
thesis but they would publish yourself
quite<00:03:26.730> frequently<00:03:27.360> anyway<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.980> didn't

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
quite frequently anyway so I didn't

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.520 
quite frequently anyway so I didn't
really<00:03:29.610> have<00:03:29.880> too<00:03:30.360> many<00:03:30.420> pubs<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.900> nap<00:03:31.110> I'd<00:03:31.350> also

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
really have too many pubs a nap I'd also

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.930 
really have too many pubs a nap I'd also
my<00:03:32.490> colleagues<00:03:34.220> office<00:03:35.220> neither<00:03:35.580> mind<00:03:35.760> my

my colleagues office neither mind my

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.240 
my colleagues office neither mind my
father<00:03:36.120> coming<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.260> think<00:03:37.890> because

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
father coming out so I think because

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.710 
father coming out so I think because
they<00:03:38.370> miss<00:03:38.550> them<00:03:38.700> doing<00:03:38.880> their<00:03:39.060> work<00:03:39.360> they

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
they miss them doing their work they

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.500 
they miss them doing their work they
keep<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.620> informed<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:41.190> anything<00:03:41.510> new

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
keep you informed of anything new
