something<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.649> spread<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
something like this spread I think that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.180 
something like this spread I think that
would<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.940> nicer<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> seeds<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> have

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
would be nicer for the seeds to have

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.930 
would be nicer for the seeds to have

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
many new interesting shapes that we will

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
many new interesting shapes that we will

see in future volvo interiors it also

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.059 
see in future volvo interiors it also
explores<00:01:28.390> what<00:01:29.170> we<00:01:29.350> can<00:01:29.469> do<00:01:29.560> with<00:01:29.709> different

materials<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> copper<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.979> way<00:01:33.369> that

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
materials like the copper the way that

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.249 
materials like the copper the way that
we<00:01:33.700> use<00:01:33.880> wood<00:01:34.179> in<00:01:34.329> this<00:01:34.450> car<00:01:34.719> and<00:01:34.929> they<00:01:35.049> also

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
we use wood in this car and they also

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.289 
we use wood in this car and they also
the<00:01:35.469> way<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.859> use<00:01:36.009> leather<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.640> seats

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
the way that we use leather on the seats

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:48.210 
the way that we use leather on the seats
in<00:01:37.719> his<00:01:37.899> car

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.060 

I<00:01:48.310> loved<00:01:49.120> this<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.140> process<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.770> doing<00:01:50.890> this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
I loved this the process of doing this

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.940 
I loved this the process of doing this
concept<00:01:51.640> car<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:51.970> mean<00:01:52.180> it's<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.720> versus<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.410> four

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
concept car I mean it's a versus of four

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.910 
concept car I mean it's a versus of four
door<00:01:54.160> sedan<00:01:54.460> which<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.420> very<00:01:55.630> sexy<00:01:56.440> sporty

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
door sedan which is a very sexy sporty

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.910 
door sedan which is a very sexy sporty
car<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.140> proportions<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.800> can

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
car and with that proportions you can

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.670 
car and with that proportions you can
really<00:02:00.100> sort<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:02.020> fun<00:02:02.230> with<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.650> know

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
really sort of have fun with it you know

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.180 
really sort of have fun with it you know
and<00:02:03.510> really<00:02:04.510> try<00:02:04.840> some<00:02:05.080> emphasize<00:02:06.040> their

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
and really try some emphasize their

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.060 
and really try some emphasize their
lamps<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.670> give<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.510> much<00:02:07.750> more<00:02:08.020> focused<00:02:08.890> look

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
lamps and give a much more focused look

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.680 
lamps and give a much more focused look
at<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.220> front<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.670> also<00:02:09.910> aggressively<00:02:10.360> and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
at the front and also aggressively and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:22.610 
at the front and also aggressively and
really<00:02:11.320> get<00:02:11.470> some<00:02:12.040> new<00:02:12.310> ideas<00:02:12.430> across<00:02:12.880> her

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.619 

in<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.800> particular<00:02:24.010> car<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.849> think<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
in this particular car I think that the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.570 
in this particular car I think that the
crystal<00:02:26.049> center<00:02:26.379> stack<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.739> an<00:02:26.860> example<00:02:27.159> an

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
crystal center stack is an example an

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.000 
crystal center stack is an example an
exponent<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.870> premium<00:02:29.319> could<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
exponent of what premium could be in the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
exponent of what premium could be in the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.699 
design is to really lift out and work
with<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.489> material<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.629> form<00:02:37.900> at<00:02:38.650> the

with the material and the form at the
same<00:02:38.980> time<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.459> make<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.180> as<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.569> as

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
same time and make it as just as

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.789 
same time and make it as just as
important<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.290> something

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
important and that is really something

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.030 
important and that is really something
that<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.069> have<00:02:45.250> tried<00:02:45.519> for<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.239> car<00:02:47.040> lifting

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that we have tried for this car lifting

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.740 
that we have tried for this car lifting
out<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:48.879> example<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.299> center<00:02:49.569> stack

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
out so for example the center stack

out so for example the center stack
where<00:02:50.019> we<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.379> crystal<00:02:50.620> glass<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.519> the

where we have the crystal glass it's the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240 
where we have the crystal glass it's the
material<00:02:52.720> speaking<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.680> much<00:02:53.860> as<00:02:54.099> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
material speaking just as much as the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:09.410 
material speaking just as much as the
form

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.270 

we<00:03:09.959> want<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.230> provoke<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.590> little<00:03:10.920> bit<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.130> one

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
we want to provoke a little bit on one

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430 
we want to provoke a little bit on one
side<00:03:11.520> but<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.180> also<00:03:12.330> took<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.690> color<00:03:13.020> which<00:03:13.290> we

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
side but we also took a color which we

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.460 
side but we also took a color which we
found<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.950> be<00:03:14.130> very<00:03:14.239> Scandinavian<00:03:15.319> if<00:03:16.319> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
found to be very Scandinavian if you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.199 
found to be very Scandinavian if you
look<00:03:16.590> at<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> rock<00:03:16.980> formations<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.910> look<00:03:18.090> at

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
look at the rock formations you look at

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.510 
look at the rock formations you look at
the<00:03:18.300> summer<00:03:18.540> light<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.020> this<00:03:19.770> very<00:03:20.190> sort<00:03:20.430> of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
the summer light and this very sort of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.839 
the summer light and this very sort of
coppery<00:03:21.080> glow<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.500> see<00:03:22.739> there<00:03:22.980> from<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
coppery glow that you see there from the

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.610 
coppery glow that you see there from the
sunlight<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.510> wanted<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.900> bring<00:03:25.110> into<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
sunlight we wanted to bring into the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:39.520

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you can see the the connection to the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
you can see the the connection to the
past<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.440> do<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.709> abandon<00:03:44.160> approach<00:03:44.520> the
