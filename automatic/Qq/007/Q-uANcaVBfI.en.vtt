actually<00:00:44.399> bolts<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> frame<00:00:45.360> okay<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
actually bolts to the frame okay this is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
actually bolts to the frame okay this is
a<00:00:46.110> direct<00:00:46.559> mount<00:00:46.800> mech<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.520> has<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> 5<00:00:48.000> mil

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a direct mount mech so it has a 5 mil

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.810 
a direct mount mech so it has a 5 mil
bolt<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.719> secure<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.410> frame<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
bolt to secure it to the frame and you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
bolt to secure it to the frame and you
still<00:00:51.270> need<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> adjust<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
still need to adjust up and down the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
still need to adjust up and down the
same<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> band<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.090> band<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
same as a band on the band one the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.560 
same as a band on the band one the
adjustment<00:00:55.559> bolt<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.239> keeping<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> neck<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
adjustment bolt for keeping the neck on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
adjustment bolt for keeping the neck on
the<00:00:57.660> frame<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the frame will be on this side of the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
the frame will be on this side of the
seat<00:00:59.340> tube<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> far<00:01:00.239> side<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> that's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
seat tube so the far side and that's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
seat tube so the far side and that's
also<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> 5<00:01:02.070> millimeter<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.660> undo

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
also a 5 millimeter so if you just undo

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490 
also a 5 millimeter so if you just undo
it<00:01:04.199> slightly<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.229> move<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it slightly and then you can move the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.030 
it slightly and then you can move the
mech<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.390> need<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
mech up and down as you need to and your

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.000 
mech up and down as you need to and your
idea<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> mech<00:01:13.320> needs<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
idea is that the mech needs to be

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910 
idea is that the mech needs to be
between<00:01:14.189> 2<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> 3<00:01:15.180> millimeters<00:01:15.780> above<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
between 2 and 3 millimeters above the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
between 2 and 3 millimeters above the
outer<00:01:17.070> chain<00:01:17.460> ring<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.409> far

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
outer chain ring when it's this far

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
outer chain ring when it's this far
extreme<00:01:20.070> no<00:01:20.549> more<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> otherwise<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
extreme no more than that otherwise you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
extreme no more than that otherwise you
won't<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> Gears<00:01:22.200> probably<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.189> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
won't get a Gears probably so use that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
won't get a Gears probably so use that
height<00:01:23.549> adjustment<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> set<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
height adjustment to get it set here and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.899 
height adjustment to get it set here and
when<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.950> praying<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.460> tight<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
when that's right praying that tight and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
when that's right praying that tight and
we're<00:01:27.060> good<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> rear<00:01:28.619> mech

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
we're good now like with the rear mech

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
we're good now like with the rear mech
you're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> adjust<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you're going to adjust this with the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
you're going to adjust this with the
cable<00:01:30.780> free<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.110> tension<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> cable<00:01:32.100> not

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cable free of tension so the cable not

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
cable free of tension so the cable not
clamped<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> mech<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> free<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> move

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
clamped in so the mech is free to move

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
clamped in so the mech is free to move
under<00:01:34.799> its<00:01:34.920> own<00:01:35.040> steam<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> we'll<00:01:36.390> start<00:01:36.659> with

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
under its own steam and we'll start with

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
under its own steam and we'll start with
the<00:01:36.869> adjustment<00:01:37.320> screws<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.829> set<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> low<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the adjustment screws to set the low and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730

brings<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.660> chain<00:03:44.930> outer<00:03:45.230> guide<00:03:45.530> is

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
brings it out the chain outer guide is

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.620 
brings it out the chain outer guide is
rubbing<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.880> want<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.090> do<00:03:47.180> counter

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
rubbing so you want to do counter

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.110 
rubbing so you want to do counter
clockwise<00:03:47.810> until<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.890> no<00:03:49.040> longer<00:03:49.070> rubs<00:03:52.120> so

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
clockwise until it no longer rubs so

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.250 
clockwise until it no longer rubs so
this<00:03:53.300> is<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.450> bit<00:03:53.630> what<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.780> need<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.989> fine-tune

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
this is a bit what you need to fine-tune

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.560 
this is a bit what you need to fine-tune
everything<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.280> try<00:03:55.489> extremities<00:03:56.330> in<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
everything and try extremities in the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.479 
everything and try extremities in the
back<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.200> I'm<00:03:57.680> going<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.920> shift<00:03:58.100> into<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
back so I'm going to shift into the

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.070 
back so I'm going to shift into the
smaller<00:03:58.760> sprocket<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.660> give<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.959> most

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
smaller sprocket to give it the most

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080 
smaller sprocket to give it the most
direct<00:04:00.380> chain<00:04:00.980> line<00:04:01.160> with<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.430> out<00:04:01.550> sprocket

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
direct chain line with it out sprocket

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.550 
direct chain line with it out sprocket
and<00:04:02.570> fine<00:04:02.870> tune<00:04:03.140> if<00:04:03.320> necessary<00:04:05.320> as<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.470> can

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
and fine tune if necessary as you can

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.710 
and fine tune if necessary as you can
hear<00:04:06.620> does<00:04:07.100> actually<00:04:07.280> need<00:04:07.610> adjustment<00:04:10.720> I'm

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
hear does actually need adjustment I'm

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.320 
hear does actually need adjustment I'm
behind

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.699 

final<00:04:16.330> position<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.140> shift<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.560> to

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
final position to do is shift down to

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.949 
final position to do is shift down to
the<00:04:17.769> middle<00:04:18.070> chain<00:04:18.220> ring<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:19.480> which<00:04:19.690> there<00:04:19.900> is

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
the middle chain ring of which there is

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.870 
the middle chain ring of which there is
no<00:04:20.049> adjustment<00:04:20.410> screw<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.830> do<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.190> we<00:04:21.519> adjust

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
no adjustment screw to do this we adjust

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.580 
no adjustment screw to do this we adjust
the<00:04:21.940> neck<00:04:22.180> position<00:04:22.390> using<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.170> cable

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
the neck position using the cable

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.680 
the neck position using the cable
tension<00:04:24.010> with<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.340> barrel<00:04:24.580> adjuster<00:04:24.670> as<00:04:25.510> you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
tension with the barrel adjuster as you

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.890 
tension with the barrel adjuster as you
can<00:04:25.810> hear<00:04:26.020> there<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:26.770> some<00:04:27.010> slight<00:04:27.160> movement

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
can hear there is some slight movement

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.470 
can hear there is some slight movement
and<00:04:28.900> those<00:04:29.050> because<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.240> parallelogram<00:04:31.240> of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
and those because the parallelogram of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.330 
and those because the parallelogram of
the<00:04:31.570> MEC<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.990> rubbing<00:04:32.620> on<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> inside<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.280> the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
the MEC is rubbing on the inside of the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.820 
the MEC is rubbing on the inside of the
chain<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.780> need<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.960> take<00:04:35.170> some<00:04:35.410> tension

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
chain so if I need to take some tension

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.860 
chain so if I need to take some tension
away<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.850> I'll<00:04:36.970> screw<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.600> barrel

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
away so I'll screw it in the barrel

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.180 
away so I'll screw it in the barrel
adjuster<00:04:37.960> until<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:39.160> goes<00:04:39.340> away<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:42.100> that's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
adjuster until this goes away and that's

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.340 
adjuster until this goes away and that's
pretty<00:04:42.490> clear<00:04:42.850> there<00:04:43.090> let's<00:04:43.930> just<00:04:44.080> try<00:04:44.290> it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
pretty clear there let's just try it

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.410 
pretty clear there let's just try it
with<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.500> reader<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.490> Lea<00:04:45.700> at<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:45.970> bottom<00:04:46.240> end<00:04:46.390> of

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
with a reader a Lea at the bottom end of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.820 
with a reader a Lea at the bottom end of
the<00:04:46.480> spectrum<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:46.990> ensure<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.380> doesn't<00:04:47.530> rub<00:04:47.740> on

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
the spectrum to ensure it doesn't rub on

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.120 
the spectrum to ensure it doesn't rub on
the<00:04:47.920> other<00:04:48.040> side<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:51.760> we're<00:04:51.910> clear
