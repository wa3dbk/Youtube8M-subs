for<00:01:20.580> example<00:01:21.320> right<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> stuck

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
for example right now it is stuck

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.170 
for example right now it is stuck
between<00:01:25.010> two<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.220> half<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> three<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.150> a

between two and a half and three and a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.490 
between two and a half and three and a
half<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> middle<00:01:28.650> number<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> three

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
half the middle number is a three

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.040 
half the middle number is a three
release<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.649> tension<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.399> and

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
release the tension a little bit and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.810 
release the tension a little bit and
then<00:01:34.050> keep<00:01:34.290> turning<00:01:34.680> putting<00:01:35.040> tension<00:01:35.280> until

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
then keep turning putting tension until

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
then keep turning putting tension until
it<00:01:36.630> gets<00:01:36.780> locked<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> another<00:01:37.380> position<00:01:37.890> over

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it gets locked in another position over

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
it gets locked in another position over
here<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.270> locked<00:01:39.509> between<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> number<00:01:40.350> six

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
here it's locked between the number six

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.730 
here it's locked between the number six
and<00:01:41.009> seven<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:42.720> write<00:01:42.899> down<00:01:42.930> six

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and seven so I would write down six

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910 
and seven so I would write down six
point<00:01:44.039> five<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.820> middle<00:01:45.090> number<00:01:45.920> keep

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
point five as the middle number keep

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.999 
point five as the middle number keep
doing<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.399> until<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.440> all<00:01:49.740> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
number in the combination so now you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.940 
number in the combination so now you

twenty is the third digit what you do

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.150 
twenty is the third digit what you do
now<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.650> divide<00:03:19.650> 20<00:03:20.600> into<00:03:21.600> four<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:22.160> whatever

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
now is divide 20 into four or whatever

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.320 
now is divide 20 into four or whatever
number<00:03:23.340> your<00:03:23.670> last<00:03:23.910> digit<00:03:24.540> ends<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:26.330> in

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.499 
1 5 9 13 17 and so on if it was a tool
let's<00:04:40.710> start<00:04:40.979> at<00:04:41.099> 2<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.610> just<00:04:41.789> keep<00:04:41.969> adding<00:04:42.180> 4

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
let's start at 2 and just keep adding 4

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.839 
let's start at 2 and just keep adding 4
you<00:04:43.379> will<00:04:43.469> end<00:04:43.650> up<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.860> 10<00:04:44.280> different

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
you will end up with 10 different

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.050 
you will end up with 10 different
numbers<00:04:47.870> if<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.469> remainder<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.759> you<00:04:50.879> had

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
numbers if the remainder that you had

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.510 
numbers if the remainder that you had
earlier<00:04:51.389> was<00:04:52.349> a<00:04:52.409> 0<00:04:52.919> or<00:04:53.360> 1<00:04:54.360> add<00:04:55.370> 2<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.490> that

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
earlier was a 0 or 1 add 2 to that

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.820 
earlier was a 0 or 1 add 2 to that
number<00:04:56.909> so<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.930> 0<00:04:58.379> will<00:04:59.310> equal<00:04:59.550> 2<00:04:59.729> and<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.990> 1<00:05:01.199> will

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
number so a 0 will equal 2 and a 1 will

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.369 
number so a 0 will equal 2 and a 1 will
equal<00:05:01.889> 3<00:05:02.509> if<00:05:03.509> the<00:05:03.690> remainder<00:05:03.960> was<00:05:04.199> a<00:05:04.229> 3<00:05:04.530> or<00:05:04.680> 4

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
equal 3 if the remainder was a 3 or 4

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.459 
equal 3 if the remainder was a 3 or 4
subtract<00:05:07.379> 2<00:05:07.530> from<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.830> number<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.389> 3<00:05:09.810> would

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
subtract 2 from that number so a 3 would

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:19.790 
subtract 2 from that number so a 3 would
equal<00:05:10.500> 1<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:12.240> 4<00:05:12.680> would<00:05:13.680> equal<00:05:13.949> 2<00:05:16.610> now<00:05:18.800> start

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
equal 1 and a 4 would equal 2 now start

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
equal 1 and a 4 would equal 2 now start
at<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.280> number<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.240> right<00:05:21.629> now<00:05:21.659> in

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
at the number that you have right now in

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.129 
at the number that you have right now in
my<00:05:22.379> situation<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:23.069> had<00:05:23.279> a<00:05:23.310> remainder<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:23.940> 0<00:05:24.389> so<00:05:25.110> I

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
my situation I had a remainder of 0 so I

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.390 
my situation I had a remainder of 0 so I
will<00:05:25.259> start<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.740> 2<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:27.080> add<00:05:28.080> 4<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:29.009> each<00:05:29.039> one

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
will start with 2 and add 4 to each one

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:40.149 
will start with 2 and add 4 to each one
of<00:05:29.490> those<00:05:29.580> numbers<00:05:29.819> so<00:05:30.810> it's<00:05:30.960> 2<00:05:31.610> 6<00:05:32.930> 10<00:05:34.370> 14<00:05:36.560> 18<00:05:38.180> 22

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
of those numbers so it's 2 6 10 14 18 22

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:49.909 
of those numbers so it's 2 6 10 14 18 22

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919

and then I know the last digit is 20 and
it<00:06:30.719> didn't<00:06:30.930> go<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.259> then<00:06:32.129> I<00:06:32.219> tried<00:06:32.279> 0<00:06:32.759> 6<00:06:33.210> 20

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
and it won't go doing this 100 times

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.730 
and it won't go doing this 100 times
should<00:06:43.639> only<00:06:43.790> take<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.060> few<00:06:44.360> minutes<00:06:44.479> in<00:06:44.840> my

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
should only take a few minutes in my

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.230 
should only take a few minutes in my
situation<00:06:45.979> I<00:06:46.520> ended<00:06:47.180> up<00:06:47.270> with<00:06:48.370> 16<00:06:49.870> 26<00:06:50.870> and<00:06:51.110> 20

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
situation I ended up with 16 26 and 20

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.280 
situation I ended up with 16 26 and 20
and<00:06:53.240> that<00:06:53.360> is<00:06:53.510> how<00:06:53.630> you<00:06:53.690> figure<00:06:54.020> out<00:06:54.050> the

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
and that is how you figure out the

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.350 
and that is how you figure out the
combination<00:06:54.500> of<00:06:55.250> your<00:06:55.430> combination<00:06:55.970> left<00:06:56.090> if

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
combination of your combination left if

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.650 
combination of your combination left if
you<00:06:56.600> forgot<00:06:56.900> what<00:06:57.169> the<00:06:57.290> code<00:06:57.470> was
