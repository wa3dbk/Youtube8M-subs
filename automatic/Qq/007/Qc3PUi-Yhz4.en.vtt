00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hi, how are you greeting them doc xÃ tiva and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.589
 I bring a news today the great 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 question that everyone is made and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.800
 I also do it myself it's not about why 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 they did not show the current playstation 4 in 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.830
 the sony event because they did not show it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.599
 they all showed and we saw what would be the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 dualshock 4 the new control of the 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.770
 playstation 4 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 Well , this shuhei yoshida 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.970
 explained no and who cares about the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 moment to see the new console at the most 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.700
 important was to show specifications 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.220
 what came with the console for now 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 let's show the new playstation the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.440
 playstation 4 because it's called 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 Playstation 4 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 we are not going to show the playstation 4 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.379
 but we decided to show what would be the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 control because to show demos and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.390
 others obviously we had to use the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.600
 control but do not worry that in a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 future we will show what would be the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.520
 playstation 4 console these were 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.850
 words of his genius aids 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.700
 the more they are and everything they are 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.320
 inter tm are not studies but he said what 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.450
 next we have shown a lot in the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 playstation event this is good the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 February 20, so I do not know 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.810
 worry we do not want to bore you with 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.830
 so many novelties will see much more inside 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 of little 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.680
 so gentlemen on the one hand it's fine I 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.930
 I think we should not ask for more because the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 event is and the truth must be 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.530
 sincere people including zbot you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 liked it very much and I think that if 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 they showed everything in the event like that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 they were going to remove the magic to what was coming 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.149
 in June not that it is the three 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 but let's see how it's going 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.789
 practically all that has been 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.549
 talked about the stage a 4 has been 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.009
 shown and has also been confirmed 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.750
 so gentlemen it is confirmed that 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.689
 will show more on playstation 4 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.960
 will show the console already as a console and 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.270
 not as a prototype, so I do not 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.130
 dismissal I was ducsa live favorites comments 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.869

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.869
