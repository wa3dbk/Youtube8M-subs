00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 the German brand presented in January 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 2011 the family body variant 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.470
 or ranchera of the astra model that receives 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.599
 the name sport tourer 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.220
 in the Spanish market the bodies 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.320
 relatives do not matter 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.540
 reaching commercial in Italy and 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.610
 germany- but sales are going up and 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.100
 every time more rancheras are seen 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 roads 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.710
 from the front to the central pillar 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.620
 or see the sports tourer is identical to 5 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.600
 doors from this point the line 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.489
 of the roof goes down gently 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.140
 until you reach the lunette that is 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 quite leaning forward and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.210
 has a greater curvature than usual 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.699
 At the top of the bezel there is a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.850
 aerodynamic spoiler and the antenna is type 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.210
 shark fin the length of the astra 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.909
 sports tourer is 470 meters with a 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 width of 181 meters and a height of 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.200
 154 meters 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.530
 the carrier maintains the attributes of the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.280
 five doors although the capacity of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.560
 trunk 370 passes 500L that 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.270
 can expand up to two thousand 550 liters 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.540
 with only the front seats 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.729
 available this remarkable capacity is 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.369
 complements with practical elements such as 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.860
 the flex fault system of the backs 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.440
 rear that allows you to fold them with only 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.630
 pressing a button can optionally be 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.940
 have a protective carpet 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.830
 trunk that once deployed allows 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440
 protect the opening area of ​​the gate 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 the rear bumper and the backrests 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.230
 back when they are down 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.810
 the adaptive system of organization of the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.880
 flex trunk also arrange optional 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 consists of a set of networks and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270
 divisions that allow the owner 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 customize the configuration of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 cargo space there is no wheel 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.700
 only one kit is available 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.700
 puncture repair 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.780
 the passenger compartment has 25 liters of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.060
 volume for objects with bags in the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.490
 doors where it fits in bottles of 15 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.710
 liters a central console that allows 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.950
 various configurations and many others 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.950
 holes 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.620
 the astra sports tourer shares the same 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.349
 rear suspension and the system 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.909
 electromechanical chassis flexes that its 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.590
 five-door counterpart and the 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.069
 front suspension is taken from 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.989
 logo the propeller is a diesel from 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.970
 four cylinders in line and two liters 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.159
 of displacement that have a 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.930
 Sophisticated double system 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.930
 Sequential turbocharger 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.360
 a small turbocharger can rotate 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.120
 very fast when the engine is spinning 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.920
 under the regime this means that the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.800
 response to the accelerator pedal will 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.629
 produces without delay from 1500 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.970
 revolutions per minute the driver 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.769
 already it has at its disposal almost 90% 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.040
 of the maximum thrust torque that is very 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.319
 high 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.060
 in the middle range of revolutions enters 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.010
 in action a second turbo compressor more 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.379
 large and both turbochargers 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.269
 work together with the turbo 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.370
 bigger but compressing the air of 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.210
 admission before being compressed to higher 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.460
 pressure for the little one 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.920
 the result is a constant push and 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.690
 very high a valve controls the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.610
 exhaust gas flow between the two 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.740
 turbochargers 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.660
 from 3000 revolutions per 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.310
 minute all the exhaust gas flow 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.860
 goes directly to the turbo compressor 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.770
 big to provide the maximum 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.780
 power this propeller also counts 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.000
 with two heat exchangers or 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.310
 intercooler 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.590
 at low revolutions an intercooler 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.080
 Water cooled works coupled 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.670
 Turbo compressor small your work is 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.920
 ensure that the necessary volume of 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.600
 Compressed and cooled air arrives from 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.090
 fast and direct way to the camera 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800
 combustion it should be remembered that the air 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.690
 cold has a higher density and for 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.519
 so much oxygen needed 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.590
 for diesel fuel combustion 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.419
 at half speed the turbocharger more 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.509
 big and powerful is going into 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.979
 gradually working its biggest 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.199
 air flow is cooled with a 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.099
 conventional intercooler cooled by 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.099
 air and larger 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.180
 a direct injection system 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.800
 common-rail third generation that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.080
 works at pressures of up to 2,000 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.370
 bars supplies the fuel to about 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.680
 operating injectors 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.300
 piezoelectric and high precision that 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.580
 can perform up to eight phases of 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.110
 injection per cycle the process 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.870
 combustion is very precise what 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.780
 minimizes noise and emissions 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.370
 maximum power is 195 horses that 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.900
 they are transmitted to the front wheels to 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.900
 through a 6-speed manual transmission 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.720
 the benefits are good with 89 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.400
 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.280
 kilometers per hour and a speed 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.440
 maximum of 224 kilometers per hour 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.080
 the average consumption approved by opel is 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.420
 of 51 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.300
 our test we have measured 6.8 liters 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.260
 every 100 kilometers the figure is higher 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 to the homologated 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.240
 but still reasonable for a car of 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.889
 This power the size and performance 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.780
 materials and interior finishes are 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.030
 very cared for and include inserts 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.400
 decorative piano and plastic 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.550
 aluminum the dim ambient light is 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.650
 reddish another nod to sportsmanship 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.000
 the rear seats do not have 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.460
 yesterday's and orientable departures of 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.500
 air conditioner the rear windows 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.990
 they go down completely and the central square is 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.730
 uncomfortable the test unit counted 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.220
 with the option of sports seats and 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.380
 leather upholstery with perforated areas 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.480
 for better ventilation and red trim 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.730
 this option costs one thousand eight hundred ten 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.770
 euros and includes the heating of the 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.410
 front seats and lumbar adjustment 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.380
 electro hydraulic among other details 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.800
 the seats are comfortable and hold well 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.800
 the body 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.090
 the flying posture is well done and 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.370
 there is good support for the left foot 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.020
 once in march you enjoy the 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.289
 driving a dynamic car and 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.289
 balanced 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.439
 at the top of the console 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.149
 central there are some keys that allow 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.909
 select one more behavior 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:30.309
 sporty marked sport or comfortable 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.169
 marked turn but already in normal position 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.569
 the balance between comfort and effectiveness 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.429
 of march is very achieved direction 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:38.429
 and brakes fulfill their mission well
