00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.529
 So new tutorial and show today 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.160
 I tell you about the power fix profi of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 the laminate and parquet from better with 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 that has max how this works too 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 Here I have the damage at 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:37.230
 I am embarrassed because the parole is about 2 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.780
 centimeters long and have already been 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 Looked at the selection will be appreciated 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 bugs with the e take because good tip 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 on mission with the f 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 screw in the manual what one 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.350
 can mix or like a bit 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.410
 should now first time the e and recipe 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.320
 looks good but where will be 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 to prepare the damage site should 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.189
 one with the scraper or like that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.509
 the spatula should be the damage 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 cleaning of leftovers or water part 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 aware and the damage on the edge of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.500
 it works from planing and bascule 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 here but now a nice sharp edge 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.780
 So here's nothing everywhere 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.299
 nothing broken or what do i know what 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.909
 I personally think of the smelter 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.340
 bit stupid made meat is that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.479
 Products of trees such a boat dax 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 melter order 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:50.729
 you have to make a foul call and den 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.439
 shit lever forward carrier of that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:06.939
 the melting at all 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:09.479
 quasi works just the fastest it 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.479
 is fine 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:25.110
 somehow it's true with my smelter 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.110
 which is not okay now hot again 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:52.019
 Our country looks like that to me 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:54.790
 this title is again 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:19.379
 It's almost a call to me and it's just a game 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:19.379
 look at it again as drained 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.940
 the dry meat has a bit 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.300
 longer 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:49.650
 the csi customer would now have bockenheim 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:49.650
 I'll go over there carefully 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.440
 Critical and roulette is the wax 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:03.690
 out of the harm in there again 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:11.040
 then you should do that with the swim here 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 polish a bit 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.250
 if I do it with the Swabian 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.270
 you can see a little swimming polished 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.010
 now works so far from the of the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.040
 Old Town poses but brave one looked as 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.470
 entrepreneur is as before 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.410
 and when the work is melt 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.410
 if you are already the last trick is vienna off 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:46.040
 then it will be really good 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.010
 So work for the money the 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.820
 symbol into the smoker's okay 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.860
 be better 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.090
 they grow well from the waxes because they are 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.690
 cut ebay something may quality gives 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.650
 worse weather big differences 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.440
 give up at most and color variety ago 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.150
 yes , alexey miller style says so well 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.730
 practice does or annett 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.630
 without much fun when mending say 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.630
 fast there for them
