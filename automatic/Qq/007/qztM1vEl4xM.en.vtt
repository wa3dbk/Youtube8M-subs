 we end up on a day agents 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.130
 age geometry it's on ipad it seems 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.139
 beach party is absolutely never played 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.429
 but I have heard a lot about it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 we're going to start from the beginning 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.740
 a story to learn a little bit 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.289
 left 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.449
 wow it's no but no but I did not 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 the right there is a peak on over 100 m I 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.539
 take it from me it's not bad at what is 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 pass no but no but it's this douala 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 he has good it no no but down from 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.289
 level 1 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 it's out of the question to pass neither your 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.679
 insults fuse spoons refusal 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.590
 categorical in time but it c but that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.559
 it's level but it's outrageous 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 No, but I am in a state of invalidity 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 the more music she starts from 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 I felt in my head that they had a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.489
 little feeling a little like that the up 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.390
 I hate this noise but I think it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.160
 just take it in hand then 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.660
 then you are good what but yourself 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.770
 not like that for example okay his 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.180
 share on a missile and good pilots 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.500
 to her not bad I did not look at the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.039
 cams that after that went on a death I 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 know it's downright fucking good I 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.210
 know you're proud of me 56% 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.039
 but I need to have played during 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.899
 an hour and a half and if we do back on 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.920
 track everywhere chance wait I have 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.270
 turned off the music because actually 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.710
 I do not like it too much 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 will call it on purpose that's the worst 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 but I'm waiting for my guys, no, but there's 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 a problem there is the fatigue I 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 put the tiredness and excuses of all I 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.299
 believe in us but but I'm bad 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.920
 but I get angry - but this time I 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.800
 but it's crazy stuff underneath 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 hop hop hop hop 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.640

 this was not hop out four times 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.030
 with music I need to do 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.250
 lobotomize but we named both the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.690
 beneath the power of anyone 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.769
 come in me because anyone on 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.780
 the most powerful me on this game 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.180
 fucking I was like that I was when 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.519
 even that's too much to justify or even 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.680
 as it even resumes even that it 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.060
 it's not good I'm going to do it at the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.989
 music has changed anyway I'm 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.510
 switched to training mode for 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 void or and even when I'm not doing it on purpose 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.959
 I say to you will train you was zero 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.459
 we only have to make player noises 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.040
 tennis every time you jump 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.689
 up to aa 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.890
 here I do not know what to do 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.150
 this moment these moments of rest a little 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.250
 who has already caught the cops here 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.780
 absolutely nobody this is impossible 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.819
 I scratch date prevented from even years 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.129
 time aulas when the pro player the 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.329
 age geometry pgm we never went 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.040
 judge no hello I am leonardo dicaprio 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.329
 with a million times less style 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.680
 would that music not go through 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.970
 not plainly of course a speech a 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.129
 little with emotion here are the friends 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.670
 I had my diploma I leave you for 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.620
 to go to work 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.239
 and there he goes like that with a cloak 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.620
 of superman we do not know why and his 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.239
 friends are there with their mac do in the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.920
 hands and look at it oddly and get 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.709
 say atom c that it's not our friend 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.030
 do not know no that's the story that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.379
 cost me to her lives each time but 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.419
 the decor to speak a new color 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.889
 oh yes oh yes here we'll go it's 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.539
 about the power of the eyes and the 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.979
 purple mouth I prepared myself any 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.500
 my life to finally succeed this 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.699
 also important milestone that 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.220
 is orders his linen to pass the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.240
 level 1 of geometry dash in the name I 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.180
 almost lost almost lost 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.110
 no, but you hide it, but what 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.010
 con no yes yes yes 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.229

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:45.330
 Olympio level the bone but I am zero 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:50.220
 naturally we found the game where I 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.250
 am more of aa lot at aa all is well 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.250
 pass 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.210
 to the 400 is a small victory 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.960
 there I lose the wire must infuse 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.700
 for 5 seconds 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.330
 ah this is a way of expressing 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.440
 his dissatisfaction 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.760
 if you think there are people when 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.440
 they just downloaded the game there 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.880
 play and then and pass the levels 1 2 3 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.110
 4 like that quietly without any 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.570
 difficulty is what you think that 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.930
 these people have the pseudo squeeze no 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.090
 only to me I do not think already 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.010
 authorize betrayed not as if I die 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.840
 I support I wish I did 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.940
 I want to know more about 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.080
 the song that to know the following of 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.370
 levels does that when I go on 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.370
 itunes i find it buys it and then it 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.180
 I must want the euro but game 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.720
 why I take it verhille gilles 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.930
 until the end 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.700
 but why I indicated that 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.270
 bus week that's for me it's 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.260
 free what is it 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.840
 I find it almost a little too much 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.460
 simple here is a club first soul but 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.870
 the pressure should start at the g 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.730
 who goes wrong past shock ya a little 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.780
 feeling between me and this level here I am 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.860
 will propose to come with my 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.600
 restaurant a few times I have some 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.520
 little sentences or my brain he starts 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.500
 to understand he does to yes like that 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.400
 oh no but it's very rare for example 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:14.060
 a milk he unchecked ok ok the progress 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:17.899

 3 and I made 13% of the level of the first 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.719
 what do I think that if we go back 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:31.039
 and you're ingesting true twenty seven these 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:37.339
 days when I was born it's a sign 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:38.409
 let's go back to level 1 is what I 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.819

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:04.639
 level zero nick my ass hi good that's 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.779
 everything for brain bridge age geometry 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.219
 will literally explode and that's 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.110
 crazy because you've been hyper 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:10.490

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.499
 hard that I do not know I do not arrive 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.089
 absolutely not and I am very frustrated 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.379
 currently it's good I'm more 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:19.580
 frustrated sorry for the duration of the video 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.809
 at carlin who finds that sometimes my 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.979
 videos are too short but it depends 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:23.300
 sometimes that of videos of 8 9 10 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.529
 minutes of time of five to six minutes 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.879
 it depends on the game and saw that it is not 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.769
 badly repetitive and it is true that I 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.550
 rage or if not bad we will stop do you 

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:29.599
 do not do it we find ourselves very quickly 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.409
 in a new video she's 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.460
 short or long but it 's having 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.190
 watched icho everyone said that 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.190
 [Music]
