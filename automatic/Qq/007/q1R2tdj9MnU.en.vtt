00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
I'm going to show you a few more pieces

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
I'm going to show you a few more pieces
on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.829> short<00:01:41.100> ends<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.520> my<00:01:41.700> hair<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.720> I'm

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on the short ends of my hair then I'm

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
on the short ends of my hair then I'm
going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> move<00:01:43.229> over<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> longer<00:01:44.250> pieces

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
going to move over to the longer pieces

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.510 
going to move over to the longer pieces
on<00:01:45.060> top<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.659> head<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.770> movement<00:01:47.250> becomes

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
on top of my head this movement becomes

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
on top of my head this movement becomes
very<00:01:47.909> repetitive<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.810> once<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> rhythm

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
very repetitive so once you get a rhythm

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
very repetitive so once you get a rhythm
you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.790> move<00:01:50.939> through<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.210> hair<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.689> lot

you can move through your hair a lot

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
you can move through your hair a lot
faster<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.590> you're<00:01:53.040> wrapping<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.520> hair

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
faster as you're wrapping the hair

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.670 
faster as you're wrapping the hair
around<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:54.149> finger<00:01:54.540> bend<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.229> fingers

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
around your finger bend your fingers

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.219 
around your finger bend your fingers
slightly<00:01:56.390> continue<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.840> movement

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
slightly continue to do this movement

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
slightly continue to do this movement
over<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.250> until<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.090> start<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> pull

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
over and over until you start to pull

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
over and over until you start to pull
out<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.560> wider<00:02:01.950> circles<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.000> you'll

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
out and do wider circles and then you'll
