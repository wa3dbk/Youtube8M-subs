professional area I would divide that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.279 
professional area I would divide that
out<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.420> high-speed<00:00:51.930> stills

photographer and also the HD video so
what<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.149> find<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> within<00:01:00.899> each<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
what we find is that within each of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
what we find is that within each of
those<00:01:01.410> categories<00:01:01.649> there's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.969> lot<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
those categories there's a lot of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
those categories there's a lot of
emphasis<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> 1dx<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:05.040> improving<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
emphasis in the 1dx on improving the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
emphasis in the 1dx on improving the
performance<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> earlier<00:01:06.780> cameras<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
performance of the earlier cameras to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
performance of the earlier cameras to
address<00:01:08.220> each<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> those<00:01:08.640> needs<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
address each of those needs and so you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.770 
address each of those needs and so you
know<00:01:11.040> speaking<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.580> particular<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
know speaking in particular about the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
know speaking in particular about the
connectivity<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> biggest<00:01:14.820> thing<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
connectivity the biggest thing that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
connectivity the biggest thing that
changed<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> camera<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.860> fact<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
changed on this camera was the fact that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.810 
changed on this camera was the fact that
we<00:01:17.340> edited<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> built-in<00:01:18.689> wired<00:01:19.439> LAN<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we edited the built-in wired LAN so I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
we edited the built-in wired LAN so I
think<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.630> feature<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
think that feature is really going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.340 
think that feature is really going to
open<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> new<00:01:24.390> possibilities<00:01:24.630> for

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
open up a lot of new possibilities for

these photographers some of them will

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
say that the most important thing to

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.379 
say that the most important thing to
them<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.139> portability<00:04:28.560> aspect<00:04:29.389> we

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
them is the portability aspect we

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.529 
them is the portability aspect we
recently<00:04:30.630> introduced<00:04:31.410> our<00:04:32.190> shot<00:04:32.430> s100

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
recently introduced our shot s100

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.210 
recently introduced our shot s100
and<00:04:34.539> one<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.470> camp<00:04:35.680> one<00:04:35.979> of<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:36.130> features

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
and one of the camp one of the features

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.740 
and one of the camp one of the features
of<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.699> camera<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.479> makes<00:04:37.660> a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
of that camera that I think makes a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.960 
of that camera that I think makes a
difference<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.380> fact<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:39.160> brings<00:04:39.610> in

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
difference is the fact that it brings in

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.469 
difference is the fact that it brings in
the<00:04:40.479> 1080p<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:43.289> we<00:04:44.289> have<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:45.370> know<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.789> very

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
the 1080p so we have you know a very

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.080 
the 1080p so we have you know a very
small<00:04:47.229> compact<00:04:47.830> camera<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.610> does<00:04:48.729> extremely

small compact camera that does extremely

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.300

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
well in low light that does 1080p not at

of<00:05:37.750> camera<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.440> don't<00:05:38.919> think<00:05:38.979> that<00:05:39.280> there's<00:05:39.460> any

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
of camera I don't think that there's any

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.879 
of camera I don't think that there's any
reason<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.300> suppose<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.870> we're<00:05:41.650> going<00:05:41.800> to

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
reason to suppose that we're going to

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.420 
reason to suppose that we're going to
stop<00:05:42.120> but<00:05:43.120> at<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.110> same<00:05:44.380> token<00:05:44.560> the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
stop but at the same token the

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.219 
stop but at the same token the
challenges<00:05:46.030> are<00:05:46.180> now<00:05:46.360> tougher<00:05:46.960> than<00:05:46.990> they

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
challenges are now tougher than they

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.580 
challenges are now tougher than they
were<00:05:47.289> and<00:05:47.680> it<00:05:48.430> makes<00:05:48.729> it<00:05:48.969> an<00:05:49.479> important<00:05:50.020> for<00:05:50.229> us

were and it makes it an important for us

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.850 
were and it makes it an important for us

challenge<00:06:14.069> for<00:06:14.369> us<00:06:14.399> is<00:06:14.550> in<00:06:14.849> that<00:06:15.029> I<00:06:15.059> end<00:06:15.449> is

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
challenge for us is in that I end is

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.570 
challenge for us is in that I end is
that<00:06:15.779> we're<00:06:16.289> basically<00:06:16.709> at<00:06:16.889> a<00:06:17.069> price<00:06:17.369> point

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
that we're basically at a price point

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.519 
that we're basically at a price point
that<00:06:17.759> competes<00:06:18.300> directly<00:06:18.539> with<00:06:18.959> the<00:06:19.199> the

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
that competes directly with the the

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.589 
that competes directly with the the
low-end<00:06:19.860> SLRs<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:20.990> so<00:06:22.459> the<00:06:23.459> image<00:06:23.789> quality<00:06:24.059> of

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
low-end SLRs and so the image quality of

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.320 
low-end SLRs and so the image quality of
SLRs<00:06:25.289> versus<00:06:25.649> point2<00:06:26.099> becomes<00:06:26.490> a<00:06:26.759> matter<00:06:27.180> of

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
SLRs versus point2 becomes a matter of

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.989 
SLRs versus point2 becomes a matter of
comparison<00:06:27.990> and<00:06:28.189> that's<00:06:29.189> the<00:06:29.309> area<00:06:29.639> that<00:06:29.759> we

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
comparison and that's the area that we

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.909 
comparison and that's the area that we
need<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.330> really<00:06:30.809> I<00:06:30.839> believe<00:06:31.229> you<00:06:31.499> know<00:06:31.589> spend

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
need to really I believe you know spend

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.199 
need to really I believe you know spend
the<00:06:32.009> most<00:06:32.129> amount<00:06:32.249> of<00:06:32.430> time<00:06:32.610> on<00:06:32.789> g<00:06:32.999> series

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:33.209 
the most amount of time on g series

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.879 
the most amount of time on g series
we're<00:06:33.779> doing<00:06:33.959> pretty<00:06:34.110> good<00:06:34.289> in<00:06:34.349> terms<00:06:34.619> of

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
we're doing pretty good in terms of

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.189 
we're doing pretty good in terms of

quality with a cheap camera but there's
room<00:06:39.479> for<00:06:39.509> improvement<00:06:39.719> we'll<00:06:40.589> check<00:06:40.709> i<00:06:40.770> want

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919
