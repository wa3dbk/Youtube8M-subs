00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:11.330
 hello you see here just the sony vaio 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.789
 lm in 1 11 inch multitouch tablet 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.600
 slider convertible device I would now 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:23.190
 times to see the reason here 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.820
 is a tablet with a slider and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:31.260
 a keyboard underneath a whole 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 new concept of a convertible by him 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 short on the whole device we have 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.850
 like I said an 11 inch display this 11 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.800
 inch display supports multitouch 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.629
 gestures as we always see it here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 I turn it on if that's enabled yes 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:57.329
 nice so here you can see it multitouch 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 super fast so supple but everything 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.899
 we come first to the device itself 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.269
 I think that together again 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.210
 so that we can look at first 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.010
 what else we have left to you 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.370
 we have the top of the device we have 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.890
 up here a webcam 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.780
 these resolved with full hd resolution 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.120
 yes, just another webcam on 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.330
 the back is located 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 Here you see them then we stay 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 right on the back we have 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.080
 that's another interesting thing here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.150
 We have two feet working out 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.920
 can fold 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.920
 the whole thing looks like it can do that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.730
 whole area opens up a bit steep 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 to set the table 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.580
 it is not much, but it is something 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.220
 furthermore, it is here and there 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.520
 another small pin connector and elisa 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 shut up with another one 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.850
 I can dock additional battery 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.080
 I would have these two slots 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.330
 or 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.130
 here on the side again somehow 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.530
 be used 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.239
 Let's keep looking around us 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.670
 we find a few buttons below 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.760
 it would be the volume 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.650
 control as well as the orientation run 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.680
 or the screen lock 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.080
 that the picture does not turn any further 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.720
 and the sony vaio s is button over the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.599
 Do you come to a sony software with her 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.430
 Set up your rio a bit 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.690
 could 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.200
 and of course the speakers are located 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.400
 here we go, too 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 the front 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.910
 we see a couple of notification leds like 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 you can see here also the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.860
 buttons that is a bit rounded 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.200
 Beveled here is more the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.549
 notification leds for wlan battery status 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.079
 standby or hard drive activity 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.040
 we on the left side of the device we 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:07.700
 see a 3 5 mm port for headphones 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:10.940
 sds people this sd sdhc and mmc 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.560
 vga-port so you can your device completely 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.609
 simply connect to the monitor via 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.220
 vga is on the right side 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.819
 the preparation of a full value of the hdmi 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.310
 connection as well as two usb 3.0 ports one 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.680
 of it with charge plus that's you 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.980
 can your cell phone or something very easy 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.739
 load it yes we make the device still 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.160
 times on machines is on again 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.060
 no laptop sense unfortunately we look at that 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.299
 from the side 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.680
 we see the slider mechanism here 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.780
 So really with the hack here 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.310
 down where he gets hacked does that 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.150
 a very stable impression it wobbles 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.120
 not very much 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.340
 So you can see at a temptation 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.790
 to show 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.450
 it weighs minimal it really is 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.459
 I think that's very stable 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.900
 made a very pleasant impression 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.830
 Particularity is still when I always 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.450
 make the display again we have 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.190
 next to the multi touch or the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.950
 possibility here over a trackball 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.049
 to control the whole thing 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.180
 the whole year is not the easy one 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 because the trackball is really accurate 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.729
 But the surface reacts easily 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.600
 is small to overlap and 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.740
 of course, still mouse buttons down here 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.889
 left click right click middle click 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.110
 not everything 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.210
 otherwise -8 should be known 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.950
 about the gestures to use here completely 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.610
 easy pinch to zoom works 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.290
 multitouch is also given here what is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.479
 We still have to say about the device 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.430
 have come here on the back yet 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.510
 time to add the note that nfc 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.800
 was built 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.780
 that is, the nfc chip will become 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.360
 You can find it somewhere below 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.690
 Easily exchange your data and you 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.020
 your smartphone is holding or something and 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.510
 I think that is especially good 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.100
 which is supplied to the digitizer that 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.979
 it is a pen 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.720
 you can see him here with you here 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.570
 simply draw the device very easy 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.539
 or we can paint one day 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.100
 new thing new document take us 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.150
 here in the nice pen and mine 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.110
 Just let me and what I actually do 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.820
 So I wanted to show my hand 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.110
 with me on it when I donate the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.610
 I can paint punishment here 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.700
 as soon as the pen is close by 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:48.790
 the handball will not be here anymore 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:51.860
 signed yes, yes 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.540
 beautiful thing actually can be 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.230
 definitely mobile on the go very well 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.860
 working the device will harm you if it does 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.840
 you like yes as I said great thing 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.510
 I like a great new concept 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.650
 actually leave me quite well 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.540
 but your opinion in the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.620
 comments to 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.340
 Thank you for watching and in any case 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.340
 until next time
