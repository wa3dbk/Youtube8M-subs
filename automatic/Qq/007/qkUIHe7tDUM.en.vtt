the<00:00:07.890> dead<00:00:08.069> space<00:00:08.389> the<00:00:09.389> animation<00:00:09.930> that<00:00:10.139> we

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the dead space the animation that we

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.100 
the dead space the animation that we
tried<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> go<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:10.680> is<00:00:11.190> very<00:00:11.639> realistic<00:00:12.210> when

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
tried to go for is very realistic when

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.960 
tried to go for is very realistic when
it<00:00:13.200> comes<00:00:13.379> down<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> making<00:00:13.920> something<00:00:14.400> scary

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:14.970 
it comes down to making something scary

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.710 
it comes down to making something scary
it's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.780> lot<00:00:15.960> more<00:00:16.020> than<00:00:16.290> just<00:00:16.529> an<00:00:16.920> animation

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.880 

one<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> things<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.109> game<00:00:22.440> animation

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
one of the things about game animation

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.179 
one of the things about game animation
is<00:00:23.279> especially<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.029> main<00:00:24.210> character

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
is especially with the main character

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.700 
is especially with the main character
gameplay<00:00:26.189> comes<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.820> since<00:00:27.750> day<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.230> we've

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
gameplay comes first since day one we've

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
gameplay comes first since day one we've
gone<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.630> thinking<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.350> quality

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gone for the thinking that it's quality

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560 
gone for the thinking that it's quality
over<00:00:31.980> quantity<00:00:32.010> there<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:33.030> times<00:00:33.210> when<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
over quantity there are times when you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.570 
over quantity there are times when you
might<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.960> interrupt<00:00:34.199> an<00:00:34.500> animation<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
might have to interrupt an animation you

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.040 
might have to interrupt an animation you
know<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.150> really<00:00:36.600> want<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
know because you really want to be this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.720 
know because you really want to be this
quality<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.750> takes<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
quality you know and that takes a lot of

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.760 
quality you know and that takes a lot of
you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> blending<00:00:42.570> between

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
you know kind of blending between

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.720 
you know kind of blending between
animations<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> harder

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
animations and that's one of the harder

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
animations and that's one of the harder
things<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> don't

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
things to get right because you don't

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
things to get right because you don't
want<00:00:46.800> him<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> running

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
want him to you're just kind of running

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
want him to you're just kind of running
then<00:00:48.300> stop<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> there's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> weird<00:00:49.170> animation

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
then stop and there's a weird animation

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
then stop and there's a weird animation
of<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.250> attacking<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.969> takes<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of them attacking so that takes a lot of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
of them attacking so that takes a lot of
work<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.820> stuff<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.450> be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
work all that stuff is going to be

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.450 
work all that stuff is going to be
seamless<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> Necromorph<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.160> striding

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
seamless so the Necromorph is striding

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
seamless so the Necromorph is striding
along<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> he<00:00:57.180> sees<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.050> turn<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
along and he sees you you can turn and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
along and he sees you you can turn and
immediately<00:00:59.370> come<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> attack<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> without

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
immediately come to attack you without

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.529 
immediately come to attack you without
stopping<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.100> turning<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:02.969> coming<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
stopping and turning and coming to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.930 
stopping and turning and coming to
attack<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.020> it's<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:05.129> trying<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
attack you it's it's all about trying to

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.370 
attack you it's it's all about trying to
make<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> feel<00:01:06.300> if<00:01:06.690> you're<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> world

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
make you feel if you're in the world

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.760 
make you feel if you're in the world
with<00:01:07.619> those<00:01:07.800> creatures<00:01:09.200> Isaac<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> whole

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
with those creatures Isaac has a whole

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
with those creatures Isaac has a whole
new<00:01:11.100> set<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> animations<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.060> zero<00:01:12.270> gravity

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
new set of animations in zero gravity

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.950 
new set of animations in zero gravity
with<00:01:13.140> Isaac<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.830> tried<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> figure<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> way

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
with Isaac we tried to figure out a way

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.370 
with Isaac we tried to figure out a way
that<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.260> could<00:01:16.409> mocap<00:01:17.390> zero-g<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that we could mocap zero-g because it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
that we could mocap zero-g because it
was<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> such<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> broad<00:01:20.479> motion<00:01:21.479> set

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
was going to be such a broad motion set

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.950 
was going to be such a broad motion set
and<00:01:21.930> basically<00:01:22.200> repeating<00:01:22.799> full<00:01:23.250> motion<00:01:23.490> set

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
and basically repeating full motion set

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
and basically repeating full motion set
regular<00:01:24.960> g<00:01:25.170> +<00:01:25.380> 0<00:01:25.710> g<00:01:25.920> which<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.549> daunting<00:01:27.270> task

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
regular g + 0 g which is a daunting task

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
regular g + 0 g which is a daunting task
his<00:01:27.960> walk<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.860> had<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> feel<00:01:29.580> like

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
his walk as we had to make it feel like

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.179 
his walk as we had to make it feel like
any<00:01:30.000> had<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> magnetic<00:01:30.810> boots<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
any had the magnetic boots on it and you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.860 
any had the magnetic boots on it and you
know<00:01:32.220> he's<00:01:32.460> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.700> stomping<00:01:33.119> around

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
know he's kind of stomping around

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.900 
know he's kind of stomping around
the<00:01:34.740> speeds<00:01:35.040> had<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.370> be<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.730> bit

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
the speeds had to be a little bit

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.200 
the speeds had to be a little bit
changed<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.660> slower<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:38.120> you<00:01:39.120> know

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
changed and slower and you know

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
changed and slower and you know
everything<00:01:39.720> about<00:01:39.810> him<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.260> strengthening

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
everything about him is strengthening

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.820 
everything about him is strengthening
all<00:01:41.550> new<00:01:42.000> animations<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.410> characters

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
all new animations and the characters

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.410 
all new animations and the characters
that<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.130> into<00:01:44.310> zero<00:01:44.610> junior<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.210> way

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that go into zero junior the same way

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.150 
that go into zero junior the same way
you<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.320> went<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.920> went<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
you know we went up that we went to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.070 
you know we went up that we went to
Vancouver<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.030> started<00:01:48.420> doing<00:01:48.510> our<00:01:48.690> boat<00:01:48.870> cap

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
Vancouver and started doing our boat cap

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.720 
Vancouver and started doing our boat cap
and<00:01:49.320> were<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.530> okay<00:01:49.770> how<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.010> we<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.250> zero<00:01:50.460> g

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
and were like okay how can we do zero g

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.330 
and were like okay how can we do zero g
and<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.710> tried<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and you know we tried just kind of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.070 
and you know we tried just kind of
mimicking<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.090> walking<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.480> zero<00:01:54.690> g<00:01:54.900> and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
mimicking like walking in zero g and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.050 
mimicking like walking in zero g and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
behind me with the bungee cables as I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.540 
behind me with the bungee cables as I
kind<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.960> did<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.890> big<00:02:14.190> sort<00:02:14.430> of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
kind of like did this this big sort of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.420 
kind of like did this this big sort of
stepping<00:02:14.970> look<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.980> that's<00:02:17.130> what<00:02:17.310> we

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
stepping look and so that's what we

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.270 
stepping look and so that's what we
started<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.240> zero<00:02:18.510> g<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
started with with zero g and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.260 
started with with zero g and
surprisingly<00:02:20.280> enough<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.790> actually<00:02:20.880> feels

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
surprisingly enough it actually feels

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.150 
surprisingly enough it actually feels
pretty<00:02:21.450> good<00:02:21.720> sort<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.350> magnetic<00:02:22.800> boots

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
pretty good sort of like magnetic boots

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.510 
pretty good sort of like magnetic boots
sort<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.610> feel<00:02:23.790> walking<00:02:24.650> Isaac<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
sort of feel walking Isaac and I in so

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.560 
sort of feel walking Isaac and I in so
many<00:02:26.670> ways<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.210> think<00:02:27.360> we've<00:02:27.480> ever

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
many ways I don't think we've ever

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.560 
many ways I don't think we've ever
really<00:02:28.010> counted<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.310> every<00:02:30.240> different

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
really counted because every different

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.410 
really counted because every different
part<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.960> him<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.560> cut<00:02:31.860> off<00:02:32.210> maybe<00:02:33.210> I'm

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
part of him can be cut off maybe I'm

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
part of him can be cut off maybe I'm
just<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.810> demented<00:02:34.530> person<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.040> don't<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.400> but

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just a demented person I don't know but

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.790 
just a demented person I don't know but
you<00:02:36.300> know<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.450> would<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:36.990> as<00:02:37.320> soon<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.680> would

you know I would out as soon as I would

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.110 
you know I would out as soon as I would
see<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> character<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.670> would<00:02:38.820> see<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
see a character and I would see the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.300 
see a character and I would see the
blades<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:40.020> would<00:02:40.200> see<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.980> spikes
