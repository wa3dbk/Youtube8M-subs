00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
like where that is you'll just cover it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.590 
like where that is you'll just cover it
smooth<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.110> out<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:51.050> keep<00:01:51.229> going<00:01:52.450> does<00:01:53.450> it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
smooth it out and keep going does it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.230 
smooth it out and keep going does it
matter<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:54.500> size<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.280> pieces<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:55.820> because

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
matter what size the pieces are because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.960 
matter what size the pieces are because
you're<00:01:56.390> overlapping<00:01:57.050> them<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> it's<00:01:58.729> going<00:01:58.880> to

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
you're overlapping them so it's going to

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.050 
you're overlapping them so it's going to
give<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.840> very<00:02:00.320> human<00:02:00.860> pattern<00:02:01.160> with<00:02:01.640> every
