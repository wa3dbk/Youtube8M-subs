the<00:06:47.939> biggest<00:06:48.150> problem<00:06:48.779> is<00:06:48.990> for<00:06:49.469> all<00:06:49.650> these

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
the biggest problem is for all these

the biggest problem is for all these
dinosaurs<00:06:50.189> is<00:06:50.819> that<00:06:51.449> there<00:06:51.629> is<00:06:51.779> no<00:06:51.990> other
