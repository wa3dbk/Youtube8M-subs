00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi everyone how are they today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.620
 I bring a review of 4 labials that I 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.150
 they have loved it delighted and that for me and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.870
 also for what I was looking for on the internet 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 they are like one of the line crimes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.910
 velvet intel and frame but of course 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 it's a much much cheaper option and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 affordable that the lines we believe in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.380
 chile more or less bring us like 17 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 up to 20 thousand pesos 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
 these labials are called long lasting 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.059
 lip gloss but the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 why are they called clean because they are from 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 matte finish are good almost the same 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 formulas that of the printing press 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.969
 they apply liquidly and then they 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 transform mate and I have these 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 four colors and the truth is that they are 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.789
 precious in the camera does not capture the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 alive that are authorship of previous that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.370
 I did was with this color and now I'm going 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 to show the switches and let's see 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 then a review of prices and everything 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.870
 I'm going to start with the lighter color 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.609
 what is this at number 18 do not have 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 name only have number in the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.409
 camera looks a little pinker than 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.840
 What is it 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.899
 colder than warm and they say it's like 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 the cashmere dup of the velvet in and 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.850
 I'm going to make the switch in Milan 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.130
 Now I'm going to wait for this to dry 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.810
 It takes approximately 30 seconds 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.299
 maximum that would be color 18 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.190
 and the labial was dried in about 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.060
 30 seconds a little more 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.230
 As you can see, nothing is transferred 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.450
 and that would be the dream of this second 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.630
 the truth is that this color looks a lot 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.120
 more red on camera than it is is a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.250
 pretty color thrown for him plus the 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.190
 It came that red but it really is 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 a color but precious precious to me 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.910
 loved this color maybe one of my 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.470
 favorites half stripe that looks red in 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.350
 screen because you really do not see it 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.480
 dry almost instantaneously when applied 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.830
 be a little bit dried faster than 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.280
 the previous one and let's see if it 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.280
 transfer 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.590
 I'm going to leave photos to see 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.150
 the actual colors of the labials and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 now let's make the next switch 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.099
 now let's go with this color number 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.020
 25 and this the color that I used in the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.349
 previous tutorial let's do the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.349
 switch 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.090
 as you can see is a super super lip 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.070
 pigmented is good just like everything 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.110
 other and the camera looks a little further 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.170
 day of what it really is a color 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.670
 very very similar to the lines craig utopia 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.560
 as you can see at the beginning when 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.780
 I started talking I was still bright 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.330
 and now it's kills will have passed as 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.600
 20 seconds to the environment a live color 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.150
 this is a super super strong color almost 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.910
 Neon is like a pinkish fuchsia 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.800
 pretty pretty pretty 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.860
 Now let's try the last tone that 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.440
 it's number 28 and it's this red but 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.600
 beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful i 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.210
 I see this way live and I find it equal to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.250
 red velvet the line crime in the camera 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.680
 it's a bit more orange but it's not 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.540
 a red like that of the curtain that looks 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.340
 it's like the red of this we're going to do the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.630
 switch to see what's up because this has 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.670
 been the only one that I have not tried 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.670
 still so let's see how it turns out 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.190
 that the pigmentation of these labials is 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.190
 really amazing 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.990
 let's count how many seconds 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.510
 delay in drying you can see that the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.550
 the color is completely matte in 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.860
 I really live I do not know how good to imagine 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.410
 how it is different in the camera is a 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.380
 too powerful red too 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.960
 vibrant a tone hardly that they're going 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.880
 to find in another brand more or less 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.710
 accessible because I really have not 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.260
 seen the closest thing I've seen the 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.300
 patricia or redford hardware 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.980
 request but it 's not matte finish and 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.690
 it's really easy for me to really 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.370
 I'm fascinated dizzy more with these 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.040
 lipsticks really has super super 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.650
 happy because I did not have no 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.360
 found nothing similar to the line 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.550
 crime 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400
 and so cheap really that I did not 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.290
 I expect such good quality I have 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840
 in love these lipsticks really that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.700
 if I could I would order all the tones 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.040
 that have the variety of tones is 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.960
 incredible are like 40 color we are going to 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.180
 talk about how they behave during the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.770
 day is this the rod resects quite 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.110
 so I recommend that before 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.970
 apply it exfoliates on the lips or it 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 put on a moisturizing balm and then 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.760
 withdraw the excess to pass the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.430
 hours tend 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.870
 takes off a bit from the inner edge and 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.960
 you start to feel with a little more 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.370
 tight is a situation totally 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.350
 bearable since I feel the same with 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.060
 the lifeline widget but I do not care 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.740
 because it looks so beautiful the truth is that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.510
 with the weekend of the intro also happens 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.670
 practically the same and it's almost the 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.490
 same process and another day use this color 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.370
 which is the 22 I used it all day I 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.460
 I put in the morning like at 11 12 of the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.130
 tomorrow and 9 o'clock is only had here 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.260
 a little shell 2 I'm going to leave a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.480
 picture around here that I took that day to 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.230
 show them and I that day obviously with 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.720
 my drink etc with my bread and 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.790
 cookies I had that clear doctor 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.430
 only here in the center or one thing 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.160
 that is super cable challenge because if you already 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.380
 I had the night does not deal with sales again 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.300
 and all that you can reapply but 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.720
 in the center would be super good the 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.340
 page to which he sent me this is to go back and 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.930
 store that I have already made several 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.540
 collaborations with him as to 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.150
 prices are very very cheap this is 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.260
 the road costs them two dollars with 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.950
 29 cents Chilean plates would be like 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.410
 about 1300 pesos at half the price of a 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.710
 radiant patrician and you take a life 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.630
 Fully matte long-lasting with 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.020
 lovely colors and a variety 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.570
 amazing so I really do not see him 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.490
 the negative points to these lipsticks if 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.530
 you want to buy these lipsticks 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.760
 They can also have a 10% discount 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.310

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.410
 10 that will have a 10% discount on 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.880
 In addition, it is going to be more 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.160
 cheap of what they are enchanted 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.860
 they loved it and they are totally matte not 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.900
 they transfer as you can see they do not 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.120
 they transfer nothing nothing nothing so 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.590
 They can give quiet pesitos I hope 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.980

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.900
