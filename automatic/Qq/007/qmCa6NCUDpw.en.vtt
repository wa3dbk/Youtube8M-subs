this<00:00:12.960> year<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.469> think<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.610> thing<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> has

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
this year I think the one thing that has

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
this year I think the one thing that has
been<00:00:15.949> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> forefront<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:18.170> the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
been kind of the forefront of the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.490 
been kind of the forefront of the
culture<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.119> even<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.390> mind<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.050> fast

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
culture and even in my mind is how fast

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.140 
culture and even in my mind is how fast
and<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.220> far<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.810> whole<00:00:25.109> movement<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
and how far this this whole movement is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.599 
and how far this this whole movement is
starting<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> expand<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.320> almost<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
starting to expand and almost to the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
starting to expand and almost to the
point<00:00:29.789> where<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.240> cannibalizing<00:00:31.109> itself

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
point where it's cannibalizing itself

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
point where it's cannibalizing itself
and<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> same<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.510> re<00:00:34.700> generating

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and and at the same time re generating

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
and and at the same time re generating
new<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.899> interesting<00:00:38.420> ideas<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> art<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.200> so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
new and interesting ideas and art and so

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
new and interesting ideas and art and so
on<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.860> forth<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.520> i<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:42.149> i'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
on and so forth so i think i'm going to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.160 
on and so forth so i think i'm going to
start<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.680> talking<00:00:44.250> about<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:45.170> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
start off with talking about how the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
start off with talking about how the
continuing<00:00:46.770> acceptance<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:50.059> interest<00:00:51.059> in

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
continuing acceptance and interest in

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
continuing acceptance and interest in
graffiti<00:00:52.110> culture<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> b-boy<00:00:53.100> culture<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
graffiti culture and b-boy culture and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.600 
graffiti culture and b-boy culture and
specific<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.620> rap<00:00:55.620> music<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> way

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
specific because rap music and in a way

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
specific because rap music and in a way
has<00:00:56.969> had<00:00:57.270> its<00:00:57.449> day<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.489> DJing

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
has had its day and and and so has DJing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
has had its day and and and so has DJing
and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.020> becoming<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and so now this is becoming the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
and so now this is becoming the
prevalent

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.330
