00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.150
 there 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.470
 montpellier 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.470
 good year bad year 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 monday the country 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.870
 it does not stop judging the bonus game with however a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.020
 mistake in the heats in high-saona duty in 2007 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.050
 people were killed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.930
 relatively expected because he thought only a little game c 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.340
 the complete game 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 I complete 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.850
 more than the first game had a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 a success 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.680
 quite high in the community chain 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.110
 it's a game that was eagerly awaited by fans 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.510
 thanks to the rather limited public service 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 of the game and the universe of the net 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.479
 yet the world's first 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.990
 the internship that had a structure 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.620
 is experienced Algerian will have to eat not really realistic at 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.270
 before the very last level 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170
 for the rest it changes completely will be used for a brief 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 story that really starts from the very beginning 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.420
 I'm really the end of the game 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.490
 so we have an organization that differs from a first in the sense that we have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.969
 ideas 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.190
 the goal the usual test phase so d 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.609
 the rooms where we have to 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:25.480
 saleh of a point 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.810
 a point b using a portal gun inc 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.690
 coming back from the cold water as the first 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.250
 the tunes of tango finding flattering visit the back of the game scenery 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.350
 So the back of the torture set Saint-witz 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 and she will discover a little 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 the stories of the place 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.490
 interact with the different actors of the game 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 so there really is a new narrative structure tonight 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.640
 a little more coherence 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.700
 to the progression in the game he has thus left a progression that is more 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.420
 fluid 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.550
 even if he is still 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 at a big empty passage 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.250
 m in the middle of the game 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.270
 so this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.690
 ajax harangue source 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.460
 it reinforces the coherence of the universe had not become so absurd 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.100
 it still gives + 2 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.909
 more interest at ten months 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.409
 to the whole game rather than the club really to be uninterested in 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.389
 test phases that ultimately are never just bank tests 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 maybe not hyper interesting from a narrative point of view 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.609
 one of the big new portal 2 so obviously it's the coop mode that 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.449
 lets play this game on both consoles and pc 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.889
 thanks to our help we discover the beginning of the game this time with the cape 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.349
 portel we each 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.859
 caracas - portal 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.169
 we also discover a new mechanic 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.129
 but I think the show is the trampoline and light gun that 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.999
 allow 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.439
 to travel in the air the laser system the rock paintings very quickly 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.519
 to jump very high 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.370
 that's all 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.370
 all all this little news 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.869
 the couple relatively shorter than the solo his also from two 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:53.769
 start 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.939
 all these novelties of gameplay is the muse 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.349
 there are advanced elements a little later solo 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.279
 we also have an alternative project during this shift from one mode 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.569
 multiplayer completely without a speech for me anyway 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 something interesting on a five year plan in a week 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.449
 there is also a package job 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.919
 by volvo will facilitate communication between the two players 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.179
 since we can obviously communicate 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.949
 vocally either on pc or on console also a system of pink 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.739
 pretty well done and that allows 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.419
 the indicated easily our colleague to the avalats beaten on his soul and funk 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.129
 why his interesting moc agreement may be enjoying 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.590
 dabo more interested he had had longer zeniths and more 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.049
 complicated 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.299
 portal first of the world 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.840
 it was an all terrain game become the world of severe roller skating that those of 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:44.549
 fulham 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.879
 cuse all this craze beyond the game's exit 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.109
 but it's a game that also had a year let's all say unreserved and a 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.540
 refinement in his humor we had some replicas was funny of 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.879
 situations that was funny but it's still pink 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.599
 thus spent the black enough disturbing 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.159
 it's really wondering 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.749
 yes it is also asked how were we going out of there wondered what 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.609
 was the interest of these experiments 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.559
 christine finally been offered primarily by executives from the 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.859
 Saint Sylvester 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.879
 it's a concept 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.729
 the most directive humor has been 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.729
 may be expanded to reach a wider audience and 7 passes 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.069
 the fact is that it is obviously on the trails 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.270
 person to a lot more absurd 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 I also have a lot more systematic in a world very rarely there would be 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.460
 more leader of the game's character band 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.100
 it's a joke story at one time or another we've 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.179
 also a game world that are much more absurd our exploration 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.749
 the reverse side of the aperture 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.099
 all the players have made an organization that only lends enough 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.559
 crazy 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.579
 to which it is difficult to believe that suddenly much less are striking 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.939
 gold I think it serves the game 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.819
 partially particular and not just in co-op hours because we got 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.800
 a lot of aftershocks that eventually becomes pretty repetitive 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.689
 some are also quite heavy 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.590
 in a suburb 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.020
 the middle of the game chapters 6 sec particular 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.749
 let's admit that 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.110
 without breaking the fast 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.790
 today the killers my idol anyway 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.409
 it's often a novak his job here 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.649
 but a choice in that we still lost a good deal of the spirit with 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.550
 self 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.490
 this change of 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.490
 from humor to strength 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.199
 portal 2 is a game that they are freed and successfully from its 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.279
 origins of luxury kilos 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.479
 originally people were waiting to ski 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.650
 orange box 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.419
 before the release of portable monster hunter 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.879
 so I think it's a success for them who have AIDS 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.610
 to really exploit this new universe active input to make it a 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.909
 franchise which in my opinion it should continue from behind 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.479
 for the regional I think obviously portal 2 is an inevitable 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.889
 although overall I think the game could have been much better especially 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.759
 with greater difficulty 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.759
 with hours a body humor was more faithful to the original 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.150
 the solo 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.369
 of relatively long this gold nowadays this plate or not 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.369
 and the ovule kooples relatively interesting are still eh 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.699
 very nice to follow despite the fact that it is really no replayability 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.379
 which is the case in games and nimes 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.059
 which is a bit of a pity
