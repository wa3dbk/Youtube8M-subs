00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.370
 how about friends of geek arm and I hope that 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.280
 have had a nice holiday 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.670
 decembrinas I bring you this time 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 other a boxing in this case is 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 a cellular clone of the blackberry z10 I sent 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.300
 to ask for three china teams because they are 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.140
 for a gift originally they should 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 get there before 25 but it was not like that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.940
 we are already in the last days of the month 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.399
 December and finally it has arrived 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.399
 let's proceed to the opening 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 plus 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.690
 As you can see, the box is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.800
 quite minimalist only brings the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.950
 name of the model on the top 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.590
 it's about how I tell you a clone of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.600
 Blackberry Z10 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.869
 let's proceed to open nothing else a 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.869
 box 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 yes 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 here they have it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.660
 the finish looks pretty 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.620
 resistant is a metallic material 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.450
 different from what I've seen in other 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.720
 Cell phones are usually very 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.790
 plastics in this case the finish is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.280
 this metallic 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.280
 very good appearance very resistant 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.440
 let's see what the box contains 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.440
 the box contains a handsfree 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:34.070
 Wall charger with USB input 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.070
 USB cable for data and charging 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.060
 a battery of 1800 thousand jumpers and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.720
 surely there is an extra battery 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 we'll see 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.590
 if it actually brings an extra battery 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.360
 already installed 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.360
 let's close it again 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.390
 and we are going to proceed to the first start 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.440
 apparently I think it does not bring cargo 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.099
 it turns out that he had a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.959
 protection so that the battery was not 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.260
 making contact so you do not 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.300
 it will wear out I imagine it will be removed and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.300
 now let's turn on the computer 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.769
 this equipment has features 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.659
 limited in terms of cameras the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.959
 front camera is just point 3 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.939
 megapixels and the rear camera is 2 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.299
 megapixels it's really about a 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.000
 low- end equipment in that sense the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.030
 team to the dollar exchange was 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.549
 costing around 800 pesos without 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.549
 However, it brings a good processor 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.830
 to 1.6 and bring this 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.349
 android 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.340
 4.2 let's see if we can see it 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:39.260
 here 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.260
 Android 4.2.2 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.560
 the equipment can be expanded up to 32 GB 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.169
 has a 4-inch screen is dual 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.259
 sim and 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.590
 what else brings two batteries as they 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.080
 commented one of 1800 and the one that brings 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.639
 Now it is 2 thousand 200 thousand yen 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.279
 what is quite acceptable and about 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.930
 all taking into account that when this 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.699
 stack and stop working properly 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.699
 Well, you can have a spare 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.330
 the team is pretty fluid 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.880
 and as I said , you can not ask them 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.520
 a lot to the camera 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.990
 While this was the boxing clone him 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.990
 Blackberry Z10 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.190
 If later I have the opportunity to 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.750
 do a thorough review of your 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:01.060
 performance with pleasure I share it and 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.060
 I will share with you until later
